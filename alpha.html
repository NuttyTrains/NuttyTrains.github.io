<p>       The Alpha adventures were never intended to be Nutty Trains adventures at the time, but in hindsight, they formed the 
	  basis and the inspiration for all our future adventures. The alpha adventures took place when we were both still in 
	  school, as part of school trips. The first, αI, to Bath in December 2015, was James's first experience with trains, 
	  and one of Matthew's first too. The second, α2, was the direct successor to that trip, to London in December 2016.

<div class="content">
<p>       Back in December 2015, a joint Business Studies & Latin school trip was organised to Bath, for the Latin students 
          to visit the Roman baths, and for the Business students to study the Christmas market. Both groups would then be given 
	  time to explore the city (including Matthew visiting a 5* Indian Restaurant in a dodgy alleyway), before heading home. 
	  However, the real highlight of the trip were the train journeys there and back. 
          <br><br>
          The group met at Swansea train station on that cold December morning, and James was especially excited to be 
	  travelling on his first train, even though he was still a bus addict at the time. Experiencing a GWR HST from Swansea 
	  to Newport was the first step to converting him though! We then changed to a 3-car GWR DMU, which had been fully 
	  reserved, forcing everyone to stand in the corridor all the way to Bath. Along the way, one of our classmates (Jake) nearly 
	  got decapitated by a passing train whilst sticking his head out of the window. This was going to be a fun trip.
	  <br><br>
	  The Roman baths were optime according to Matthew, whilst James enjoyed the Christmas Market very much. Matthew later 
	  went to the Eastern Eye - a 5* Indian restaurant in a dodgy alleyway, before wandering aimlessly around the city 
	  centre. James also wandered around aimlessly, but omitted the restaurant bit. James was able to explore the shopping 
	  centre (this later became a running theme in NT adventures), whilst Matthew managed to stumble upon Pulteney Bridge, 
	  and watched a different classmate (Scott) throw himself onto the road in front of a moving bus to retrieve his rugby 
	  ball. Despite later adventures consisting of just Matthew and James, we strive to uphold this level of nuttiness and 
	  risk our lives as frequently in all our adventures.
	  <br><br>
	  The journey back was less eventful, as night drew in. Once again, we changed at Newport onto a HST, and headed back to 
	  Swansea (Matthew alighting at Neath). This adventure was the earliest precursor to our NT adventures, but it was also 
	  an important component of the foundation of our friendship.

<div class="content">
<p>       1 year later, and after the success of the Bath trip, a follow-up school trip was planned, this time just for Latin 
	  students, to the British Museum in London. Firstly, we had to arrive even earlier at Swansea station, to catch a GWR 
	  HST all the way to Paddington. Matthew turned up in his tweed jacket, assuming that this trip would include a trip to 
	  a fancy restaurant like the last one, but this didn't happen. The only result was that he looked sorely out of place! 
	  <br><br>
	  This was still one of James's first times on a train, as was the case for Matthew. The journey was uneventful, and 3 
	  hours later we arrived in Paddington, where James was absolutely gobsmacked by the size of the station. They don't make 
	  stations like that in Cornwall!
	  <br><br>
	  We then got on the Circle-District line at Paddington, and went 2 stops south to Notting Hill Gate. These are the first 
	  stations to appear on our list of stations, as they were the first ones that we considered to be "ticked off" in line 
          with some system of rules. We then changed to the Central line (which is <em>really</em> far underground at Notting Hill 
	  Gate), and journeyed to Tottenham Court Road. We then walked to the British Museum.
	  <br><br>
	  When we arrived in the museum, we were shocked by the scale of it too - it was vast! We then spent numerous hours 
	  looking around the Roman Britain exhibition in the museum. We were then granted 2 hours to ourselves to explore the 
	  museum, which we spent in the oriental pottery + chinaware section. As it grew dark, we caught a bus back towards 
	  Paddington, as the tube was immensely crowded due to rush-hour. We saw the congestion on Oxford Street due to Christmas 
	  shoppers.
	  <br><br>
	  We arrived back in Paddington to catch the GWR HST home. There was initially some resistance due to some of our reserved 
	  seats being occupied, but after Reading, it was a very uneventful journey home. Matthew alighted at Neath, and James at 
	  Swansea. It was this adventure more than anything else that converted James to love trains and formed the inspiration 
	  for the β series of NT adventures.
