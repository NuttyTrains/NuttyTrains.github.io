    <p> The Alpha adventures were never intended to be Nutty Trains adventures at the time, but in hindsight, they formed the 
	  basis and the inspiration for all our future adventures. The alpha adventures took place when we were both still in 
	  school, as part of school trips. The first, α1, to Bath in December 2015, was James's first experience with trains, 
	  and one of Matthew's first too. The second, α2, was the direct successor to that trip, to London in December 2016.
    </p>
	  <h1> α1: The 1<sup>st</sup> Bath Trip </h1>
	  <p> Back in December 2015, a joint Business Studies & Latin school trip was organised to Bath, for the Latin students 
          to visit the Roman baths, and for the Business students to study the Christmas market. Both groups would then be given 
	  time to explore the city (including Matthew visiting a 5* Indian Restaurant in a dodgy alleyway), before heading home. 
	  However, the real highlight of the trip were the train journeys there and back. 
          <br><br>
          The group met at Swansea train station on that cold December morning, and James was especially excited to be 
	  travelling on his first train, even though he was still a bus addict at the time. Experiencing a GWR HST from Swansea 
	  to Newport was the first step to converting him though! We then changed to a 3-car GWR DMU, which had been fully 
	  reserved, forcing everyone to stand in the corridor all the way to Bath. Along the way, one of our classmates nearly 
	  got decapitated by a passing train whilst sticking his head out of the window. This was going to be a fun trip.
	  <br><br>
	  The Roman baths were optime according to Matthew, whilst James enjoyed the Christmas Market very much. Matthew later 
	  went to a 5* Indian restaurant in a dodgy alleyway, before wandering aimlessly around the city centre. James omitted 
	  the restaurant bit. James was able to explore the shopping centre (this later became a running theme in NT adventures), 
	  whilst Matthew managed to stumble upon Pulteney Bridge, and watched a different classmate threw himself onto the road 
	  in front of a moving bus to retrieve his rugby ball. Despite later adventures consisting of just Matthew and James, we 
	  strive to uphold this level of nuttiness in all our adventures.
	  <br><br>
	  The journey back was less eventful, as night drew in. Once again, we changed at Newport onto a HST, and headed back to 
	  Swansea (Matthew alighting at Neath). This adventure was the earliest precursor to our NT adventures, but it was also 
	  an important component of the foundation of our friendship.</p>
