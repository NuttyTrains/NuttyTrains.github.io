    Welcome to Xi 8, yet another mistaken adventure that we simply do not have the energy for. On the menu today is Reading, Didcot and that bloody line into 
    Oxfor.... wait a fucking minute, this is just a rehash of Xi 7!
    <br><br>
    This was pretty short, just like our energy levels and wills to live.<br>

    <strong>WELCOME TO THE DEEPEST, DARKEST AMNESIA ZONE!</strong>
    <br><br>
    The 9th adventure on this journey is yet another mystery adventure that I have absolutely 0 recollection of - 4th year was fun! Seeing as I did such a good job 
    with the previous mystery, let's keep marching into the void!

So what will the plan be?<br>
Meet me at Paddington, head to Liverpool St and then Colchester?<br>
Or do you have something else in mind
<br><br>
<b>James — 01/12/2022 13:22</b><br>
I’m still pissy about the Oxford Didcot line
<br><br>
<b>Matthew — 01/12/2022 13:23</b><br>
Trust me, so am I<br>
But I am not feeling that at the moment tbh<br>
We could both do with some fresh air<br>
Away from London/Oxford
<br><br>
<b>James — 01/12/2022 13:24</b><br>
Fair, I want to make it to Colchester<br>
I was just saying we do a loop, but it’s a big loop
<br><br>
<b>Matthew — 01/12/2022 13:25</b><br>
I'm afraid I won't have time for a big loop<br>
I'll probably need to wrap up by 6-ish<br>
I still have 2 more weeks in this place xD
<br><br>
<b>James — 01/12/2022 13:25</b><br>
I forget you don’t finish tomorrow
<br><br>
<b>Matthew — 01/12/2022 13:26</b><br>
It is crazy to me that you finish tomorrow
</div>
<p>
    RIP - that conversation explains a lot. As you can see, James had finished for the term and was eager for a big blow-out... and Matthew had 2 more 
    weeks and was getting cold feet about the upcoming Christmas adventure (also in his term-time, but James was leaving for Christmas before Matthew 
    finished). But wait, dear readers.. there is more!

All the UGs are getting kicked out tomorrow<br>
The trains are gonna be fucked<br>
This is a fact I have learnt in the last 30mins
<br><br>
<b>Matthew — 02/12/2022 23:28</b><br>
Hmm yeah, that will fuck your connections out of Oxford<br>
Take your time tomorrow<br>
Just keep me posted
<br><br>
<b>James — 02/12/2022 23:28</b><br>
I probably wont be able to leave until mid afternoon
<br><br>
<b>Matthew — 02/12/2022 23:28</b><br>
Ah I see
<br><br>
<b>James — 02/12/2022 23:29</b><br>
We just had an email from college saying not to bother trying to leave Oxford tomorrow
<br><br>
<b>Matthew — 02/12/2022 23:29</b><br>
Ah
<br><br><br>
<b>James — 03/12/2022 12:22</b><br>
Right, ok<br>
What do. I am probably not going to get in until 3 now<br>
Sorry, I just didn’t sleep very well last night<br>
So what do? Should we still attenpt this?
<br><br>
<b>Matthew — 03/12/2022 12:30</b><br>
Let's not attempt Colchester
<br><br>
<b>James — 03/12/2022 12:31</b><br>
Do you want to come up to Oxford?
<br><br>
<b>Matthew — 03/12/2022 12:32</b><br>
How packed is it there? Are all the trains in the city rammed?
<br><br>
<b>James — 03/12/2022 12:32</b><br>
You’ll be grand<br>
1) you’re coming the wrong way<br>
2) they get kicked out at 10 and so you’ll be fine going back<br>
It’s getting out<br>
I could come down to reading<br>
And we could do some shit there

    And that is basically what happened - as James was essentially stuck in Oxford, Matthew was finally enticed out of London for the first time during term to 
    exotic Reading! I headed to Paddington, took the Swansea train and headed to Reading, whilst James locked themselves out of their house, arrived late to the 
    station and missed their train. Great Success!!
    <br><br>
    Matthew arrived at Reading just after 3, just as James finally managed to leave Oxford. James rocked up to Reading at about half 3 for the NT extravaganza 
    you have all been waiting for!

    And naturally... we went straight to Caffe Nero for over an hour. What exciting kontent! Tune in next week for another riveting episode!!
    <br><br>
    I want to joke now, and do my usual bait-and-switch, but genuinely - look at the videos. Antlers or no, we were shattered. Nothing was happening today. 
    We went to Reading, got on a slow train, and ticked off 4 stations. At Didcot, we had a sit and a chat like old codgers, listened to the beautiful chorus 
    of car alarms and did exactly the same thing - got on a train to Oxford, ticked off 2/3 stations (Fuck you Culham!), and wound up in Oxford.

    We had a nice wander through the city at night, James took me via the maths department and took me to Norham Gardens (now that this is 2024, I can 
    retroactively doxx James), where I met Max for the first time. Then James abandoned me for DnD (they promptly were killed), and I returned to 
    London. And genuinely... that was it. End of adventure. Fin.
    <br><br>
    We interrupt this broadcast for a brief estate agent's tour of Norham Gardens! This is a beautiful, large period property - lots of bedrooms, large kitchen 
    diner out the back (completely unclean - mind the dirty dishes), and as we step inside and head downstairs to the kwality bedroom... <strong>Welcome to 
    the furnace!</strong>
    <br><br>
    Tune in next week for a slightly more exciting adventure - for once, I can actually promise an adventure worth reading...
