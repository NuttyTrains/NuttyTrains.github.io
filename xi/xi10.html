    <strong>...no, they're just Irish</strong>

    James: What if we did the varsity line?<br>
    Matthew: But the varsity line no longer exists?<br>
    James: Bus.
    <br><br>
    ...and thus concludes my write-up of Xi 10. Thank you for listening to my TED talk.
    <br><br>...<br><br>
    Haha, dear reader, you know damn well that Matthew refuses to take buses! This wasn't going to happen! There was <i>no way</i> 
    James was going to convince him to pay for a bus <i>and</i> a train! Especially not when Matthew worked out that National Rail 
    could be scammed... the Oxford-Bedford ticket allowed for 3 unique routings!
    <br><br>
    Things were off to a good start for about 10 minutes. We headed straight to Haddenham & Thame Parkway, <strong>FINALLY</strong> 
    ticking off this station after so many years. To celebrate, James even ran up and down the platform for old times' sake.
    <br><br>
    ...except they didn't need to run. The train remained at the platform. For 10 minutes. Oops - the curse of James had 
    struck yet again. There would be no functioning trains on this adventure either!
    <br><br>
    It turned out that due to a crippled train at High Wycombe, the entire Chiltern network had collapsed. To make it to London at 
    all, we would have to travel down the line to Princes Risborough, reverse to Aylesbury, then reverse again to Marylebone. This 
    was a 2 hour trip, and despite intense plotting and scheming from both of us, there was nothing we could do - we just had to wait. 
    <br><br>
    Well at least that was the last mistake on this adventure!
    <br><br>
    We got to Marylebone and Matthew fancied a walk. He had not been able to fill James' virgin lungs with sufficient carbon monoxide 
    in Southeast London the day before, so a walk through Regents Park was in order. Don't worry, it was only a 'short'<sup>TM</sup> 
    walk! We were basically halfway there already!
    <br><br>
    ...as the reader may already be able to guess, we missed our train. RIP. At least that was the last mistake we'd make on this 
    adventure!
    <br><br>
    Instead, we took a faster train to Leighton Buzzard, skipping out all the stops beyond Watford Junction. This was a real shame, 
    but Matthew claimed that this was in fact all part of his master plan and that he had planned it all along. (It turned out that on 
    our original train, we would have been exceptionally tight for time, and Matthew may have not made it home that evening.) Besides, 
    missing those stops allowed us to make a big day out on the WCML, and a full day in Bletchley Park! James was not quite 
    convinced by Matthew's poor salesmanship skills, but we were both very happy to return to Bletchley Park, if only for 5 minutes. 
    It looks like we <i>will</i> be returning for a day out at some point!
    <br><br>
    But now, it was time for the highlight of the show - the Marston Vale line with their D-trains (converted D78 stock). James had 
    been looking forward to this for years. Imagine their excitement when we stood on the platform... and a sprinter showed up. 
    Yeah, it turns out that Markey has already stolen the D-trains and sent them to Wrexham - a cunning move, given that no-one 
    is willing to risk their life and travel to Wrexham to retrieve them. James was so angry, I thought that it was that curious 
    time of day known to them as 'lunch-time'. 
    <br><br>
    We pulled into Bedford, now with 40 minutes to walk to the town centre and back and get 'lunch'. Bedford; county town of 
    Bedfordshire - should be a lovely day out... right? Right?
    <br><br>
    <strong><i>Insert Vietnam flashbacks here</i></strong>
    <br><br>
    The less said about Bedford, the better. They say a picture says a thousand words, so I will let the below picture speak 
    for itself:

    Thameslink is always fun - riding the world's longest and emptiest trains through miles and miles of endless suburbs and exurbs. 
    This line is particularly interesting, as it passes through Luton Airport, where many curious characters boarded the train - our 
    favourite were the eponymous couple whose conversations inspired this adventure name. Matthew thought they were stoned out of 
    their minds in their hour-long PDA session after they stepped off their flight with no luggage, but James informed him that 
    this was just a cultural misunderstanding... 
    <br><br>
    We took the Lizzie line from Farringdon to Paddington (a lifesaver), and boarded James' chosen train back to Oxford. Problem: 
    it was a Great Malvern train, and it was only 5 carriages. This was going to be a fun hour standing in the vestibule (I say, 
    whilst sitting in the vestibule on my EMR train to London for Koppa 18). Naturally, Matthew amused himself by standing in the 
    chamber between the carriages, staying motionless and waiting for the doors to close on him. This fun game entertained him for at 
    least 45 minutes - the goal was to get trapped:
    <br><br>
    <strong>I'm trapped like a rat!</strong>
    <br><br>
    After 1 hour in the vestibule making kwality kontent, we finally arrived back at Oxford. At least that was the last mistake we'd 
    make on this adventure!
    <br><br>
    Matthew then collected his stuff, collected his 'Pouilly-sur-Loire', and headed back to the station for his super fun journey 
    home. His >5 hour journey home. Oh yeah, <i>this</i> was the biggest mistake of the adventure! A horrific late-night train via 
    Worcestershire Parkway, Birmingham and Derby!
    <br><br>
    The train almost killed Matthew. Fin.
