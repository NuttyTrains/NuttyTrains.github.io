    Welcome one and all to Ξ6, the depression adventure! The sordid details of this adventure will likely never see the light of day.
    <br><br>
    Join us as we relive some of our greatest hits - Birmingham, Shrewsbury, Markey, Oxford, and oh God no, crippling depression
    -------------
    <br><br>
    <strong>WELCOME BACK TO THE AMNESIA ZONE!</strong>
    <br><br>
    As Matthew embarks upon the 3rd tranche of his archaeological dig, we reach an adventure that really ought to have been lost to the 
    midsts of time - Xi 6. If this poor reconstruction of trauma remains unfinished, then know that I died doing what I hated.

    At NT, we have a policy of endorsing dark humour - read any of our previous accounts for proof. Further, I have been including 
    certain spicy Discord conversations to fill gaps in my memory as I continue my amnesia quest. I will not be doing that here; this 
    adventure is genuinely quite bad - James had just had a night to forget, and Matthew was quite frankly spiralling at a rapidly 
    increasing velocity - hence, the spicy quotes are for once genuinely too spicy, even for this cursed website. We'll stick to 
    the adventure here, and be glad that it is over - the adventure, that period of our lives, and our Birmingham trips (for now).

    We started in Oxford at about lunchtime, and headed to Leamington Spa. Here we changed to Coventry, which is certainly a station 
    of all time (we have both since visited Coventry - it is a city of all time). We took a train via Birmingham International 
    and headed straight to Birmingham New St. As this was Birmingham, and we were both depressed that day, we did not appreciate 
    this very much. We elected to immediately leave Birmingham and head south (once again, our glorious friend TB ignored this and 
    sent us on a jolly to Crewe).

    We took the line all the way south to Redditch, missing Bromsgrove entirely, before having 10 minutes in the station car park, 
    too afraid to leave, lest we had to interact with the locals, before getting back on the train and returning up the line. 
    Unfortunately, as we missed Bromsgrove, and because they are busily constructing a second line in this direction (via Pineapple 
    Road), we will one day have to return here. This is much to Matthew's chagrin, as he is a very poor PhD candidate (relative to 
    James), who now is the one who lives in the middle of nowhere... this means that a Birmingham trip necessitates a long and 
    expensive trip, just to meet up in some dump. NT was much more fun when living in London. Still, at least we got to see Bournville 
    (the site of the Cadbury factory).

    Unfortunately, we had found ourselves back in Birmingham once more. Birmingham? On a Birmingham adventure? Disgusting. This would 
    have to be corrected... what if we headed to Markeyland instead? For once, Matthew acquiesced - even Markeyland had to be better 
    than <i>Birmingham</i>. Just look that that face: is that a face that is happy to be in Birmingham? (Is that a face that is happy 
    to be alive??)

    In no time at all, we were zipping out towards Wolverhampton - glorious Wolverhampton. I say 'zipped' - we were on a slow train. 
    This just have us even more time to admire the post-industrial hellscape as we pulled into the city. Needless to say, we were 
    very pleased when our actual fast train turned up, and we actually zipped almost straight to Shrewsbury... ON A MARKEY TRAIN!! 
    It felt very good to be back on a Markey train. We love Markey very much. Our brain chips flooded our brains with oxytocin in 
    increasing concentrations as we approached the Welsh border. Markey was welcoming us home!
    <br><br>
    <strong>The brain chip only activates when your cross the severn bridge</strong><br>
    <strong>My mother said, 'oooh Jamie you have to eat a faggot.', I think I took that too literally.</strong><br>
    <strong>Outsourcing my emotions to the Markey brain chip.</strong>

    We disembarked at Shrewsbury to have a look around the town, given that the last time we were here, we managed to see nothing but 
    the multistorey car park and the Subway. This time we saw a little more - it was actually not so bad. Naturally, we spent most 
    of the time putting on squeaky voices, to pay homage to another aspiring Ffynone videographer (I have forgotten his name - James: 
    help plz).
    <br><br>
    But then, we made Markey sad. We made Markey angry. We would not be coming home. We were returning to Birmingham.
    <br><br>
    Apart from a hilarious clip where Matthew jammed his hand in the door twice (which is likely to be the only Xi 6 video that ever 
    sees the light of day), this is where things became darker. I want to blame Markey's brain chip, but in reality, neither of us 
    were well, and Matthew was especially unwell. This was the adventure where James realised exactly how unwell Matthew really 
    was. Things were not good. The amnesia zone exists for a reason. The spiciest quotes will not be repeated here (I have wiped 
    most from my memory), so instead, I leave you with some hilarious quotes and a gorgeous photo. Writing in 2024, I am very glad 
    that we are both out of this now.
