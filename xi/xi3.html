    Who ever heard of dividing the country up neatly into adventure classes? Let's have a Xi adventure starting in London this time!
    And just when you thought NT had survived a reckoning with our past on Xi 1, it is time for round 2: Cambridge time! Will James be hungover? Will 
    Matthew have a mental breakdown? Will Thameslink commit the not alive? Find out in Xi 3!
    <br><br>
    Odds on James not having a mental breakdown: 2-1<br>
    Odds on Matthew not offing himself: 3-1<br>
    Odds on us doing shitty stuff purely for the Youtube algorithm: Keep hold of your money, that is 100% happening and you know it!
    <br><br>
    This adventure actually starts the previous night, when James turned up drunk as a rat to Matthew's house in Kensal, bloody barely standing. He wandered in 
    drunkenly, almost wanting to vomit after he had ingested twice the lethal dosage of ethanol at Usman's party in South Ken. Oh and his nails were painted. 
    Over the course of the next few hours, James was absolutely on fire: enjoy some of his best ones (and one from Matthew):
    <br><br>
    <strong>"Well I'm pan, so 'nice cock'!"<br>
    "I loves a bit of racism"<br>
    "I love Thatcher's hairstyle - best thing about her"<br>
    "What degree do you do again, you filthy art student?"<br>
    "You should be shot"<br>
    "Ah you are one of the normal ones who eats meat"<br>
    "Ah yes, getting you drunk out of your mind and having sex with you without your consent - a true sign of a loving relationship!"<br>
    "Well she was hot! She had red hair!"</strong>
    <br><br>
    After spending 2 hours being brutally offensive and just generally drunk out his mind whilst talking to Matthew and his housemate Max, James eventually started 
    to sober up, but only enough to play some art student bingo with Max, quote Borat back and forth with Max, and ridicule Matthew's stir fry, before falling asleep 
    on Matthew's floor and starting to snore. With that, Matthew ushered James downstairs and into bed.

    The next morning was rough. Rough as hell. Especially as the extremely hungover James was rudely awoken by Freya's alarm clock at 7am.
    <br><br>
    But you know who was having a rougher morning? Thameslink. Whilst we were planning our course of action in the morning, we noticed something strikingly familiar 
    about James' visits to London - literally every service out towards Cambridge was completely fucking dead. Thameslink had offed itself.

    Thameslink wasn't alone. As we arrived at Kensal Green tube station, the Bakerloo had offed itself too, so we ticked off the Overloo into Euston - tick! There goes 
    our lovely Koppa-only TfL table! Who needs clean divisions anyway?
    <br><br>
    We walked to St Pancras and bought Greggs for breakfast, as James was dying of hunger and being hungover, laughing at the French people leaving the Eurostar. We then 
    changed to Kings Cross and just caught the 1st operational Thameslink train of the day towards Cambridge, stopping at many interesting places. Unfortunately, we had no 
    cameras for this section of the trip, so the video you will see for this adventure will be decidedly old school - PHONE TIME!
    <br><br>
    There are a few pretty stations on the way, with Potters Bar having its own Sainsbury's, Shepreth having its own zoo, and Welwyn Garden Tesco having its own station. 
    We initially went through tunnel after tunnel after tunnel, before the land became flatter and flatter. The countryside was very pretty on the way up. We ought to do 
    more countryside adventures, especially ones leaving London termini.

    We arrived in Cambridge at about 2, and headed straight for Catz, where James was staying. James then decided to choke on some hard Cambridge water, Matthew ate some 
    plain white bread, and James' cameras had a few spasms as we watched our new video, which you should too if you are sad enough to read this.
    <br><br>
    We then set out to explore Cambridge, passing the biggest. poshest, most touristy colleges first, followed by lovely little Trinity Hall. We then headed over to 
    Jacks Gelato, which must be laced with a few milliDruths of cwac, because James is addicted and can often be found 
    pawing at the glass window of the shop at 11pm at night, waiting for his 10th ice cream of the day. From this moment on, forget the city, forget the uni, forget the 
    colleges, and even forget Part III - the real reason James is applying to Cambridge is Jack's Gelato! You heard it here first.
    <br><br>
    We walked up out of the city centre, past Magdalen, and climbed all the way to the top of Castle Mound, where we admired the view for a bit, before filming some crap 
    on the way down, including an excellent Tom Scott parody - SINGLE TAKE!

<p>
    We passed the touristy street (St Johns, Trinity, Kings and the Corpus Christi clock), popped back into Catz briefly, then headed out to Selwyn to admire it for a 
    bit (whilst also complaining about Grange Road). Hopefully James will be back in Cambridge when Ed Miliband eats a bacon sarnie live in front of an audience, so that 
    we can watch some quality entertainment when we are there next!
    <br><br>
    We walked back up Silver Street, then doubled down Mill Lane towards the river to admire it in the twilight. It was very very pretty. We both liked it a lot. James was 
    enormously tempted by seeing Darwin College's library protrude out over the river, glistening in the fading sunlight. He liked seeing that a lot. James 
    also really liked seeing REDACTED and rubbing it in.
    <br><br>
    We then wandered around 3 sites in succession - Mill Lane, New Museums and Downing, as Matthew attempted to find a particular building that he liked (it was Downing 
    site), and James straight up broke into a lecture hall. I bet that everyone was <i>very</i> impressed by that!
    <br><br>
    Finally, we reached Emmanuel College, and wandered around the perimeter to heal Matthew's battle scars, whilst James did the same at Christs by laughing at them 
    loudly and publicly. We skirted around the back of the bus station after finding that our chosen curry house was closed (RIP), avoided the giant queue at Zizzi's, 
    and noticed Bella Italia was closed, so we went to Bryon Burger instead, and grossly abused the promise of "bottomless fries". 
    <br><br>
    <strong>"Do you ever eat so much meat that you get the meat sweats?"</strong>
    <br><br>
    Finally, we paid and returned to Catz to rest our weary legs and backs. After roughly an hour, we headed out once more towards the station, with James turning back 
    about halfway. Matthew <s><i>stole</i></s> "borrowed" James' bike in a completely non-dodgy way (whacking the lock until it loosened), before boarding the train.
    <br><br>
    But yet again, the trains were fucked, so the conductor <i>advised</i> that we gave up and went to Liverpool St instead... which is what Matthew did. The journey down 
    was initially fine, but as we penetrated deeper into Essex, more eponymous inhabitants of the county started to board the train and congregate in the carriage, all 
    drunk out of their minds and belching like chimneys. They appeared to have a wretching contest, a few might have vomited, one guy started punching the ceiling of 
    the train to try and create a hole, and a boy and a girl had a screaming match after she stood up instead of, and I quote, "sitting on my penis". James was right - 
    the nuttiest shit <i>does</i> happen on the journey back!
    <br><br>
    Speaking of James, he had had his own interesting journey back. Very interesting indeed. But because I am a bastard, I will relay none of this here and force to 
    to watch the Koppa 7 video, because that is clearly the logical place for something that happened on Xi 3. Like and subscribe plebs. Like and subscribe.
    <br><br>
    <i>Many traumatising exchanges from the Essex boys and girls behind him:</i>
    <br><br>
    Matthew left Liverpool St only to find the entire population of Essex was present, so very quickly legged it down the street, threw himself onto the saddle, and pedalled 
    for his life - equally true when a bus tried to run him over. Eventually though, he reached Euston and home without further incidents, putting an end to NT for a full 10 
    hours, before it all started back up again :). Read on for Koppa 7!
