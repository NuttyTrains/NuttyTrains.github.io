    A bottle of wine on the Elizabeth line - it was Henley time. Tune in for our countryside adventure to the bucolic rural towns of Henley, Heathrow 
    and Marlow, where we get pissed, run through a field of wheat with Terry May, and meet the Queen.

    <strong>WELCOME TO THE AMNESIA ZONE!</strong>
    <br><br>
    Here, Matthew will now embark upon an archaeological dig through the past 2 years of content that may or may not have been lost to the mists of time. 
    Who knows what horrific secrets await him, as he attempts to badly reconstruct the traumas of 2022/23... it only gets worse from here onwards! 
    As you can tell from the title... James is about to embark upon the journey of their lifetime...

    Oh fuck me<br>
    I am underdressed<br>
    Fucking hell its all the old Oxford boys in their jackets and colours<br>>
    We need to do a cornishmans guide to henley regatta, it'd be so fucking funny<br>>
    This puts my RP to shame<br>
    I didnt think this sort of thing actually existed<br>
    Truro School was something, but this is something else.</div>

    James' morning could not have looked more different to Matthew's evening if they tried... well, apart from the copious quantity of 
    alcohol present (not consumed - Matthew hadn't yet started his alcoholism arc). You see, James was headed to Henley-on-Thames on 
    the day of the regatta... for a hash. That's right, on the day that the regatta was out on full display, but a few months before 
    they actually started in Oxford... James was going to get drunk in some field with some old codgers. Cue 2022 Matthew shaking his 
    head in disapproval - or rather, Matthew <i>would</i> have shaken his head in disapproval, had he been aware of this - he was not. 
    Matthew erroneously assumed that James <i>was</i> visiting the regatta, and so dressed accordingly (see below). You, dear reader, 
    can imagine Matthew's level of disapproval when he rocked up in Henley, dressed in a shirt and tie, to find an extremely sozzled 
    James with no idea where he was or where we were going... ie, the perfect condition for a day on the trains!
    <br><br>
    Back then we still had ambition, so the plan was to try to tick off every branch line in the Thames valley... despite for some 
    reason starting the day at 17:30. Presumably this was because James was busy drinking until then, and Matthew was busy sleeping. 
    The reason is probably lost to time, over 2 years later. Nonetheless, Matthew dragged the swaying James back to the station, 
    shoved them onto the first train, promptly missed the first stop (rip) and we were away!
    <br><br>
    The first branch line on the menu was the Henley branch, which we mostly ticked off, before arriving at Twyford. The entire 
    English upper class was in attendance at Henley that Sunday, but in Henley they had an entire town to spread out within. At 
    Twyford station, they had only 2 platforms, meaning that Twyford station had arguably the densest concentration of the English 
    upper class of any location in the world... and we were there too, I guess. Fortunately for us, we decided to avoid the crowds 
    and head immediately east, 1 stop down the line to Terry May town - Maidenhead.
    <br><br>
    At Maidenhead we proceeded to head back up the Thames valley to a second branch line - Marlow. Marlow was actually quite a pretty 
    station, but naturally I don't possess any photos because this is NT, and we only take photos of shit places. Ask ChatGPT or 
    something. After a 10 minute stop, we headed back down the line.

    Readers of a certain age may remember that our very naughty PM, Terry May, once ran through a field of wheat. To celebrate our 
    arrival in her home constituency of Maidenhead, we decided we could also be naughty. We were unable to find any suitably close 
    fields of wheat (it was already getting late), so we decided to get drunk on the Elizabeth line instead... maybe Matthew's 
    alcoholism arc was just about beginning? We bought some horrific £4 wine from the Sainsburys Local near the station - <i>how</i> 
    we managed to choke that down, I do not understand.
    <br><br>
    Nevertheless, the show continued - it was onto the final branchline, to beautiful Windsor... which unfortunately meant changing 
    at *shudders* <i>Slough</i>. 
    <br><br>
    <strong><i>Come friendly bombs, rain on Slough,<br>
    there's nothing here for humans now<br></i>I

    <br><br>
    Don't worry though, my fine friends - there will be plenty more Slough in the next adventure!

    Fuck me<br>
    Thus train is misersble
    <br><br>
    <b>Matthew — 04/07/2022 00:44</b><br>
    I can top that<br>
    The Bakerloo train was held in Marylebone for 10 minutes, because some m*** was trapped in the tunnel between Marylebone and Baker Street<br>
    On the tracks<br>
    So then we went at walking pace between the 2<br>
    And then the train pulled into the wrong platform at Queens Park
    <br><br>
    <b>James — 04/07/2022 01:49</b><br>
    Oh no, what a shame 10 minutes eheu whatever will you do
