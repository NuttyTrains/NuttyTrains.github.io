    Here's an idea - why don't we go halfway across the country on shitty stopping services with angry conductors and attempt to be abandoned? Oh and let's 
    start in the middle of the evening!
    <br><br>
    Matthew caught the train from MYB to Oxford, whilst TweetyBoi actually worked for the first time ever (mostly), and met James at Oxford station. We walked over 
    to Teddy Hall, pissed about in James' room for a bit then went to meet Usman down by the Isis. After waiting for half an hour he turned up and we went punting – James 
    first, Usman second and Matthew last. James caused many, many crashes along the way, but Matthew seemed rather good for a beginner. Best NT activity ever! 
    <br><br>
    We went to Moomoo and had smoothies, then waited in Teddy Hall for a bit, before running in just 10 minutes across the entire city to catch the once-a-day train to MIM. 
    Almost died as a result. Matthew looked like he had seen death. Ticked off a few picturesque stations before being given a bollocking by the conductor, so invoked the 
    ‘angry conductor’ rule and stayed onboard for the rest of the halts. We visited MIM Co-op, then caught the next train to Great Malvern via Wozza, filming all the way. 
    Filmed more stuff at Great Malvern then caught the train to Hereford. Met Matthew's uncle Nick and and his grandmother in Hereford station, then drove off. We waited 
    ages for fish and chips, then went back to Matthew's uncle's house to eat them. Met Matthew's aunt Sarah and Nelson the dog who growled when he was happy. We had a 
    nice meal, before flooring it back to the station. Caught the train back, and saw a TfW train on the way!
    <br><br>
    We had a very long conversation on the way back, before transferring to the RRB at Wozza. We had it mostly to ourselves, so ranted about politics for 2 hours - fun. 
    #RRBTime! We showed up in to Oxford at half past midnight, and Matthew cycled around Oxford with a camera for 25 minutes in the pouring rain, whilst James hopped 
    from shelter to shelter - NT Smooth Jazz will be coming soon! We went back to James' room, made up the second bed for Matthew, then talked about Ffynone until stupid 
    o’clock in the morning. Woke up tired. 
    <br><br>
    We had breakfast then headed out to the station, but missed the train by but a few seconds, so instead hopped back to Teddy Hall again. Matthew went to the Queens Lane 
    Café (oldest in Europe) and had Turkish Coffee, Turkish Delight and a Bagel, before meeting James, crossing the street and going to the Grand Café (Iacobus Iudaecus) 
    for cream tea. Vey nice. 
    <br><br>
    We went to Teddy Hall once more, before walking back to the station yet again to try and tick off Islip, and finally succeeded. We walked around Bicester Village itself, 
    got absolutely drenched and attempted to recreate the Xi 1 clip. We returned to the station, filmed more shit (including NT-phile), then went back to Oxford and Teddy 
    Hall for the last time. Matthew collected his stuff and James' bike, then cycled off to Oxford station. He caught the train back to MYB and cycled home (~23 mins).
