<p>
    Here's an idea - why don't we go halfway across the country on shitty stopping services with angry conductors and attempt to be abandoned? Oh and let's 
    start in the middle of the evening!
    <br><br>
    It was time to head back to Oxford! We'd been planning this adventure for quite a while as the first segment of "The Summer of NT"/"How can James transport 
    all his worldly belongings from Oxford to London to Cambridge and back again". Moreover, thanks to Matthew's brilliant planning, this was to be the first multi-day 
    non-Koppa adventure, so it looked very promising!
    <br><br>
    Matthew caught the train from MYB to Oxford, which was a very nice train - basically every single seat had a table. Noice. James had been fiddling with 
    TweetyBoi 2.0, yet for the first time in his life, it was TweetyBoi 1.0 who came to the rescue and actually worked for the first time ever (mostly):

<p>
    Matthew also did a little bit of filming on the way up (but cocked it up), which you may see in the Xi 2 video. After just over an hour, he met James at Oxford station. 
    We walked over through the city to James' room at Teddy Hall for one of the last nights ever. James had been there for a month at this point, so it was a home away 
    from home... but not for much longer! We pissed about in his room for a while, drinking tea and eating fruit. Matthew also had a decent tour of James' kitchen, 
    including the fire safety poster. I am going to baptise this the "fractal poster", because the deeper you looked, the more things you found wrong with it. First of all, 
    it was in Oxford, yet it was a poster released by the East Sussex Fire Service. How? How is that possible? But then looking deeper, the student in the text exchange on the 
    poster said "Ta x", indicating that they are clearly Welsh. Again, why? What would a Welsh student be doing in England? Markey would never let them leave! 
    <br><br>
    However, having both escaped the clutches of Markey, here we were. After staying in James' room a little longer, we heading down to the Isis at Magdalen College to 
    meet James' friend Usman from the Oxford Summer School.
    <br><br>
    Matthew quickly learned that Usman is a kindred spirit to him - perennially late to everything, and with a concept of time more warped than any other complex manifold 
    James has yet studied. In true Matthew spirit, Usman rocked up half an hour late. In the meantime, we had been waiting down on the slipway into the river. We had watched 
    the small queue of people dissipate, but were then shocked to find a summer school group show up, 40 or 50-strong. Oh fuck, this was bad. This was very very bad. As they'd 
    say in Camborne, <i>"O'oh Arrgh, woz 'appenin' me cock? Arrgh, th'rl n't be no p'nts dreckly!"</i>.
    <br><br>
    Fortunately, being a large group of horny teenagers, corralling them into groups of 4 and getting them on boats took an absolute age. For about 20 minutes, they were 
    unable to divide into 4s - "We can do a 3 and a 5!". Now those are <i>definitely</i> Oxford material! So when Usman showed up, we just slipped into the queue of year 12s, 
    aiming to blend in, and when we were spotted, we merely said "We were already queueing" (not entirely false), and were waved through! Vey nice!
    <br><br>
    After they nicked the boat that had been assigned to us, we got on a new one, whereby James assigned himself the role of Captain, before running to the end 
    of the boat and grabbing the long metal pole. Usman boarded the near end, and took the oar, and Matthew thus got into the middle of the boat, crossing his fingers 
    that he wouldn't end up in the river within the next hour.
    <br><br>
    James tried his best though. No sooner had we reversed out of our moorings, we then immediately crashed straight into the side of another boat. What a great start. We then 
    crashed into the bridge, into the same boat again, into another boat, into some parked boats, into a 3rd boat, before causing a massive pile-up in the river. Yay! 
    We love being public nuisances here at NT! James was clearly just embracing his inner Cornish seaman - as they'd say in 'Zance, <i>"Ooh Arrgh Ci'y Boi! Ain't no 
    trrraff'c j'ms out sea!"</i>. So naturally, James adopted the tried and tested method of <strong>"SPEED AND POWERRRRR!"</strong> to get us through. Oh God. This 
    entire section is on camera, which James will edit into a Youtube video, so you can experience this LIVE in 4D for but a small fee (impeding sense of doom not included 
    in the price).
</p>

<p>
    We continued down the river, past Magdalen College itself, continuing to cause crashes with other orthogonal boats, and spending most of the time scraping violently along 
    the river bank, determined to destroy as much as possible. See, when Menna taught us about erosion back in Ffynone, she taught us that there were 4 processes of 
    erosion - Attrition, Abrasion, Solution and Hydraulic Action. But after Xi 2, I can confirm that Menna neglected to tell us about the 5th process - James.
    <br><br>
    Meanwhile, whilst we were busy fearing for our lives, Matthew and Usman were busy talking, filming an unboxing video, and listening to classical guitar music whilst being 
    "steered" down the river. Enjoy these timeless quotes:
    <br><br>
    <strong>
    James! 2 orthogonal vectors straight ahead!<br>
    Welcome to my unboxing, please like and subscribe<br>
    They didn't call Erdos an all-rounder for nothing - some fluid dynamics in the morning, some boxing in the afternoon, some Lie Groups in the evening!<br>
    Oi, that's just my dissertation!
    </strong>
    <br><br>
    At the bottom of the stretch of river, we all switched places - Matthew took the oar, Usman took the pole, and James lay there in the middle, sunning himself 
    and enjoying the look of pain and fear in Matthew and Usman's eyes after having endured half an hour of crashes. Usman took us around the bend in the river and onto 
    the next straight, and our crash rate immediately plummeted to almost 0. Hmm, I wonder why. With Usman on the back of the boat, this reminded James of the Oxford 
    Summer School. Great Success!
    <br><br>
    Matthew meanwhile enjoyed being in charge of the oar, and so when we switched again at the end of that strait, Matthew took the back of the boat for the first time. 
    This has to have been one of his favourite NT experiences of all time - punting down the ISIS. It was really glorious. Matthew listened to Usman's advice about using 
    the pole like a rudder, and ignored all of James' advice, and thus didn't crash once (we had a close call with a low hanging branch, but that was it), even managing to 
    moor the boat! We disembarked and then walked up back to Teddy Hall for Matthew to collect some stuff, before heading to the covered market.
    <br><br>
    All 3 of us then went to Moomoo and had smoothies, which were honestly delicious. We didn't know we needed them, but we absolutely did. After this, we said our 
    goodbyes to Usman, and headed back to Teddy Hall once more.
    <br><br>
    <strong>That's dummy thicc</strong>
    <br><br>
    We waited in Teddy Hall for a bit. And by 'a bit', I mean 'a bit too long'. Before we knew it, we had only about 15 minutes to get to the station on the other side 
    of the city... and one of us would have to go on foot. Matthew tried to make a break for it, but was thwarted by his lack of a key for the front gate to the college. 
    Bugger. He waited for James to come, who unlocked the gate for him, and went to collect his bike, whilst Matthew shot off like a rocket, sprinting down Queens Lane 
    towards the Ashmolean. Matthew ran continuously all the way to the gates of Trinity College before running out of breath, collapsing and dying. James then overtook 
    Matthew's corpse, before getting stuck at a traffic light and being overtaken by Matthew again, who was back to sprinting. Matthew then kept sprinting all the way to 
    the business school, when his heart gave up on him and he was forced to walk. James meanwhile had struck a huge queue of traffic, so overtook them all by cycling down 
    the middle of the road, almost becoming a pancake in the process. He then 'locked' his bike outside the business school, and ran after Matthew.
    <br><br>
    Matthew crawled up the ramp to the station, his arteries about to explode from his blood pressure. He looked up at the dot matrices to see that, OH MY GOD, the dot 
    matrix was kill. Every single pixel was having a fucking spasm. It was worse than the blue screen of death. Even worse, the <i>only</i> fucked dot matrix was the one 
    for our train. All the rest were functioning perfectly. Matthew glanced around furtively, looking for data to absorb (like Zuckerberg), before eventually finding the 
    platform - PLATFORM 4! Quick! Go!<br>
    ...<br> 
    Except he couldn't. James wasn't there! No!
    <br><br>
    James then came sprinting in, asking which platform it was. Matthew told him, then sprinted through the barriers, only to find that James had yet to buy tickets. Is 
    this how our adventure ends? Stuck at the ticket barrier because we had left the tickets to the last minute? Matthew couldn't bear to look, and so sprinted across to 
    platform 4 anyway, hoping James would follow.
    <br><br>
    Matthew reached the platform, leaned forwards against a metal pillar, and promptly fainted from exhaustion. The End. I hope you enjoyed this adventure.
    <br><br><br><br>
    But wait! James then came sprinting across the bridge, descending to the platform and asking "Have we missed it?". To any onlooker, this might have seemed the case, 
    but no! The train was delayed by just enough for James to make it! It pulled into the platform and we jumped aboard before melting into the nearest seats, dead.
    <br><br>
    The entire ordeal had taken 10 minutes exactly, from Teddy Hall to the ticket barrier. And they were the toughest 10 minutes of our lives. Let us never, ever do that again! 
    <br><br>
    Matthew looked like a corpse, and so took a few minutes to recover. He looked as if he had seen the afterlife, but it was all worth it - we had caught the once a day 
    train to Moreton-in-Marsh, stopping at every single tiny little station in the middle of nowhere!
    <br><br>
    We got the camera equipment out, and started filming. We soon started jumping on and off when we reached the quiet, picturesque country halts. We ticked off 
    Combe, which Matthew was very enamoured by (it was just a platform in the middle of a field), and Finstock (which James was very pleased about - it is the least used 
    station in Oxfordshire - TICK!). We then passed Charlbury, right next to Jeremy Clarkson's Farm. At this station, James ran all the way down the length of the platform 
    to catch the station sign, before running all the way back to the doors that he started at, looking like an absolute madman in the process. And this was where the 
    problem started. 
    <br><br>
    There we were, just starting to film an NT update, when the conductor came over and gave us an absolute bollocking. This was even worse than the Heart of Wales line - 
    at least he had just stopped us from disembarking - this conductor outright told us that he intended to leave us behind if we disembarked again. To make matters 
    worse, as this was the only train of the day, if we got abandoned, we were absolutely screwed. We looked sheepish, nodded, and sat down. A rethink was in order.
</p>
<ol>
    <li> Hence, we came up with the Angry Conductor Clause, which can henceforth be invoked where applicable:
        <ul> 
          <li> This allows us to neglect stepping down onto the platform. </li>
          <li> The station can be ticked off as visited provided that the doors open at the station, even if we did not open them ourselves. </li>
          <li> If there are no passengers dis/embarking, we must open the doors ourselves </li>
          <li> We must still take a photograph/video of the station sign </li>
        </ul>
     </li>
</ol>
<p>
    With this rule change under our belt, we continued, at a far more subdued pace than before. At Ascott (which James thought was Royal Ascot), we 
    realised why he was angry - the doors were open for a mere 10 seconds before closing. We were clearly very late. Hence, from now on, we stayed 
    firmly on the train, and filmed out of the window and/or open doors.
    <br><br>
    Before long, we arrived at the terminus in Moreton-in-Marsh (MIM), which, true to what it says on the tin, is definitely in a marsh. We had a few minutes to kill, so 
    we visited the (very posh) Co-op and did some filming whilst we awaited Train #2!
</p>
<center><img width="55%" src="../resources/photos/MIM.JPG"></center>
<p>
    Our train then arrived, and we settled in for the journey to Great Malvern via Wozza, filming all the way. We started up TweetyBoi again, to... questionable effect. 
    Still a little shaken by our brush with Simon, the angry conductor, we continued with the angry conductor clause, and remained on the train. 
    <br><br>
    Having said that, it probably wasn't necessary. As soon as we entered the territory of West Midlands Railway, all the staff were enormously friendly and helpful. They 
    even encouraged James to leap off at Wozza Foregate Street to film the old semaphore signals. WMR - hats off to you!
    <br><br>
    We also passed the brand new Wozza Parkway station, which looked absolutely fantastic. It struck Matthew as quite odd that no-one had thought to build it before - it is 
    in a very useful location! We will definitely be going back at some point to give our many viewers the lowdown on the station when we change at Wozza Parkway for a future 
    trip to REDACTED.

    We left Wozza, passed a magnificent sign at Malvern Link (but missed it, twice), then terminated at Great Malvern. We wandered around the vicinity of the station, filming 
    plenty more crap (and also a girls' school, at James' insistence), as well as Geoff and Jago parodies: coming soon to your favourite and mine - the NT Youtube channel! 
    <br><br>
    Our third train west then arrived, and we caught it to Hereford. After some mild confusion with carriages on Matthew's behalf, we were shortly passing through the 
    rolling cider orchards of Herefordshire. This made James feel incredibly thirsty. He hadn't had a drink in almost 24 hours! Unacceptable! In all fairness though, it 
    is a very pretty part of the world, just like everywhere we seem to go on Xi adventures. By half 8, we were pulling into Hereford: TfW territory! James' eyes welled up 
    with tears, now that he was so close to his Lord and saviour Markey. James loves Markey. <i>James Bluddween Markey.</i>

<p>
    We exited the station, and met Matthew's uncle, Nick and and his grandmother, waiting for us by the exit. We drove off into the town centre, managing in just a few 
    seconds to see more of Hereford than we had managed on Sampi 3. We pulled up outside a fish and chip shop, and Nick went in to get food, whilst Matthew's Grandma got 
    to know James a little better. We ended up having to wait ages for some reason, almost as if the shop had forgotten to cook any in advance! (I shouldn't complain though - 
    they were very nice). We spent a while pointing and laughing at art students before heading back to Nick's house for dinner, where we met Matthew's aunt, Sarah and 
    Nelson the dog who growled when he was happy, just like Scott did. Resquiscet in Pace. 
    <br><br>
    We had a nice meal there, and a nice catch-up, before we set off back to the station, again with just 10 minutes to go. Fortunately for us, we had a car this time, so 
    Matthew's heart could remain intact for another beating some other day. We floored it back to the station, boarded the train, said our goodbyes and set off, back to Oxford!
    We even saw a TfW train leaving just before us, bringing a tear to our eyes.

    We had a very long conversation on the way back, before transferring to the RRB at Wozza. This was NT's first ever RRB, and we can tell you exclusively that GWR did not 
    skimp on their Rail Replacement Bus - it was a fucking coach! And this is a pretty exclusive take, because we had it mostly to ourselves - there were only 4 passengers 
    on the entire coach! We settled into the back of the bus and started ranting about politics for 2 hours (fun). #RRBTime!

    We showed up in to Oxford at half past midnight, to find what was initially a light mizzle, but later a full-blown shower. Matthew asked to try out the bike (which was 
    miraculuously still there after all this time), and promptly cycled around Oxford one-handedly, with a camera in the other hand, for 25 minutes in the pouring rain. 
    Matthew had not intended to cycle for this long, but what he didn't realise is that James was hopping from shelter to shelter the whole time, elongating the journey, and 
    Matthew's lack of dryness, by a factor of 3. Nonetheless, the video is *chefs kiss" - see NT Smooth Jazz below! 
    <br><br>
    By this point, James was very wet, and Matthew was absolutely soaked to the skin: so wet, that his clothes were sticking to him, and had changed colour! 
    We went back to James' room, and made up the second bed for Matthew. We got into bed at 2, then talked about Ffynone until stupid o’clock in the morning. Woke up tired.

<p>
    Thank you Past James - it was time for Day 2! We woke up, had breakfast, then headed out to the station to try and tick off Islip - the Gilfach Fargoed of Xi. Matthew was 
    once again walking, but this time set off early enough to even buy James a ticket before he arrived. Unfortunately, James hit every single red light on the bike, so arrived 
    at the station with just seconds to spare. We legged it through the ticket barriers and down the platform, but the conductor shook his head, and we watched the train pull off 
    forlornly. We had missed the train by but a few seconds. RIP. Plans: screwed. Condition: hopeless. Weather: wet.
    <br><br>
    We instead hopped back to Teddy Hall again, from shelter to shelter, avoiding the rain. Along the way, a crackhead on a bike passed us - one with black hair, one with red, 
    walking through Oxford. So enjoy this quote:
    <br><br>
    <strong>Hey there Harry Potter, what's up?</strong>
    <br><br>
    James had a meeting immenently, so Matthew fucked off to the Queens Lane Café (the oldest in Europe) and had Turkish Coffee, Turkish Delight and a Bagel, before meeting James 
    after his meeting. We got soaked in the rain, then crossed the street and went to the Grand Café, which <i>also</i> claimed to be the oldest cafe in Europe. We had cream tea - 
    #JamFirst. Vey Nice!
    <br><br>
    <strong>Iacobus Iudaeus</strong>
    <br><br>
    We waited for a break in the rain, then returned to Teddy Hall once more, before walking back to the station yet again to try and tick off Islip. This was <i>not</i> going to be 
    the Gilfach Fargoed of Xi - we were going to make this!
    <br><br>
    And at last! Islip - TICK! WE finally succeeded!
    <br><br>
    We then arrived at the next station, Bicester Village, and decided to this time walk around the Village itself, after managing to film the Chinese station announcement: 
    <strong>买！买！买!</strong>
    <br><br>
    Bicester Village is basically a large version of MacArthur Glen, with luxury brands and a plethora of Chinese tourists (indeed, it is the second most popular tourist 
    attraction for them in Britain, behind only Buckingham Palace). We got absolutely drenched as the rain turned itself up to 11, and then turned back when Matthew's shoe 
    decided that life wasn't worth living, and started letting water in. There is a 10/10 clip where Matthew talks about his underwear in the video, in the pissing rain: 
    coming soon!

    We attempted to recreate the Xi 1 clip on the way back to the station, and avoid copyright claims whilst doing so (by whistling). Noice! We returned to the station, 
    drenched as rats, filmed more shit (including NT-phile), then went back to Oxford and Teddy Hall for the last time. Matthew collected his stuff and James' bike, then 
    cycled off to Oxford station. The first stage of the "Transporting James' worldly possessions halfway across the country and back" plan was now almost complete - 
    Matthew caught the train back to MYB, sitting on the floor, next to the bike, before cycling home (~23 mins), ready for phase 2: Koppa 6.
