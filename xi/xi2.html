    Here's an idea - why don't we go halfway across the country on shitty stopping services with angry conductors and attempt to be abandoned? Oh and let's 
    start in the middle of the evening!
    <br><br>
    It was time to head back to Oxford! We'd been planning this adventure for quite a while as the first segment of "The Summer of NT"/"How can James transport 
    all his worldly belongings from Oxford to London to Cambridge and back again". Moreover, thanks to Matthew's brilliant planning, this was to be the first multi-day 
    non-Koppa adventure, so it looked very promising!
    <br><br>
    Matthew caught the train from MYB to Oxford, which was a very nice train - basically every single seat had a table. Noice. James had been fiddling with 
    TweetyBoi 2.0, yet for the first time in his life, it was TweetyBoi 1.0 who came to the rescue and actually worked for the first time ever (mostly):

    Matthew also did a little bit of filming on the way up (but cocked it up), which you may see in the Xi 2 video. After just over an hour, he met James at Oxford station. 
    We walked over through the city to James' room at Teddy Hall for one of the last nights ever. James had been there for a month at this point, so it was a home away 
    from home... but not for much longer! We pissed about in his room for a while, drinking tea and eating fruit, before then heading down to the Isis at Magdalen College to 
    meet James' friend Usman from the Oxford Summer School.
    <br><br>
    Matthew quickly learned that Usman is a kindred spirit to him - perennially late to everything, and with a concept of time more warped than any other complex manifold 
    James has yet studied. In true Matthew spirit, Usman rocked up half an hour late. In the meantime, we had been waiting down on the slipway into the river. We had watched 
    the small queue of people dissipate, but were then shocked to find a summer school group show up, 40 or 50-strong. Oh fuck, this was bad. This was very very bad. As they'd 
    say in Camborne, <i>"O'oh Arrgh, woz 'appenin' me cock? Arrgh, th'rl n't be no p'nts dreckly!"</i>.
    <br><br>
    Fortunately, being a large group of horny teenagers, corralling them into groups of 4 and getting them on boats took an absolute age. For about 20 minutes, they were 
    unable to divide into 4s - "We can do a 3 and a 5!". Now those are <i>definitely</i> Oxford material! So when Usman showed up, we just slipped into the queue of year 12s, 
    aiming to blend in, and when we were spotted, we merely said "We were already queueing" (not entirely false), and were waved through! Vey nice!
    <br><br>
    After waiting for half an hour he turned up and we went punting – James 
    first, Usman second and Matthew last. James caused many, many crashes along the way, but Matthew seemed rather good for a beginner. Best NT activity ever! 
    <br><br>
    We went to Moomoo and had smoothies, then waited in Teddy Hall for a bit, before running in just 10 minutes across the entire city to catch the once-a-day train to MIM. 
    Almost died as a result. Matthew looked like he had seen death. Ticked off a few picturesque stations before being given a bollocking by the conductor, so invoked the 
    ‘angry conductor’ rule and stayed onboard for the rest of the halts. We visited MIM Co-op, then caught the next train to Great Malvern via Wozza, filming all the way. 
    Filmed more stuff at Great Malvern then caught the train to Hereford. Met Matthew's uncle Nick and and his grandmother in Hereford station, then drove off. We waited 
    ages for fish and chips, then went back to Matthew's uncle's house to eat them. Met Matthew's aunt Sarah and Nelson the dog who growled when he was happy. We had a 
    nice meal, before flooring it back to the station. Caught the train back, and saw a TfW train on the way!
    <br><br>
    We had a very long conversation on the way back, before transferring to the RRB at Wozza. We had it mostly to ourselves, so ranted about politics for 2 hours - fun. 
    #RRBTime! We showed up in to Oxford at half past midnight, and Matthew cycled around Oxford with a camera for 25 minutes in the pouring rain, whilst James hopped 
    from shelter to shelter - NT Smooth Jazz will be coming soon! We went back to James' room, made up the second bed for Matthew, then talked about Ffynone until stupid 
    o’clock in the morning. Woke up tired. 
    <br><br>
    We had breakfast then headed out to the station, but missed the train by but a few seconds, so instead hopped back to Teddy Hall again. Matthew went to the Queens Lane 
    Café (oldest in Europe) and had Turkish Coffee, Turkish Delight and a Bagel, before meeting James, crossing the street and going to the Grand Café (Iacobus Iudaecus) 
    for cream tea. Vey nice. 
    <br><br>
    We went to Teddy Hall once more, before walking back to the station yet again to try and tick off Islip, and finally succeeded. We walked around Bicester Village itself, 
    got absolutely drenched and attempted to recreate the Xi 1 clip. We returned to the station, filmed more shit (including NT-phile), then went back to Oxford and Teddy 
    Hall for the last time. Matthew collected his stuff and James' bike, then cycled off to Oxford station. He caught the train back to MYB and cycled home (~23 mins).
