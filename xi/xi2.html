<p>
    Here's an idea - why don't we go halfway across the country on shitty stopping services with angry conductors and attempt to be abandoned? Oh and let's 
    start in the middle of the evening!
    <br><br>
    It was time to head back to Oxford! We'd been planning this adventure for quite a while as the first segment of "The Summer of NT"/"How can James transport 
    all his worldly belongings from Oxford to London to Cambridge and back again". Moreover, thanks to Matthew's brilliant planning, this was to be the first multi-day 
    non-Koppa adventure, so it looked very promising!
    <br><br>
    Matthew caught the train from MYB to Oxford, which was a very nice train - basically every single seat had a table. Noice. James had been fiddling with 
    TweetyBoi 2.0, yet for the first time in his life, it was TweetyBoi 1.0 who came to the rescue and actually worked for the first time ever (mostly):

    Matthew also did a little bit of filming on the way up (but cocked it up), which you may see in the Xi 2 video. After just over an hour, he met James at Oxford station. 
    We walked over through the city to James' room at Teddy Hall for one of the last nights ever. James had been there for a month at this point, so it was a home away 
    from home... but not for much longer! We pissed about in his room for a while, drinking tea and eating fruit, before then heading down to the Isis at Magdalen College to 
    meet James' friend Usman from the Oxford Summer School.
    <br><br>
    Matthew quickly learned that Usman is a kindred spirit to him - perennially late to everything, and with a concept of time more warped than any other complex manifold 
    James has yet studied. In true Matthew spirit, Usman rocked up half an hour late. In the meantime, we had been waiting down on the slipway into the river. We had watched 
    the small queue of people dissipate, but were then shocked to find a summer school group show up, 40 or 50-strong. Oh fuck, this was bad. This was very very bad. As they'd 
    say in Camborne, <i>"O'oh Arrgh, woz 'appenin' me cock? Arrgh, th'rl n't be no p'nts dreckly!"</i>.
    <br><br>
    Fortunately, being a large group of horny teenagers, corralling them into groups of 4 and getting them on boats took an absolute age. For about 20 minutes, they were 
    unable to divide into 4s - "We can do a 3 and a 5!". Now those are <i>definitely</i> Oxford material! So when Usman showed up, we just slipped into the queue of year 12s, 
    aiming to blend in, and when we were spotted, we merely said "We were already queueing" (not entirely false), and were waved through! Vey nice!
    <br><br>
    After they nicked the boat that had been assigned to us, we got on a new one, whereby James assigned himself the role of Captain, before running to the end 
    of the boat and grabbing the long metal pole. Usman boarded the near end, and took the oar, and Matthew thus got into the middle of the boat, crossing his fingers 
    that he wouldn't end up in the river within the next hour.
    <br><br>
    James tried his best though. No sooner had we reversed out of our moorings, we then immediately crashed straight into the side of another boat. What a great start. We then 
    crashed into the bridge, into the same boat again, into another boat, into some parked boats, into a 3rd boat, before causing a massive pile-up in the river. Yay! 
    We love being public nuisances here at NT! James was clearly just embracing his inner Cornish seaman - as they'd say in 'Zance, <i>"Ooh Arrgh Ci'y Boi! Ain't no 
    trrraff'c j'ms out sea!"</i>. So naturally, James adopted the tried and tested method of <strong>"SPEED AND POWERRRRR!"</strong> to get us through. Oh God. This 
    entire section is on camera, which James will edit into a Youtube video, so you can experience this LIVE in 4D for but a small fee (impeding sense of doom not included 
    in the price).
    <br><br>
    We continued down the river, past Magdalen College itself, continuing to cause crashes with other orthogonal boats, and spending most of the time scraping violently along 
    the river bank, determined to destroy as much as possible. See, when Menna taught us about erosion back in Ffynone, she taught us that there were 4 processes of 
    erosion - Attrition, Abrasion, Solution and Hydraulic Action. But after Xi 2, I can confirm that Menna neglected to tell us about the 5th process - James.
    <br><br>
    Meanwhile, whilst we were busy fearing for our lives, Matthew and Usman were busy talking, filming an unboxing video, and listening to classical guitar music whilst being 
    "steered" down the river. Enjoy these timeless quotes:
    <br><br>
    <strong>
    James! 2 orthogonal vectors straight ahead!<br>
    Welcome to my unboxing, please like and subscribe<br>
    They didn't call Erdos an all-rounder for nothing - some fluid dynamics in the morning, some boxing in the afternoon, some Lie Groups in the evening!<br>
    Oi, that's just my dissertation!
    </strong>
    <br><br>
    At the bottom of the stretch of river, we all switched places - Matthew took the oar, Usman took the pole, and James lay there in the middle, sunning himself 
    and enjoying the look of pain and fear in Matthew and Usman's eyes after having endured half an hour of crashes. Usman took us around the bend in the river and onto 
    the next straight, and our crash rate immediately plummeted to almost 0. Hmm, I wonder why. With Usman on the back of the boat, this reminded James of the Oxford 
    Summer School. Great Success!
    <br><br>
    Matthew meanwhile enjoyed being in charge of the oar, and so when we switched again at the end of that strait, Matthew took the back of the boat for the first time. 
    This has to have been one of his favourite NT experiences of all time - punting down the ISIS. It was really glorious. Matthew listened to Usman's advice about using 
    the pole like a rudder, and ignored all of James' advice, and thus didn't crash once (we had a close call with a low hanging branch, but that was it), even managing to 
    moor the boat! We disembarked and then walked up back to Teddy Hall for Matthew to collect some stuff, before heading to the covered market.
    <br><br>
    All 3 of us then went to Moomoo and had smoothies, which were honestly delicious. We didn't know we needed them, but we absolutely did. After this, we said our 
    goodbyes to Usman, and headed back to Teddy Hall once more.
    <br><br>
    <strong>That's dummy thicc</strong>
    <br><br>
    We waited in Teddy Hall for a bit. And by 'a bit', I mean 'a bit too long'. Before we knew it, we had only about 15 minutes to get to the station on the other side 
    of the city... and one of us would have to go on foot. Matthew tried to make a break for it, but was thwarted by his lack of a key for the front gate to the college. 
    Bugger. He waited for James to come, who unlocked the gate for him, and went to collect his bike, whilst Matthew shot off like a rocket, sprinting down Queens Lane 
    towards the Ashmolean. Matthew ran continuously all the way to the gates of Trinity College before running out of breath, collapsing and dying. James then overtook 
    Matthew's corpse, before getting stuck at a traffic light and being overtaken by Matthew again, who was back to sprinting. Matthew then kept sprinting all the way to 
    the business school, when his heart gave up on him and he was forced to walk. James meanwhile had struck a huge queue of traffic, so overtook them all by cycling down 
    the middle of the road, almost becoming a pancake in the process. He then 'locked' his bike outside the business school, and ran after Matthew.
    <br><br>
    Matthew crawled up the ramp to the station, his arteries about to explode from his blood pressure. He looked up at the dot matrices to see that, OH MY GOD, the dot 
    matrix was kill. Every single pixel was having a fucking spasm. It was worse than the blue screen of death. Even worse, the <i>only</i> fucked dot matrix was the one 
    for our train. All the rest were functioning perfectly. Matthew glanced around furtively, looking for data to absorb (like Zuckerberg), before eventually finding the 
    platform - PLATFORM 4! Quick! Go!<br>
    ...<br> 
    Except he couldn't. James wasn't there! No!
    <br><br>
    James then came sprinting in, asking which platform it was. Matthew told him, then sprinted through the barriers, only to find that James had yet to buy tickets. Is 
    this how our adventure ends? Stuck at the ticket barrier because we had left the tickets to the last minute? Matthew couldn't bear to look, and so sprinted across to 
    platform 4 anyway, hoping James would follow.
    <br><br>
    Matthew reached the platform, leaned forwards against a metal pillar, and promptly fainted from exhaustion. The End. I hope you enjoyed this adventure.
    <br><br><br><br>
    But wait! James then came sprinting across the bridge, descending to the platform and asking "Have we missed it?". To any onlooker, this might have seemed the case, 
    but no! The train was delayed by just enough for James to make it! It pulled into the platform and we jumped aboard before melting into the nearest seats, dead.
    <br><br>
    The entire ordeal had taken 10 minutes exactly, from Teddy Hall to the ticket barrier. And they were the toughest 10 minutes of our lives. Let us never, ever do that again! 
    <br><br>
    Matthew looked like a corpse, and so took a few minutes to recover. He looked as if he had seen the afterlife, but it was all worth it - we had caught the once a day 
    train to Moreton-in-Marsh, stopping at every single tiny little station in the middle of nowhere!
    <br><br>
    We got the camera equipment out, and started filming. We soon started jumping on and off when we reached the quiet, picturesque country halts. We ticked off 
    Combe, which Matthew was very enamoured by (it was just a platform in the middle of a field), and Finstock (which James was very pleased about - it is the least used 
    station in Oxfordshire - TICK!). We then passed Charlbury, right next to Jeremy Clarkson's Farm. At this station, James ran all the way down the length of the platform 
    to catch the station sign, before running all the way back to the doors that he started at, looking like an absolute madman in the process. And this was where the 
    problem started. 
    <br><br>
    There we were, just starting to film an NT update, when the conductor came over and gave us an absolute bollocking. This was even worse than the Heart of Wales line - 
    at least he had just stopped us from disembarking - this conductor outright told us that he intended to leave us behind if we disembarked again. To make matters 
    worse, as this was the only train of the day, if we got abandoned, we were absolutely screwed. We looked sheepish, nodded, and sat down. A rethink was in order.
</p>
<ol>
    <li> Hence, we came up with the Angry Conductor Clause, which can henceforth be invoked where applicable:
        <ul> 
          <li> This allows us to neglect stepping down onto the platform. </li>
          <li> The station can be ticked off as visited provided that the doors open at the station, even if we did not open them ourselves. </li>
          <li> If there are no passengers dis/embarking, we must open the doors ourselves </li>
          <li> We must still take a photograph/video of the station sign </li>
        </ul>
     </li>
</ol>
<p>
    With this rule change under our belt, we continued, at a far more subdued pace than before. At Ascott (which James thought was Royal Ascot), we 
    realised why he was angry - the doors were open for a mere 10 seconds before closing. We were clearly very late. Hence, from now on, we stayed 
    firmly on the train, and filmed out of the window and/or open doors.
    <br><br>
    Before long, we arrived at the terminus in Moreton-in-Marsh (MIM), which, true to what it says on the tin, is definitely in a marsh. We had a few minutes to kill, so 
    we visited the (very posh) Co-op and did some filming whilst we awaited Train #2!
</p>
<center><img width="55%" src="../resources/photos/MIM.JPG"></center>
<p>
    Our train then arrived, and we settled in for the journey to Great Malvern via Wozza, filming all the way. We started up TweetyBoi again, to... questionable effect. 
    Still a little shaken by our brush with Simon, the angry conductor, we continued with the angry conductor clause, and remained on the train. 
    <br><br>
    Having said that, it probably wasn't necessary. As soon as we entered the territory of West Midlands Railway, all the staff were enormously friendly and helpful. They 
    even encouraged James to leap off at Wozza Foregate Street to film the old semaphore signals. WMR - hats off to you!
    <br><br>
    We also passed the brand new Wozza Parkway station, which looked absolutely fantastic. It struck Matthew as quite odd that no-one had thought to build it before - it is 
    in a very useful location! We will definitely be going back at some point to give our many viewers the lowdown on the station when we change at Wozza Parkway for a future 
    trip to REDACTED.

    Filmed more stuff at Great Malvern then caught the train to Hereford. Met Matthew's uncle Nick and and his grandmother in Hereford station, then drove off. We waited 
    ages for fish and chips, then went back to Matthew's uncle's house to eat them. Met Matthew's aunt Sarah and Nelson the dog who growled when he was happy. We had a 
    nice meal, before flooring it back to the station. Caught the train back, and saw a TfW train on the way!
    <br><br>
    We had a very long conversation on the way back, before transferring to the RRB at Wozza. We had it mostly to ourselves, so ranted about politics for 2 hours - fun. 
    #RRBTime! We showed up in to Oxford at half past midnight, and Matthew cycled around Oxford with a camera for 25 minutes in the pouring rain, whilst James hopped 
    from shelter to shelter - NT Smooth Jazz will be coming soon! We went back to James' room, made up the second bed for Matthew, then talked about Ffynone until stupid 
    o’clock in the morning. Woke up tired. 
    <br><br>
    We had breakfast then headed out to the station, but missed the train by but a few seconds, so instead hopped back to Teddy Hall again. Matthew went to the Queens Lane 
    Café (oldest in Europe) and had Turkish Coffee, Turkish Delight and a Bagel, before meeting James, crossing the street and going to the Grand Café (Iacobus Iudaecus) 
    for cream tea. Vey nice. 
    <br><br>
    We went to Teddy Hall once more, before walking back to the station yet again to try and tick off Islip, and finally succeeded. We walked around Bicester Village itself, 
    got absolutely drenched and attempted to recreate the Xi 1 clip. We returned to the station, filmed more shit (including NT-phile), then went back to Oxford and Teddy 
    Hall for the last time. Matthew collected his stuff and James' bike, then cycled off to Oxford station. He caught the train back to MYB and cycled home (~23 mins).
