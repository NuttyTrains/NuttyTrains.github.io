    Do I remember what happened here? Not really. I think I saw n...n...nature? Not entirely sure how that is pronounced.

    <strong>WELCOME TO THE DEEPEST, DARKEST AMNESIA ZONE!</strong>
    <br><br>
    The 12th adventure on this journey marks one final mystery adventure that I have absolutely 0 recollection of - 4th year was fun! After this point, my sanity 
    remains deeply questionable, but my recollections begin to improve - let's exit the void with a [bang/whimper] (delete as applicable).

    -------------
    Students of NT history who have been paying sufficiently close attention over the years ought to have noted that May is a very unusual time 
    for NT adventures. It is true that we had a mini adventure in May 2022 to celebrate the opening of the Lizzie line, but in general, 
    Matthew's 'I don't leave London' moratorium is at its very strongest in May - exam season. This however was the end of 4th year, and Matthew 
    was spending pretty much every night drinking away the pain, so when James proposed that Matthew come to Oxford to watch them act in the 
    Mandrake, he thought 'well, fuck it, why not?'. I can't say that either of us remember much of this play, given that the only thing holding 
    both of us together by this point was constant wine-drinking. Either way, Matthew probably enjoyed, despite heading immediately to the college 
    bar to get plastered on whisky without even saying hi to James, and even decided to get a drink in some random pub in Didcot in his 15 minute 
    transfer time. This was a fun time.

    Knowing all this, it then seems even stranger that we decided to head out for an NT adventure the very next day - getting Matthew to leave 
    London during exam season was pretty unprecedented, and yet this was the 3rd such trip in as many weeks! Of course, bearing last night in 
    mind, this was not going to be a long trip - we ended up meeting at about 3pm or something, after James' RRB died, leaking oil in Oxford 
    station car park.
    <br><br>
    Honestly, that is basically all I remember apart from the station itself, which was not bad - we'd seen much worse. It was a nice sunny day, 
    and it was located near what James informed me is called 'greenery' and 'nature'. There was even a 'lake' with 'ducks'. How very strange. 
    I think we filmed some kind of station review? If that ever sees the light of day, I am sure it is quite funny.

    Reading Green Park will eventually serve a new suburb, but right now, the only things anywhere near the station were some rather pretty 
    lakeside New England-style houses. Therefore, we decided to leave and tick off a few stations before our time ran out. We headed down the 
    line to Basingstoke, hoping to reach Winchester, but alas, the trains did not co-operate that day, so we turned around at Basingstoke. Little 
    did we realise that Basingstoke would later come to haunt us - what a horrific miserable mistake.

    And thus dear readers, we reach the end of the regularly scheduled Imperial/Oxford NT content! It has been a good run, but all 'good' things 
    must come to an end. Join us next time for the an Orphan adventure, where we end this Imperial/Oxford saga with a bang! Join us as we 
    go even further saaaf in <a href="../../NAO.html">NT South Coast</a>!
