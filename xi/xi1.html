    This isn't tourism, it is masochism. Sweet, sweet sadomasochism. Now that James has decided to <i>live</i> in the Bad Place, it was time for a painful adventure around the 
    Oxford triangle!
    <br><br>
    Following the monster adventure that was Koppa 5, James had travelled to Oxford to set up shop there for a month, and to take advantage of this close proximity, we 
    planned the start of a new class of adventures around Oxford (and Cambridge): the Xi Adventures! So, for the first time ever, Matthew and Matthew alone would be 
    travelling out of London to these adventures: RIP Matthew's wallet!
    <br><br>
    Yet to his great surprise, the train was surprisingly cheap, even with GWR. Thus, he caught his vey nice cheap train up to Oxford early in the morning. Along the way 
    he made a sub-1 minute connection in Notting Hill Gate to just make it in time (I never thought I'd say this, but I miss you NHG :( ). He arrived in 
    Oxford station after roughly an hour, and began the walk into the city, towards Teddy Hall where James was staying. Yet to his hreat surprise, he bumped into James 
    along the way, who had been walking to meet him, just outside <s>Menna</s> Jesus College. We headed to Cafe Nero and Matthew pulled out his laptop to take care of 
    some (long overdue) work whilst James headed back to Teddy Hall to have a meeting and tutor his gullible <s>money-tree</s> student.
    <br><br>
    Before long, James returned after conning his <s>money-tree</s> out of a lesson, and we headed back towards Teddy Hall. Along the way we passed many students cycling around 
    in their matriculation gowns, and another group of students trashing each other on Queens Lane, which made James' heart do a backflip and try and commit the not alive. 
    <br><br>
    Before long, we reached Teddy Hall itself - a lovely small college out on the eastern side of the town centre, but at the time of Xi 1, James only had access to very 
    little of the college (this would soon change), so we headed straight to his room. Last redecorated in the 80s, his room was nice and spacious, but definitely showed 
    its age - bits were falling to pieces, his kitchen was... questionable, and his mirror made him look dead inside (more so than usual). Noice. James grew to love it 
    eventually though.

    Whilst I am here, I would like to point out that in the course of writing these, I commonly mistype "< br >" as "< BR >". Whilst the latter would clearly be frowned upon 
    by people who actually know what they are doing, here at NT we know nothing of this, so are happy to try it out: <BR>
    If this actually works then I may start using it in future because funny.
    <br><br>
    After this room tour (which we should have filmed, but illi vitae) we headed out to the trains, back across the city centre. Unfortunately, we turned up at the wrong 
    time entirely, so missed the train heading north to Banbury. Instead, we needed a plan B.
    <br><br>
    We decided to wander up the Oxford Canal for a little bit, which was very scenic. We spotted a signpost for boats, telling them to U-turn to reach the River Thames, 
    which was very cool. We also saw many many communism signs. Clearly they don't pay enough to those lecturers slumming it in Jericho. Or maybe they are just deluded and 
    spend too much time around art students. Maybe both. Regardless, we captured all this on camera, so you can relive it in 4K*<br>
    Disclaimer: may not actually be 4K - Matthew was in charge of the camera sometimes!
    <br><br>
    We left the canal at Jericho, wandered here for a while, eavesdropping on academic conversations and admiring people's bikes (James wanted one!). 
    We returned to the town centre and walked to Gloucester Green Market, which was there on most days and was frequented often by James. We bought a punnet of cherries 
    from the Cockney woman in charge of the fruit stall, and then dropped the fruit off at Teddy Hall (eating some on the way - vey nice!).
    <br><br>
    Then, at last, we actually went to the trains, and this time did not cock up the time! We caught the train up to Banbury, jumping on and off, including at the least-used 
    station in Northamptonshire (to Matthew's enormous confusion). The journey up was through a very pretty slice of the country, next to the Oxford Canal. James always 
    approves of our more rural adventures, and even Matthew is warming up to them.
    <br><br>
    We then reached Banbury, a surprisingly large and cumbersome station for a town that size. We eventually found our way out, and walked up towards the town centre, 
    fearing the worst after James' friend said that we were going to die.
    <br><br>
    Did a tiny loop of the edge of the town centre, then returned to the station and caught a very nice train to Bicester North, which was delayed, so we missed our 
    connection. Instead, we wandered through Bicester Town centre and headed out to Bicester Village, where we filmed some clips in a multi-storey car park. We caught the 
    train, missed Islip and returned to Oxford. We went to Banana Tree and had Pad Thai and Beef Noodles, got screwed over on the service charge, and then picked up 
    Matthew's stuff at Teddy Hall and got back on the (long) train home, whilst James went drinking in Oxford.
