    This isn't tourism, it is masochism. Sweet, sweet sadomasochism. Now that James has decided to <i>live</i> in the Bad Place, it was time for a painful adventure around the 
    Oxford triangle!
    <br><br>
    Following the monster adventure that was Koppa 5, James had travelled to Oxford to set up shop there for a month, and to take advantage of this close proximity, we 
    planned the start of a new class of adventures around Oxford (and Cambridge): the Xi Adventures! So, for the first time ever, Matthew and Matthew alone would be 
    travelling out of London to these adventures: RIP Matthew's wallet!
    <br><br>
    Yet to his great surprise, the train was surprisingly cheap, even with GWR. Thus, he caught his vey nice cheap train up to Oxford early in the morning. Along the way 
    he made a sub-1 minute connection in Notting Hill Gate to just make it in time (I never thought I'd say this, but I miss you NHG :( ). He arrived in 
    Oxford station after roughly an hour, and began the walk into the city, towards Teddy Hall where James was staying. Yet to his hreat surprise, he bumped into James 
    along the way, who had been walking to meet him, just outside <s>Menna</s> Jesus College. We headed to Cafe Nero and Matthew pulled out his laptop to take care of 
    some (long overdue) work whilst James headed back to Teddy Hall to have a meeting and tutor his gullible <s>money-tree</s> student.

    Before long, James returned after conning his <s>money-tree</s> out of a lesson, and we headed back towards Teddy Hall. Along the way we passed many students cycling around 
    in their matriculation gowns, and another group of students trashing each other on Queens Lane, which made James' heart do a backflip and try and commit the not alive. 
    <br><br>
    Before long, we reached Teddy Hall itself - a lovely small college out on the eastern side of the town centre, but at the time of Xi 1, James only had access to very 
    little of the college (this would soon change), so we headed straight to his room. Last redecorated in the 80s, his room was nice and spacious, but definitely showed 
    its age - bits were falling to pieces, his kitchen was... questionable, and his mirror made him look dead inside (more so than usual). Noice. James grew to love it 
    eventually though.

    Whilst I am here, I would like to point out that in the course of writing these, I commonly mistype "< br >" as "< BR >". Whilst the latter would clearly be frowned upon 
    by people who actually know what they are doing, here at NT we know nothing of this, so are happy to try it out: <BR>
    If this actually works then I may start using it in future because funny.<BR>
    Edit: Holy Shit it works! Time to BR my way through future accounts!
    <br><br>
    After this room tour (which we should have filmed, but illi vitae) we headed out to the trains, back across the city centre. Unfortunately, we turned up at the wrong 
    time entirely, so missed the train heading north to Banbury. Instead, we needed a plan B.
    <br><br>
    We decided to wander up the Oxford Canal for a little bit, which was very scenic. We spotted a signpost for boats, telling them to U-turn to reach the River Thames, 
    which was very cool. We also saw many many communism signs. Clearly they don't pay enough to those lecturers slumming it in Jericho. Or maybe they are just deluded and 
    spend too much time around art students. Maybe both. Regardless, we captured all this on camera, so you can relive it in 4K*<br>
    Disclaimer: may not actually be 4K - Matthew was in charge of the camera sometimes!
    <br><br>
    We also spotted many commie ducks. We love communisms.
</p>

<p>
    We left the canal at Jericho, wandered here for a while, eavesdropping on academic conversations and admiring people's bikes (James wanted one!). 
    We returned to the town centre and walked to Gloucester Green Market, which was there on most days and was frequented often by James. We bought a punnet of cherries 
    from the Cockney woman in charge of the fruit stall, and then dropped the fruit off at Teddy Hall (eating some on the way - vey nice!).
    <br><br>
    Then, at last, we actually went to the trains, and this time did not cock up the time! We caught the train up to Banbury, jumping on and off, including at the least-used 
    station in Northamptonshire (to Matthew's enormous confusion). The journey up was through a very pretty slice of the country, next to the Oxford Canal. James always 
    approves of our more rural adventures, and even Matthew is warming up to them.
    <br><br>
    We then reached Banbury, a surprisingly large and cumbersome station for a town that size. We eventually found our way out, and walked up towards the town centre, 
    fearing the worst after James' friend said that we were going to die. James accordingly hid all his camera equipment away:
    <br><br>
    <strong>"Do you not like brown people, James?"<br>
    "We loves a bit of 中国人, we does"</strong>
    <br><br>
    But in all fairness, Banbury seemed alright. That isn't to say we were there long. We literally walked to the edge of the town centre, saw the nearest shops, then 
    immediately reversed course and returned to the station. Noice Sampi vibes!
    <br><br>
    As ever, we had left this connection a little tight, so we ran through the station car park, hearing the announcements for our train, ran up the stairs to the ticket 
    barriers, and James passed through... but not Matthew, whose ticket fucked itself at the last minute. Barging in front of an annoying chav woman, Matthew managed to 
    get his ticket sorted, and then sprinted down the stairs to the platform after James... only to find that our train was delayed. Fuck. This was bad. RIP our plans! 
    <br><br>
    The fact that the train, when it did arrive, was extremely noice, partially made up for this. Fortunately we had no stations to tick off on this section of line, 
    because if we did, we'd have probably missed them - we were too busy admiring the train! The seats were lovely, there were plenty of tables, and there was even a map 
    of all the lines and stations served by Chiltern Railways (very helpful for future Xi adventures). They even offered a free streaming service! We were simply blown 
    away. For Matthew, used to travelling on functional, but basic tube trains, for James, used to travelling on Kernow's <s>Castle</s> Cattle Class trains (except on 
    Wednesdays), and for NT, used to whatever crap Markey had stolen for the valleys that week, this was truly a step above. Fantasteg!
    <br><br>
    Despite this, we still pulled into Bicester North late, meaning that we had missed our all-important connection back to Oxford, as the stopping service arrived only 
    once per 2 hours. Instead, we decided to just fuck it and head back to Oxford anyway - screw Islip for today (see the continuation of the Islip saga in Xi 2: out now 
    in an account literally down the page from this one).
    <br><br>
    Bicester North included tantalising glimpses of what was to come: all the station signs had Chinese on them! The direction signs, the timetables, the everything! 
    Even the bus waiting just outside the station was covered in the stuff! James could simply smell the 中国人, and he was excited! Now it was time to head to their 
    epicentre: Bicester Village, on the other side of town! (We would have taken the bus, but Matthew's inner Thatcherite will not tolerate it, and it was bloddy 
    expensive anyway, so we fucked it and decided to walk instead).
    <br><br>
    We began the long walk through Bicester Town centre, developing our parody skills by spoofing Geoff, Tom Scott and filming a fuckton of meta shots when James 
    managed to go the wrong way. We passed a multistorey car park (maybe a 7/10: seemed respectible enough - Matthew x), and entered the town centre, which yet again 
    seemed perfectly alright - it always surprises us when we head to towns in Southern England - no matter how shit an experience we are promised, they always turn out 
    alright, which is completely alien to us after the Sampi, Koppa and Digamma adventures. MAKE NT SHIT AGAIN! 
    <br><br>
    <strong><i>"Ooh Jamie, no go Bicester Village without me! Ooh no!"</i></strong>
    <br><br>
    Thus, to try and worsen the quality of this adventure, we did exactly that: we headed out to Bicester Village. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we never 
    actually made it further than the multi-storey car park (8/10 - great car park, great sodium lighting, but needed MOAR floors), where we filmed one of the most 
    iconic NT clips of all time: 我爱西京平和朴廷.

<p>
    We finally returned to the station, and caught our train home, missing Islip along the way (the Gilfach Fargoed of Xi), and returning to Oxford.

<p>
    To round off the day, we went to Banana Tree, where James had been on the Oxford summer school. We had Pad Thai and Beef Noodles, which was nice, but then got 
    screwed over on the service charge. Needless to say, we took account of this slight, and screwed <i>them</i> over in the NT Michelin guide. They'll rue the day 
    that they miscalulated a percentage on <i>our</i> bill!
    <br><br>
    Finally, we picked up Matthew's stuff at Teddy Hall, walked back to the station, and parted ways for the next month. Matthew got back on the (long) train home, 
    which seemed to be slower than the tube as soon as we crossed the M25, whilst James went drinking in Oxford and got as drunk as a rat. 我爱西京平和朴廷
