	Oh no. It was time to throw ourselves straight into the jaws of danger and permanently damage our hearing: it was Brummy time! Along the way, we went on a 
    little tiny train and saw CAT. MAO!

	Matthew left Paddington early and headed to Oxford, where James boarded the train, off to Wozza. We spent the entire journey through 
	the Cotswolds trying to solve his TMiP Puzzles, which Matthew had initially refused to touch, before then taking hold of them 
	voraciously and blitzing through most of them in his head. It turns out that James is regularly assigned a handicap at these events 
	to stop him from dominating, and this time, the handicap was GWR wifi, which was utterly crap and stopped us from accessing any internet 
	at all. We decided to wait until we reached Wozza and had some breakfast. Matthew treated himself to some Lapsang, to the disgust of James' 
	nose - it completely overpowered the smell of his (already pungent) mint tea. Once there, we blitzed through all of them, but managed to 
	fuck up somewhere. Whoops. We then ran to the station (Foregate Street), and boarded the first train to Kidderminster.

	At Kidderminster, we changed to a slow train in order to tick off every station on the line, and this gave us a little bit of time. 
	We exited the station and immediately found an older station, just sitting in the new car park - we had found another heritage line! 
	This one was completely rammed to the gunnels with old GWR signs, posters and memorabilia, most of it from Cornwall, which James 
	loved. We'll have to go back. Nevertheless, our train soon arrived, and we boarded, ticking off the stops on the way up the line.
	<br><br>
	We reached Stourbridge Junction and immediately sought out George, the station cat. He was amazing, but didn't like James very much. 
	We bought our 95p tickets and boarded the tiny train. James was completely enamoured! It even had a display about Geoff and Vicky inside 
	the train! Stourbridge, on the other hand, was less impressive. It was clearly in the north. It was next to Dudley, to James' horror. 
	It even reminded us of Merthyr Tydfil, and that is not a good thing.

	After an hour in Stourbridge, Matthew's stupid plan continued and we continued on the slow train. The station names became more and more 
	stereotypical Midlands - "The Hawthorns" being our favourite. Could you get anymore Midlands? Just so you are aware, dear readers, TweetyBoi 
	decided that today was the day he was going to cock up again, and so he decided that whilst NT would in fact be alighting at Brummy, he would 
	not be tweeting that. Have a look for yourselves:

	We finally arrived in Birmingham Snow Hill, which was the most Birmingham building ever - we were dumped in the arse end of a concrete 
	monstrosity, with dim, flickering lighting, exposed wiring hanging from the ceiling, and asbestos everywhere. Yummy.
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Birmingham Snow Hill.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	Birmingham itself was no better. Concrete <i>everywhere</i>. It was all a bit shit really. We made our way over to the Bullring, passing 
	the tram construction site, and entered the shopping centre, which was 40 degrees Celsius and had some "entertainment" for the plebs. We 
	exited the Bullring and walked over to Birmingham New Street, which had recently been rebuilt, and was also filled with "entertainment", 
	this time of the art student variety. 
	<br><br>
	<strong>"This stone is bouncy"</strong>
	<br><br>
	After trying to recreate James' previous visit here with Matt Parker, we wandered down a dodgy 
	sidestreet, past a selection of Chinese takeaways serving bat soup, before we came across a kind of gastropub called 'The Stables'. 
	This was really nice - we both had pizza and tried a selection of ciders - that is right, dear readers, James got Matthew to not only 
	try, but drink cider! In fact, Matthew ended up having about a 1/3 pint of cider all to himself! How times change! James preferred the West Country 
	cider the most ('Ooh arrgh cityy boyyyy! Thaaat'll put some 'airs on yerr chest!'), which Matthew also liked, but Matthew ended up downing the 
	Lemon & Lime one. We weren't keen on the modern one or the flavoured Perry. They ruined the ciderrrr!
	<br><br>
	We then left 'The Stables' and were going to go to the trams, but then something on the map caught our eye - Chinatown! We immediately 
	changed our plans and headed for glorious leader Xi. We passed many shitty takeaways and walked across an urban motorway before passing 
	under the most miserable underpass in history, where we reached a pagoda, in the middle of a motorway roundabout, framed by 2 council 
	towers on either side. Very picturesque.
	<br><br>
	<strong>"When I think of Birmingham, I think of concrete and motorways"</strong>
	<br><br>
	We looked more for Chinatown, but instead stumbled across the Gay Village, to James' delight. There were pride flags everywhere, and we 
	passed the site of Brummy Pride.
	<br><br>
	We reached the edge of the Gay Village and then stumbled across some enormous hole in the ground, stretching for miles in every 
	direction, the only buildings being the half-demolished walls of some long forgotten concrete multi-storey car park. We deemed this 
	a suitable representative sample of Birmingham, so we named it "Birmingham General" in tribute (turns out it was actually Curzon 
	Street).
</p>
<center><iframe id="largevid" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSjkN-vOOCM" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>
<p>
	We then returned to Chinatown by accident, and filmed a guide to the magnificent sights there, before going up in the lift, back to 
	the urban motorway and back into the Bullring, to attempt to walk through Link Street, which was a flying walkway above the motorway. 
	This was our goal now; our one purpose - walk through Link Street.
	<br><br>
	Unfortunately, Link Street was shit. And by shit, I mean it was done out professionally. We had been expecting the kind of walkway found 
	in Parc Tawe, but alas, no. Interestingly though, on the way, James was grabbed by some random stranger, who turned out to be a random 
	acquaintance from the Oxford Summer School. What a small world!
	<br><br>
	Disgusted by Link Street, we decided to leave Brummy and take some trams. We walked through Brummy, passing the McDonalds that James 
	went to with Matt Parker (and recreated an old clip), and reached the tram terminus. It took us a while to work out the lack of Oyster 
	tappy-taps, but we decided to fuck it and board anyway (we bought a ticket on the tram).
	<br><br>
	The tram was not as amusing as Croydon's tram, and we were terrified of being stabbed at every stop. Moreover, the trams were kill in 
	the opposite direction, so we were terrified that we were going to be stuck in Wolverhampton. The doors barely opened at every stop 
	before they closed again, so we decided to give up on jumping on and off, so just filmed from the comforts of our seats, which took away 
	some of the classic NT flavour.
	<br><br>
	Along the way, Matthew became increasingly worried about being abandoned, as we diverged further and further from the train line, and so eventually, 
	we changed to the tram in the opposite direction, and decided to head back once we'd reached West Brom. As we had waited on the outbound tram for the first 
	tram in the opposite direction, this first tram was utterly rammed, but Matthew squeezed himself on anyway, to James' horror, even after James had refused 
	outright to board. We changed to the second after a few stops, to allow James to breathe chock-free.
	<br><br>
	We made it back to The Hawthorns, a station on the mainline, so changed to the train platforms. It turns out that the train was severely 
	delayed, so Matthew needn't have worried anyway! We listened to some quality Birmingham accents from some quality Birmingham chavs.
	<br><br>
	The train turned up, and we were back on our way. We passed through Birmingham Moor Street, which unlike Snow Hill, is really pretty 
	and stuffed with old signs and GWR artifacts everywhere. Looks like we know which terminus we'd rather turn up to! We missed Bordesley, 
	a stupid station with 1 train per week (that is less than Camborne!), and headed down the line to Dorridge, after which the train veered off 
	towards Stratford-upon-Avon.
	<br><br>
	Here, we went for a wander. We went to a petrol station (yummy carcinogens) and then headed to Sainsbury's to buy some cheap iced 
	coffee, which was utterly foul.
	<br><br>
	So there we were. Sitting by the entrance to a Sainsbury's car park in a crappy outer suburb of Birmingham, drinking iced coffee as the 
	sun started to set. If that isn't the most NT thing ever, I don't know what is!
	<br><br>
	<strong>"The bubble was annoying me!"</strong>
	<br><br>
	After failing to find the park, we got back on the train, ticked off the 1tp2h station, Lapworth (tick!), and headed to Leamington Spa 
	(now called LeSpa), passing through Warwick on the way (not the university, but the town, which unlike the university, is quite nice). 
	That train was lethal. Illegally hot. It was like we had stepped back into the Central line!
	<br><br>
	We wandered around Leamington Spa and managed to reach the river, before <i>sprinting</i> back into the sunset, back to the train. 
	It was very beautiful. As we went off down the line, watching the sunset over the English countryside, not even the smell of the 
	Crosscountry train could change the mood. All in life was good.
	<br><br>
	<strong>"All praise the great sky river!"</strong>

	<br><br>
	We got off at Oxford, and James showed Matthew his new room in Teddy Hall on his last night there, before he disposed of his old suitcase 
	in Tom's office/someone else's bathroom. We finally uploaded the week's video whilst we there there: I present to you, Commie Ducks!

	Matthew then finally took possession of James' bike, cycled to the station, fought with the 
	bike rack, and wedged himself in the bike store for the entire journey home, being overtaken by many faster trains. Finally, he 
	disembarked at Paddington and cycled home, getting lost in a council estate in Westbourne and singing about how he was going to die all 
	the way. He got home and was absolutely shattered. Good thing there wasn't another NT adventure tomorrow!
