    Welcome to Xi 7, yet another mistaken adventure that we simply do not have the energy for. On the menu today is Reading, the end of the Lizzie line, 
    Didcot and that bloody line into Oxford
    <br><br>
    Quite frankly, we were too dead today to do anything insane - so we didn't. We had a jolly up to Henley, down to IKEA, tried to avoid the Great Western Mainline 
    dying, and fully embraced being old codgers.
