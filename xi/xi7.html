    Welcome to Xi 7, yet another mistaken adventure that we simply do not have the energy for. On the menu today is Reading, the end of the Lizzie line, 
    Didcot and that bloody line into Oxford
    <br><br>
    Quite frankly, we were too dead today to do anything insane - so we didn't. We had a jolly up to Henley, down to IKEA, tried to avoid the Great Western Mainline 
    dying, and fully embraced being old codgers.

    <strong>WELCOME BACK TO THE AMNESIA ZONE!</strong>
    <br><br>
    Join Matthew on the 6th episode of his archaeological dig as we asymptotically approach the traumas of 2022/23. Matthew had just returned from 
    Paris for a few days, and James was busy settling into their new life at Oxford - we were both pretty busy and dreading the start of term. We had a 
    very short adventure this time, but that is functionally all I remember - who knows what happened here? Join me as I find out!
