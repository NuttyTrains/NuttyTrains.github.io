<p>
    Welcome to Xi 7, yet another mistaken adventure that we simply do not have the energy for. On the menu today is Reading, the end of the Lizzie line, 
    Didcot and that bloody line into Oxford
    <br><br>
    Quite frankly, we were too dead today to do anything insane - so we didn't. We had a jolly up to Henley, down to IKEA, tried to avoid the Great Western Mainline 
    dying, and fully embraced being old codgers.

    <strong>WELCOME BACK TO THE AMNESIA ZONE!</strong>
    <br><br>
    Join Matthew on the 6th episode of his archaeological dig as we asymptotically approach the traumas of 2022/23. Matthew had just returned from 
    Paris for a few days, and James was busy settling into their new life at Oxford - we were both pretty busy and dreading the start of term. We had a 
    very short adventure this time, but that is functionally all I remember - who knows what happened here? Join me as I find out!

Shall we just meet in Oxford then?
<br><br>
<b>James — 18/09/2022 17:38</b><br>
Yeah, lets do that
<br><br>
<b>Matthew — 18/09/2022 17:39</b><br>
Or we can meet in Reading or something. I don't really mind<br>
Actually, let's do Oxford<br>
It'll let you have a lie in xD
<br><br>
<b>James — 18/09/2022 17:41</b><br>
That'll be grand.
<br><br>
<b>Matthew — 18/09/2022 17:47</b><br>
I don't have much I want to do<br>
And it is close enough to term that I don't want to stay late<br>
I basically intend to do Reading-Oxford, that missing Henley station, the last 2 Lizzie line stops and maybe Reading IKEA<br>
Then in the evening I might check up on my sister in Reading Uni<br>
She moved in yesterday
<br><br>
<b>James — 18/09/2022 17:57</b><br>
Grand
<br><br><br>
<b>James — 18/09/2022 21:36</b><br>
I also have a housemate named Max
<br><br><br>
<b>James — 20/09/2022 09:16</b><br>
When are you planning on getting here?
<br><br>
<b>Matthew — 20/09/2022 10:31</b><br>
I had a lie in after I discovered that all the lines out of PAD were closed xD<br>
12, methinks<br>
Hopefully that gives you time to make yourself less ded
<br><br>
<b>Matthew — 20/09/2022 11:29</b><br>
Actually, I am running extremely late and am ded<br>
Could we meet in Reading?
<br><br>
<b>James — 20/09/2022 11:36</b><br>
I haven’t even got out of bed<br>
I can meet you in Reading
<br><br>
<b>Matthew — 20/09/2022 11:37</b>
Haha, I got out of bed 60 seconds ago<br>
We'll play it by ear<br>
I'll make my way towards PAD and see what happens
<br><br>
<b>James — 20/09/2022 11:37</b><br>
I am planning to alive in the next 30s

    So as the above messages show, we were already pretty tired going into this adventure, and Paddington was clearly <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-62929206">not co-operating</a> 
    either. James had recently arrived in Oxford for their year of MMSC (you'll learn more about this as the amnesia zone progresses), and Matthew was very much on 
    edge as term approached. Consequently, this was to be a very short and sweet adventure... when it eventually started. All the lines out of Paddington were closed, 
    thanks to trains becoming tangled in overhead wires. It looks as if I finally made it to Reading (astonishingly, this was our first visit to Reading) at about 1pm.

<p>
    We were so deeply unprepared for this adventure that we had brought 0 camera equipment - just our phones... which is very fortunate for 2024 Matthew, because he can 
    see all the photos and videos we took without waiting until 2028 for them to appear on YouTube! Consequently - please enjoy this unusually cinematic account of our 
    adevnture (if the YouTube video ever releases, I will replace the below videos with the nice edited version - there is plenty more content I cannot load here!)
    <br><br>
    Our very first action was to correct our mistake from last time in this area: during Ξ5, we had started in Henley, but had failed to complete that line, because our 
    train skipped Shiplake. Well, not today - today, we were going to Shiplake, to finish that line! We took a Lizzie line train to Twyford, then headed up the branch line.
</p>

<p>
    Shiplake was a pretty little station actually. We had a nice wander as we waited for the train to return from Henley. Matthew... had a bit more than a wander. Matthew 
    was ¬health. But, on y va - it was time to head down another random line!
    <br><br>
    We made it back to Reading, this time heading for a Theale train (2024 Matthew note: it turns out that this line is a fucking nightmare - it may take many more adventures 
    to complete it), because we were headed to our next destination: IKEA! Long-time viewers may recall the #IKEAmeansIKEA challenge, where we were cruelly and brutally 
    denied participation in a contest with very poor rules. Well, 2.5 years later, we were going to show everyone that we could visit <i>ALL</i> the IKEAs, continuing 
    with Reading, a choice that had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that James had just arrived in Oxford with no cutlery or crockery to their name... We were so 
    back!

<p>
    At this point, the reader may wish to consult a map, to orient themselves correctly. The astute map-reader may note that IKEA Reading is not in fact in Theale - it 
    is on the opposite side of a motorway. I don't think James was fully aware of this. They already weren't very pleased by the quality of Theale village, and they 
    were even less impressed when Matthew started to lead them down some dodgy gravel path towards the motorway. They certainly were not happy when Matthew led James 
    directly over the M4 and all of the yummy carcinogens being emitted. They were even less happy when it turned out that there was a direct bus from Reading station 
    to IKEA.
    <br><br>
    Nevertheless, we had made it, just in time for the mandatory food stop. This is of course the most important part of any trip for James. Matthew contented himself 
    with some 'delicious'<sup>TM</sup> 'pizza', shown below:
</p>

<p>
    This was a successful shopping trip. We picked up the following items, which I remember, because <i>this was apparently the 1 thing I bothered to write down 
        about this adventure...</i>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tea Strainers</li>
    <li>Espresso Cup</li>
    <li>Half the Bargain Basement</li>
    <li>Wine Glasses</li>
    <li>The entire contents of James' kitchen</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Huh, that is quite cool - I am sitting here with that very espresso cup sitting on my desk in front of me!
    <br><br>
    Now encumbered with an enormous sack of goodies, we returned to Theale station, to catch our train back to Reading. This was to be the end of the adventure, 
    as James was very weighed down, and we were honestly both pretty shattered, so we parted ways.
    <br><br>
    But this was hardly the end of the fun! James had a really nasty time getting back home, as the GWR mainline had decided to die once more, whilst we were 
    in IKEA. Matthew meanwhile went to meet his sister (who had just started in the University of Reading), and after returning to Reading station later at night, 
    he <i>also</i> found that the GWR mainline had died - what fun! This meant that Matthew got to experience the joys of an 11pm train from Reading to Waterloo, 
    which, ladies and gentlemen... <i>is an experience</i>.

    This adventure slightly predates the Shnack Zone<sup>TM</sup> (and Yummy Matthew Snack Time<sup>TM</sup>), but let me introduce you to something almost as good...
