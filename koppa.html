<p>       Koppa Adventures: coming soon to a tube platform near you! As mentioned on <a href="./index.html"> our 
	  main page </a>, the Koppa (&#x3D9;) adventures on the tube/TfL network will follow different rules to usual. We have 
	  only recently started university, so we will be unable to undertake these frequently, but this has been planned for many 
	  months. London is uniquely suited to NT adventures due to the frequency of services and density of stations, so our 
	  adventures here should be optime!
	  <br><br>
	  So, James has gone to absolute pits and now is a big twitter enthusiast, he has created a twitter with associated twitter 
	  bot, this was what he was doing all the way up to London. Find it <a href="https://twitter.com/NuttyTrains">here</a>...

<div class="content">
<p>     Having jumped off the screaming Northern train at Tottenham Court Road at 11pm, laughing insanely, Matthew decided to sprint 
	through a 1 foot wide gap at the edge of the platform, between a slow person and a not-so-slow moving train. This was going to 
	be a long night...
	<br><br>
	After months and months and 14 minutes of waiting, James finally rocked up in Paddington on a cool day in December. With only 
	so much as a "how are you" from Matthew, he started to run off to the other end of the station. Matthew's connection was in 2 
	minutes, and civilties were not going to delay NT! James straggled behind as Matthew <s>weaved</s> teleported through the crowds,     
	towards the <s>TfL Rail</s> Cross-Purp_Liz train. And so it began.
	<br><br>
	Heading towards the sweet spot, away from normal people, we sat down and were horrified by the new in-carriage signing, before 
	the train pulled out of the station, and we headed towards the hotel. Along the way, we ticked off the shithole that is Acton Main 
	Line (Which had appeared in a Geoff Marshall video only 3 days prior), before pulling into Ealing Broadway for our first picture 
	of the day:
	</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Ealing Broadway.jpg" width="70%"></center><br>
	<p>
	We then walked to James's hotel room, where he unloaded his stuff, and we headed back to the tube station, to take the Central 
	Line to North Acton. We headed to Matthew's flat, saw his kitchen, and sat in his room watching KBuzz and RTom lectures for an hour, 
	including a marvellous proof that all triangles are equilateral! Now we can prove Fermat's Last Theorem, and that 0=1!
	<br><br>
	Intending to head to Twinings, we then set off, even though it was already dark, and simulated Matthew's morning commute to Queensway. 
	We did not, however, run through Hyde Park (we did, however, get kicked out). We then walked down to Huxley, and saw Clore, the MLC 
	and the MCR, where we had a long conversation about the fake subjects in Imperial, like DesEng, Chemistry and Medicine. If you 
	can't prove it in L&#x2203;&#x2200;N, it isn't true! (Unless it obeys Adam's Lau: Trivial &#x21D2; True). At half 6, we left Huxley 
	to see the fake subjects in person, before exiting onto Exhibition Road and disappearing into the subway. It was time for trains!
	<br><br>
	At this point we noticed that it was half past 6. Our destination, Twinings, closed at 7. This was an issue. And as with any 
	temporal problem, Matthew had a solution...
	</p>
	<center><p>Fucking run!!!!</p></center>
	<p>
	So we accelerated all the way down the tunnel, cutting up the gormless tourists who were going to delay us <i>Matthew: They are 
	everywhere! Everywhere, I tell you! They wait for me to arrive so they had try and <strong>tap out</strong> with their paper 
	tickets! Aaaaaaaa!</i> However, we made it, and caught a District train eastwards to Temple, jumping on and off at every stop as 
	per usual. NT was now in motion! 
	<br><br>
	We ran out of the station, looked at each other briefly, before Matthew sprinted up the street towards the strand, as we only 
	had 6 minutes until Twinings shut. We sprinted across the street and another lane, without checking for traffic, before running 
	straight past Twinings, getting lost, and slowly retracing our steps. We eventually found it, pointed through the door as the employee 
	shook his head angrily. They were closed. Well then. (James later went to Twinings to buy China Rose tea on that Sunday)
	<br><br>
	Dejected, we headed along the Strand, and onto Fleet Street. Walking down the street was like going back in time. The buildings 
	became successively older and more prestigious, and we passed ever more important landmarks, including the first Barclays, the favourite 
	pub of numerous literati and, most importantly of course, the world's only McDonalds To Go... because McDonalds isn't to go anyway? 
	As Fleet Street curved southward,  St Pauls loomed large in our view as we entered the City proper, complete with custom bollards and 
	lampposts. We passed the majesty of St Pauls, before walking along Cannon Street, and then up to the Bank of England.
	<br><br>
	James was clearly in heaven. There was such an overwhelming concentration of power and of nuttiness (we passed a huge development 
	called 1 Poultry, for God's sake!) that he started crossing the road randomly and claiming that he could commit crimes and get away 
	with them by impersonating Ms Jones! This was silly. Everyone knows that the way to get away with crime is to distinctly remember 
	being in Pizza Express in Woking at the time.
	<br>
	Which, of course, is where we were. Deffo.
	<br><br>
	We went through City: Dark Mode, and went up Threadneedle St to witness the reason that Matthew had dragged James on such a long 
	walk: the huge fungoid agglutination of glass and steel piercing accusingly through the starry heavens - the City's central 
	mass of skyscrapers in Bishopsgate, all huddled close together, seemingly intertwined and contorted like a titanic troupe of acrobats. 
	We stood in their shadow, between 22 Bishopsgate, the Gherkin, St Helens and the Cheesegrater, staring up at the sliver of black 
	sky hemmed in on all sides by walls of glass, reflecting nothing but the inky blackness above.
	<br><br>
	These towering skyscrapers, almost 300m high, were enough to terrify poor country boy James, so we headed out, passing the Scalpel 
	and Lloyds, through the throngs of intoxicated bankers in Leadenhall Market, past the <s>giant death ray</s> Walkie Talkie, and a... 
	somewhat questionable building, to Monument station. We gazed up at the Monument to the Great Fire, reading the <i>huge</i> latin 
	inscriptions on each side (each was about as large as a house!), which made James very happy. We then continued to wander southward, 
	towards the Thames. We then chanced upon a dodgy staircase, leading up to a dodgy aerial alleyway. We followed it to the end, 
	and stumbled across a wonderful panorama of the Thames, from Canary Wharf in the East to Battersea in the West. What a great end to 
	our time in the City.
	<br><br>
	We then headed back to Monument, and descended deep into the bowels of the mega-station, Bank-Monument, right down to the very bottom 
	at the DLR platforms, the deepest such on the entire network. James sprinted down the escalator, but was forced to the right to 
	allow the even faster Matthew to throw himself down, 2 steps at a time! We ran onto the train, grabbed seats at the very front, and 
	settled into the rollercoaster ride that the driverless DLR can be!
	<br><br>
	With Matthew having only had 1 minor crisis on the DLR, we headed down to Canary Wharf, a palatial station with a series of red-
	and-gold faux wrought iron arches, and a pristine glass roof, all nestled snugly between 2 imposing towers. Along the way, the track 
	and curved left and right, undulated up and down at extreme gradients, and we'd had front row seats the whole way. We saw London 
	light up as night set in ever deeper, yet we knew we were only beginning.
	<br><br>
	Canary Wharf is a weird station. It is a very weird station indeed, as the Jubilee line line platforms are a stupid distance, longer 
	than an OSI distance, away from the DLR platforms, and the Elizabeth line platforms, when they open next century, will be just as 
	far away from both of them. The three are connected by a huge shopping centre, and having gotten lost only once, we eventually found 
	our way out, and found the gaping steel maw of the Jubilee station greeting us in the middle of a public square. We descended inside, 
	passed through the line of ticket barriers (whereupon James discovered that he had in fact not tapped in at SK - the curse of that 
	evil station had struck again! Matthew: Damned Tourists!), and descended yet further to the platform. I say platform, I mean underground 
	cathedral. It was gargantuan! We didn't have time to admire its cavernous interior, save the roundels and the distant ceiling, because 
	our train soon pulled up behind the protective screens, and we hopped on.
	<br><br>
	Now it was back to classic NT. At every station we hopped off, took a photo of the roundel, and jumped back on, much to the confusion 
	and ire of our fellow passengers. Each station on the line has a unique styling of steel and concrete, giving every station an 
	individual sci-fi look and feel, which is awesome to see first-hand. The line took us through these stations all the way through Waterloo 
	to Westminister, where we alighted, for Westminster is the crowning glory of the Jubilee line extension. Firstly though, we took 
	our picture in front of the temporary roundel on the platform:
	</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Westminster.jpg" width="70%"></center><br>
	<p>
	We then began the long ascent up numerous escalators to the surface world. Westminster station is famous for its towering atrium, almost 
	50m high, filled with steel pipes and concrete balconies, alongside criss-crossing stairwells and entangled escalators, all plunging 
	into the deep abyss below, and stretching up into the heavens. Freya had <a href="./aleph.html">previously remarked</a> that it 
	looked like a setting from a sci-fi first person shooter, and the scale and ethos of the station didn't fail to awe James either! 
	<br><br>
	We then went above ground to briefly see Big Ben, enshrouded in a blanket of scaffolding, tarpulin and mizzle, before returning to 
	the station, to catch the much shallower Circle line to Gloucester Road, one of Matthew's favourite stations, and the closest 
	one to his college. Along the way, we were able to experience one of the idiosyncrasies of our new tube rules: despite having already 
	covered this track and visited the stations, we had to do so again, as we were now riding on a different line. Stopping off at 
	St James Park, Victoria, Sloane Square and SK, we arrived at the gorgeous Gloucester Road, to head to Pizza Express there, one of 
	our old NT traditions.
	<br><br>
	Located in a swanky bit of Brompton, the Pizza Express did not disappoint. As usual, James went for the pizza with the coolest name, 
	which was, unusually, a good choice this time. Even more unusually, Matthew splashed out on the same pizza, having been reduced to 
	90p ready meals and pasta for an entire term. We both chose Pollo ad Astra, which was an exceptionally nice pizza. Even more 
	unusually, we also had dessert! Now rather full, we set out once more - the night was still young!
	<br<br>
	Next on the menu was the District line Wimbledon branch, although we only did Earl's Court and West Brompton, before impulsively 
	alighting, tapping the pink validator, and switching platforms to catch the Overground north again. This didn't go particularly 
	smoothly though, due to the drizzle and the low frequency of Overground trains, which Matthew always forgets. We eventually caught 
	the train, stopped off at Olympia, before alighting at Shepherds Bush, having started the North London Line.
	<br><br>
	Here we have one of our classically painful NT moments. We walked down the platform towards a specific, special roundel, 
	and waited for a teenage couple to vacate the space in front of the roundel, which we required. This was not happening. She was 
	standing there chatting idly on her phone, and he was just loitering around. So, being the normal, regular humans that we are, we 
	also stood there, directly in front of them, half protected by a flying viaduct, but half drenched by the drizzle, staring at them. 
	<strong>Directly at them.</strong> After about 5 minutes of staring them down, they became sufficiently unnerved to move, 
	allowing us to take our picture and depart at last:
	</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Shepherd's Bush.jpg" width="70%"></center><br>
	<p>
	By depart, I mean cross the road (by running across the path of buses leaving Westfield) to the other Shepherd's Bush station, to catch 
	the central line once more. We descended into the warren of corridors with peeling paint, caught our train and actually sat back until 
	we entered virgin territory at Lancaster Gate, whereupon we fired up the nuttiness once more. This didn't last for too long though, as 
	James requested we see Marble Arch. Once again, we surfaced, exited the station via a piss-filled subway, and ended up in the middle 
	of a large, smog-filled roundabout at the end of Oxford Street... and I guess that Marble Arch was there too. We retreated back inside 
	from the smell of diesel fumes (yum), and continued on our journey to the insanely busy interchange of Oxford Circus.
	<br><br>
	Our interchanges now began to accelerate. We switched to the old-timey Bakerloo trains, which have been running since 1972, complete 
	with their Sherlock Holmes-type moquette, 70s interior and dedicated guard positions, and rode the line down to Embankment. Here, 
	we switched again to the Northern line, and reversed direction, back the way we came, towards the Central line once more. The Northern 
	line is dirty, loud and disgusting, even by tube standards. The disembodied announcer snidely barked orders at the hapless passengers 
	waiting on the platform: "MIND... THE GAP" in a disaffected upper class sneer, as the blackened train screamed its way down the tunnel 
	into the platform. The train was brought to a halt, and the doors ground open, allowing us to enter the grimy sauna inside. The 
	doors were dragged shut, the engine choked and rumbled into life, groaning so loudly that all conversation, even at shouting levels, 
	was impossible. Nevertheless, we hurtled down the tunnel, brakes squealing each time we entered a station, back towards London's aortal 
	central line.
	<br><br>
        Having jumped off the screaming Northern train at Tottenham Court Road at 11pm, laughing insanely, Matthew decided to sprint 
	through a 1 foot wide gap at the edge of the platform, between a slow person and a not-so-slow moving train. This was going to 
	be a long night...
	<br><br>
	Once again, we caught the central line (narrowing avoiding someone Matthew knew from college), and headed merely one stop 
	eastward to Holborn before alighting again. We paced up and down the platform to find a suitable roundel to take a picture in 
	front of, but people were blocking them all. To our disappointment, we changed to the Piccadilly and continued north for 2 stops. 
	The Piccadilly line, with its dodgy electrical circuits brought back memories of home, pacers, and our very first NT trip. Except 
	this time, instead of hurtling alongside a cliff-face on a screaming pacer in the pouring rain, with the dodgy flickering light 
	of the pacer providing our only illumination against the inky blackness of the night, we were instead deep under Central London in 
	a screaming tube train, but still with the dodgy flickering lights of the train providing our only illumination against the inky 
	blackness of the tunnel. The similarities went deeper. Doors on both trains would be randomly caught by the wind and would open 
	mid-journey, no matter how fast the train was going. Even more worryingly, the drivers on both trains like to open the doors at 
	stations before the train actually pulls to a stop. Fun times.
	<br><br>
	At Kings Cross, therefore, we jumped off the moving Piccadilly train, and entered the mega-station complex at Kings's Cross-St 
	Pancras. We wandered along the immense corridor, betwixt aisles of two-storey shops, amongst the towering Christmas trees, 
	themselves appearing dwarven in comparison to the station roof arching above our heads. We also passed a series of pianos and 
	accompanying pianists, their melodies intertwining in the night air. We navigated through the station, resurfaced briefly to 
	allow James to get some fresh air, and as the clocks ticked ever closer towards midnight, we descended once more to the trains.
	<br><br>
	We then caught the Circle line, along its original 1863 section, to Baker Street. We passed the newly-immaculate Euston Square, 
	the absolutely filthy Great Portland Street, and ended up in Baker Street, the Met's original interchange for its multitudinous 
	lines. Baker Street is a really fascinating station, with 10 underground platforms (the most of any tube station), departures for 
	express Met services (which, to my knowledge are the only such examples of express tube services), iconic Circle/H&C platforms 
	with shafts cut into the ceiling, and the roof blackened by smoke, the Bakerloo platforms with the famous Sherlock Holmes mosaics, 
	and this archway, which we broke tradition for, and had our picture taken in front of it instead of the roundel:
	</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Baker Street.jpg" width="70%"></center><br>
	<p>
	After this, we passed a myriad of Sherlock Holmes mosaics on our descent to the Bakerloo platforms (whereupon we encountered yet 
	more mosaics), before boarding the train with its Sherlock Holmes-style moquette. We only went as far as Regent's Park before 
	alighting, running up the stairs, up the corridor to the outside world, and stepped out into the mizzle of Saturday morning, 
	illuminated by the acrid glow of Sodium lights. Having now been out for hours, our sanity finally snapped, and we started howling 
	with laughter as we jogged down the road to Great Portland Street once more. We waited for the Circle and H&C trains to pass on their 
	final run of the night, and then caught the final Met train, bound for Chesham.
	<br><br>
	It was now late. People were drunk. We were completely sober. Yet somehow, we were at greater risk of endangering ourselves than 
	anyone else... except perhaps the guy who was slumped unconscious against the train doors as they opened and almost fell out, into 
	the gap between the train and the platform. We weren't that bad. We merely stepped over him, because we had no idea what to do!
	<br><br>
	We headed to the front, grabbed a longitudinal seat (an anomaly on the tube), sat down and pulled out our crisps to complete our 
	checklist of traditions. We reached as far as zone 4, got off at Wembley Park, and then caught the final day Jubilee train back down 
	again, to tick off the missing stops. We leapt on and off, until Bond Street, when we caught the Central line back home.
	<br><br>
	By this point we were almost asleep, so Matthew got off at North Acton, to head to bed, whilst James returned to his Premier Inn 
	in Ealing. By the time he got home, it was almost 2am. Jesus Christ, this had been a long NT adventure, but oh my God it was worth it!

<p>       This second adventure is very much work in progress, as we will have to see how NT &#x3D9;1 works first, but James will 
	  be returning to London after Christmas, on 11th and 12th Jan, so we intend to start 2020 off right, with some NT 
	  nuttiness. Cue more incoherent screaming from James about how busy amazing everything is, and more inaudible mutterings from 
	  Matthew about how the Circle line is delayed again. This may well be our biggest adventure yet, as it may last 2 whole days!
