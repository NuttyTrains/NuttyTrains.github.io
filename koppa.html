<p>       Koppa Adventures: coming soon to a tube platform near you! As mentioned on <a href="./index.html"> our 
	  main page </a>, the Koppa (&#x3D9;) adventures on the tube/TfL network will follow different rules to usual. We have 
	  only recently started university, so we have yet to undertake any adventures yet, but this has been planned for many 
	  months. London is uniquely suited to NT adventures due to the frequency of services and density of stations, so our 
	  first adventure here should be optime!

<div class="content">
<p>       We have actually yet to start the Koppa Adventures, because it turns out that maths degrees take a lot of time and 
	  effort! Fortunately, James is coming to London on 13th Dec, meaning that we will have a chance to undertake NT &#x3D9;I, 
	  and test out our new Tube Rules. We will most likely travel from Paddington on the old-fashioned Bakerloo line, then 
	  cover the Circle-District line from there towards Temple, for we have the Twinings shop to pay a visit to! On the way 
	  back, we intend to pay a visit to the Jubilee line station at Westminster. Unfortunately, James will be travelling to 
	  Tab later that day, meaning this adventure will be cut reasonably short, but we will have enough time to navigate the 
	  our way around the Tube, try some nice tea, and have a jolly good laugh. Hopefully.
	  <br><br>
	  So, James has gone to absolute pits and now is a big twitter enthusiast, he has created a twitter with associated twitter 
	  bot, this was what he was doing all the way up to London. Find it <a href="">here</a>...

<div class="content">
<p>       This second adventure is very much work in progress, as we will have to see how NT &#x3D9;1 works first, but James will 
	  be returning to London after Christmas, on 11th and 12th Jan, so we intend to start 2020 off right, with some NT 
	  nuttiness. Cue more incoherent screaming from James about how busy amazing everything is, and more inaudible mutterings from 
	  Matthew about how the Circle line is delayed again. This may well be our biggest adventure yet, as it may last 2 whole days!
