<p>       Koppa Adventures: coming soon to a tube platform near you! As mentioned on <a href="./index.html"> our 
	  main page </a>, the Koppa (&#x3D9;) adventures on the tube/TfL network will follow different rules to usual. We have 
	  only recently started university, so we will be unable to undertake these frequently, but this has been planned for many 
	  months. London is uniquely suited to NT adventures due to the frequency of services and density of stations, so our 
	  adventures here should be optime!
	  <br><br>
	  So, James has gone to absolute pits and now is a big twitter enthusiast, he has created a twitter with associated twitter 
	  bot, this was what he was doing all the way up to London. Find it <a href="https://twitter.com/NuttyTrains">here</a>...

<div class="content">
<p>     Having jumped off the screaming Northern train at Tottenham Court Road at 11pm, laughing insanely, Matthew decided to sprint 
	through a 1 foot wide gap at the edge of the platform, between a slow person and a not-so-slow moving train. This was going to 
	be a long night...
	<br><br>
	After months and months and 14 minutes of waiting, James finally rocked up in Paddington on a cool day in December. With only 
	so much as a "how are you" from Matthew, he started to run off to the other end of the station. Matthew's connection was in 2 
	minutes, and civilties were not going to delay NT! James straggled behind as Matthew <s>weaved</s> teleported through the crowds,     
	towards the <s>TfL Rail</s> Cross-Purp-Liz train. And so it began.
	<br><br>
	Heading towards the sweet spot, away from normal people, we sat down and were horrified by the new in-carriage signing, before 
	the train pulled out of the station, and we headed towards the hotel. Along the way, we ticked off the shithole that is Acton Main 
	Line (Which had appeared in a Geoff Marshall video only 3 days prior), before pulling into Ealing Broadway for our first picture 
	of the day:
	</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Ealing Broadway.jpg" width="70%"></center><br>
	<p>
	We then walked to James's hotel room, where he unloaded his stuff, and we headed back to the tube station, to take the Central 
	Line to North Acton. We headed to Matthew's flat, saw his kitchen, and sat in his room watching KBuzz and RTom lectures for an hour, 
	including a marvellous proof that all triangles are equilateral! Now we can prove Fermat's Last Theorem, and that 0=1!
	<br><br>
	Intending to head to Twinings, we then set off, even though it was already dark, and simulated Matthew's morning commute to Queensway. 
	We did not, however, run through Hyde Park (but got kicked out when trying to nick Boris bikes). We then walked down to Huxley, and saw 
	Clore, the MLC and the MCR, where we had a long conversation about the fake subjects in Imperial, like DesEng, Chemistry and Medicine. 
	If you can't prove it in L&#x2203;&#x2200;N, it isn't true! (Unless it obeys Adam's Lau: Trivial &#x21D2; True). We got some of the 
	famed Huxley coffee before leaving Huxley at half 6, to see the fake subjects in person, before exiting onto Exhibition Road and 
	disappearing into the subway. It was time for trains!
	<br><br>
	At this point we noticed that it was half past 6. Our destination, Twinings, closed at 7. This was an issue. And as with any 
	temporal problem, Matthew had a solution...
	</p>
	<center><p>Fucking run!!!!</p></center>
	<p>
	So we accelerated all the way down the tunnel, cutting up the gormless tourists who were going to delay us <i>Matthew: They are 
	everywhere! Everywhere, I tell you! They wait for me to arrive so they had try and <strong>tap out</strong> with their paper 
	tickets! Aaaaaaaa!</i> However, we made it, and caught a District train eastwards to Temple, jumping on and off at every stop as 
	per usual. NT was now in motion! 
	<br><br>
	We ran out of the station, looked at each other briefly, before Matthew sprinted up the street towards the strand, as we only 
	had 6 minutes until Twinings shut. We sprinted across the street and another lane, without checking for traffic, before running 
	straight past Twinings, getting lost, and slowly retracing our steps. We eventually found it, pointed through the door as the employee 
	shook his head angrily. They were closed. Well then. (James later went to Twinings to buy China Rose tea on that Sunday, but sadly, 
	this is now discontinued :(
	<br><br>
	Dejected, we headed along the Strand, and onto Fleet Street. Walking down the street was like going back in time. The buildings 
	became successively older and more prestigious, and we passed ever more important landmarks, including the first Barclays, the favourite 
	pub of numerous literati and, most importantly of course, the world's only McDonalds To Go... because McDonalds isn't to go anyway? 
	As Fleet Street curved southward,  St Pauls loomed large in our view as we entered the City proper, complete with custom bollards and 
	lampposts. We passed the majesty of St Pauls, before walking along Cannon Street, and then up to the Bank of England.
	<br><br>
	James was clearly in heaven. There was such an overwhelming concentration of power and of nuttiness (we passed a huge development 
	called 1 Poultry, for God's sake!) that he started crossing the road randomly and claiming that he could commit crimes and get away 
	with them by impersonating Menna! This was silly. Everyone knows that the way to get away with crime is to distinctly remember 
	being in Pizza Express in Woking at the time.
	<br>
	Which, of course, is where we were. Deffo.
	<br><br>
	We went through City: Dark Mode, and went up Threadneedle St to witness the reason that Matthew had dragged James on such a long 
	walk: the huge fungoid agglutination of glass and steel piercing accusingly through the starry heavens - the City's central 
	mass of skyscrapers in Bishopsgate, all huddled close together, seemingly intertwined and contorted like a titanic troupe of acrobats. 
	We stood in their shadow, between 22 Bishopsgate, the Gherkin, St Helens and the Cheesegrater, staring up at the sliver of black 
	sky hemmed in on all sides by walls of glass, reflecting nothing but the inky blackness above.
	<br><br>
	These towering skyscrapers, almost 300m high, were enough to terrify poor country boy James, so we headed out under the increasing 
	gaze of the gathering throng of angry security guards, passing the Scalpel and Lloyds, through the throngs of intoxicated bankers in 
	Leadenhall Market, past the <s>giant death ray</s> Walkie Talkie, and a... somewhat questionable building, to Monument station. We 
	gazed up at the Monument to the Great Fire, reading the <i>huge</i> latin inscriptions on each side (each was about as large as a 
	house!), which made James very happy. We then continued to wander southward, towards the Thames. We then chanced upon a dodgy 
	staircase, leading up to a dodgy aerial alleyway. We followed it to the end, and stumbled across a wonderful panorama of the Thames, 
	from Canary Wharf in the East to Battersea in the West. What a great end to our time in the City.
	<br><br>
	We then headed back to Monument, and descended deep into the bowels of the mega-station, Bank-Monument, right down to the very bottom 
	at the DLR platforms, the deepest such on the entire network. James sprinted down the escalator, but was forced to the right to 
	allow the even faster Matthew to throw himself down, 2 steps at a time! We ran onto the train, grabbed seats at the very front, and 
	settled into the rollercoaster ride that the driverless DLR can be!
	<br><br>
	With Matthew having only had 1 minor crisis on the DLR, almost losing his pen, we headed down to Canary Wharf, a palatial station with 
	a series of red-and-gold faux wrought iron arches, and a pristine glass roof, all nestled snugly between 2 imposing towers. Along the 
	way, the track and curved left and right, undulated up and down at extreme gradients, and we'd had front row seats the whole way. We saw 
	London light up as night set in ever deeper, yet we knew we were only beginning.
	<br><br>
	Canary Wharf is a weird station. It is a very weird station indeed, as the Jubilee line platforms are a stupid distance, longer 
	than an OSI distance, away from the DLR platforms, and the Elizabeth line platforms, when they open next century, will be just as 
	far away from both of them. The three are connected by a huge shopping centre, and having gotten lost only once, we eventually found 
	our way out, and found the gaping steel maw of the Jubilee station greeting us in the middle of a public square. We descended inside, 
	passed through the line of ticket barriers (whereupon James discovered that he had in fact not tapped in at SK - the curse of that 
	evil station had struck again! Matthew: Damned Tourists!), and descended yet further to the platform. I say platform, I mean underground 
	cathedral. It was gargantuan! We didn't have time to admire its cavernous interior, save the roundels and the distant ceiling, because 
	our train soon pulled up behind the protective screens, and we hopped on.
	<br><br>
	Now it was back to classic NT. At every station we hopped off, took a photo of the roundel, and jumped back on, much to the confusion 
	and ire of our fellow passengers. Each station on the line has a unique styling of steel and concrete, giving every station an 
	individual sci-fi look and feel, which is awesome to see first-hand. The line took us through these stations all the way through Waterloo 
	to Westminister, where we alighted, for Westminster is the crowning glory of the Jubilee line extension. Firstly though, we took 
	our picture in front of the temporary roundel on the platform:
	</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Westminster.jpg" width="70%"></center><br>
	<p>
	We then began the long ascent up numerous escalators to the surface world. Westminster station is famous for its towering atrium, almost 
	50m high, filled with steel pipes and concrete balconies, alongside criss-crossing stairwells and entangled escalators, all plunging 
	into the deep abyss below, and stretching up into the heavens. Freya had <a href="./aleph.html">previously remarked</a> that it 
	looked like a setting from a sci-fi first person shooter, and the scale and ethos of the station didn't fail to awe James either! 
	<br><br>
	We then went above ground to briefly see Big Ben, enshrouded in a blanket of scaffolding, tarpulin and mizzle, before returning to 
	the station, to catch the much shallower Circle line to Gloucester Road, one of Matthew's favourite stations, and the closest 
	one to his college. By this point, the smog was beginning to get to James, and he was finding it increasingly hard to breathe. 
	Along the way, we were able to experience one of the idiosyncrasies of our new tube rules: despite having already 
	covered this track and visited the stations, we had to do so again, as we were now riding on a different line. Stopping off at 
	St James Park, Victoria, Sloane Square and SK, we arrived at the gorgeous Gloucester Road, to head to Pizza Express there, one of 
	our old NT traditions.
	<br><br>
	Located in a swanky bit of Brompton, the Pizza Express did not disappoint (and was directly opposite James's client). As usual, 
	James went for the pizza with the coolest name, which was, unusually, a good choice this time. Even more unusually, Matthew splashed 
	out on the same pizza, having been reduced to 90p ready meals and pasta for an entire term. We both chose Pollo ad Astra, which was 
	an exceptionally nice pizza. Even more unusually, we also had dessert! Now rather full, we set out once more - the night was still young!
	<br><br>
	Next on the menu was the District line Wimbledon branch, although we only did Earl's Court and West Brompton, before impulsively 
	alighting, tapping the pink validator, and switching platforms to catch the Overground north again. This didn't go particularly 
	smoothly though, due to the drizzle and the low frequency of Overground trains, which Matthew always forgets. We eventually caught 
	the train and stopped off at Olympia, starting the North London Line. On the way, we met 
	some very interesting human wildlife. Stood/seated directly next to us was a group of female students, absolutely pissed off their 
	tits. They were swaying back and forth and falling on the floor even when the train was stationary! To make matters infinitely worse, 
	they were loudly singing Christmas songs, dressed in far too little than was sensible for 10pm on a mid-December night, and 
	attempting to get the entire carriage to join in. Eheu! However, in the story of Matthew's life, even though they were too drunk 
	to stand without falling, speak without slurring or to know where they were, to where they were going, or even who they were, they 
	were still sober enough to not even attempt to get stone-faced Matthew to participate in a drunk Christmas sing-a-long!
	<br><br>
	We then alighted at Shepherds Bush, and it was here we had one of our classically painful NT moments. We walked down the platform 
	towards a specific, special roundel, and waited for a teenage couple to vacate the space in front of the roundel, which we required.
	This was not happening. She was standing there chatting idly on her phone, and he was just loitering around. So, being the normal, 
	regular humans that we are, we also stood there, directly in front of them, half protected by a flying viaduct, but half drenched by 
	the drizzle, staring at them. <strong>Directly at them.</strong> After about 5 minutes of staring them down, they became sufficiently 
	unnerved to move, allowing us to take our picture and depart at last:
	</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Shepherd's Bush.jpg" width="70%"></center><br>
	<p>
	By depart, I mean cross the road (by running across the path of buses leaving Westfield) to the other Shepherd's Bush station, to catch 
	the central line once more. We descended into the warren of corridors with peeling paint, caught our train and actually sat back until 
	we entered virgin territory at Lancaster Gate, whereupon we fired up the nuttiness once more. This didn't last for too long though, as 
	James requested we see Marble Arch because he was now completely unable to breathe. Once again, we surfaced, exited the station via a 
	piss-filled subway, and ended up in the middle of a large, smog-filled roundabout at the end of Oxford Street... and I guess that 
	Marble Arch was there too. We retreated back inside from the smell of diesel fumes (yum) after James found he couldn't breathe on the 
	surface either, and continued on our journey to the insanely busy interchange of Oxford Circus.
	<br><br>
	Our interchanges now began to accelerate. We switched to the old-timey Bakerloo trains, which have been running since 1972, complete 
	with their Sherlock Holmes-type moquette, 70s interior and dedicated guard positions, and rode the line down to Embankment. Here, 
	we switched again to the Northern line, and reversed direction, back the way we came, towards the Central line once more. The Northern 
	line is dirty, loud and disgusting, even by tube standards. The disembodied announcer snidely barked orders at the hapless passengers 
	waiting on the platform: "MIND... THE GAP" in a disaffected upper class sneer, as the blackened train screamed its way down the tunnel 
	into the platform. The train was brought to a halt, and the doors ground open, allowing us to enter the grimy sauna inside. The 
	doors were dragged shut, the engine choked and rumbled into life, groaning so loudly that all conversation, even at shouting levels, 
	was impossible. Nevertheless, we hurtled down the tunnel, brakes squealing each time we entered a station, back towards London's aortal 
	central line.
	<br><br>
        Having jumped off the screaming Northern train at Tottenham Court Road at 11pm, laughing insanely, Matthew decided to sprint 
	through a 1 foot wide gap at the edge of the platform, between a slow person and a not-so-slow moving train. This was going to 
	be a long night...
	<br><br>
	Once again, we caught the central line (narrowing avoiding someone Matthew knew from college), and headed merely one stop 
	eastward to Holborn before alighting again. We paced up and down the platform to find a suitable roundel to take a picture in 
	front of, but people were blocking them all. To our disappointment, we changed to the Piccadilly and continued north for 2 stops. 
	The Piccadilly line, with its dodgy electrical circuits brought back memories of home, pacers, and our very first NT trip. Except 
	this time, instead of hurtling alongside a cliff-face on a screaming pacer in the pouring rain, with the dodgy flickering light 
	of the pacer providing our only illumination against the inky blackness of the night, we were instead deep under Central London in 
	a screaming tube train, but still with the dodgy flickering lights of the train providing our only illumination against the inky 
	blackness of the tunnel. The similarities went deeper. Doors on both trains would be randomly caught by the wind and would open 
	mid-journey, no matter how fast the train was going. Even more worryingly, the drivers on both trains like to open the doors at 
	stations before the train actually pulls to a stop. Fun times. <i>It's just like home!!</i>
	<br><br>
	At Kings Cross, therefore, we jumped off the moving Piccadilly train, and entered the mega-station complex at Kings's Cross-St 
	Pancras. We wandered along the immense corridor, betwixt aisles of two-storey shops, amongst the towering Christmas trees, 
	themselves appearing dwarven in comparison to the station roof arching above our heads. We also passed a series of pianos and 
	accompanying pianists, their melodies intertwining in the night air. We navigated through the station, resurfaced briefly to 
	allow James to get some fresh air, and as the clocks ticked ever closer towards midnight, we descended once more to the trains.
	<br><br>
	We then caught the Circle line, along its original 1863 section, to Baker Street. We passed the newly-immaculate Euston Square, 
	the absolutely filthy Great Portland Street, and ended up in Baker Street, the Met's original interchange for its multitudinous 
	lines. Baker Street is a really fascinating station, with 10 underground platforms (the most of any tube station), departures for 
	express Met services (which, to my knowledge are the only such examples of express tube services), iconic Circle/H&C platforms 
	with shafts cut into the ceiling, and the roof blackened by smoke, the Bakerloo platforms with the famous Sherlock Holmes mosaics, 
	and this archway, which we broke tradition for, and had our picture taken in front of it instead of the roundel:
	</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Baker Street.jpg" width="70%"></center><br>
	<p>
	After this, we passed a myriad of Sherlock Holmes mosaics on our descent to the Bakerloo platforms (whereupon we encountered yet 
	more mosaics), before boarding the train with its Sherlock Holmes-style moquette. We only went as far as Regent's Park before 
	alighting, running up the stairs, up the corridor to the outside world, and stepped out into the mizzle of Saturday morning, 
	illuminated by the acrid glow of Sodium lights. Having now been out for hours, our sanity finally snapped, and we started howling 
	with laughter as we jogged down the road to Great Portland Street once more. We waited for the Circle and H&C trains to pass on their 
	final run of the night, and then caught the final Met train, bound for Chesham.
	<br><br>
	It was now late. People were drunk. We were completely sober. Yet somehow, we were at greater risk of endangering ourselves than 
	anyone else... except perhaps the guy who was slumped unconscious against the train doors as they opened and almost fell out, into 
	the gap between the train and the platform. He was maybe kind of worse. We weren't that bad. We merely stepped over him, because 
	we weren't going to <i>help</i> people!
	<br><br>
	We headed to the front, grabbed a longitudinal seat (an anomaly on the tube), sat down and pulled out our crisps to complete our 
	checklist of traditions. We reached as far as zone 4, got off at Wembley Park, and then caught the final day Jubilee train back down 
	again, to tick off the missing stops. We leapt on and off, until Bond Street, when made our final change to the central line.
	<br><br>
	We had to wait almost 20 mins for a night tube service that went all the way to Ealing Broadway, in which time we saw multiple mice 
	on the platform. We finally boarded the Ealing train, which was mostly full, to James's great surprise. We settled in for the final leg. 
	By this point we were almost asleep, so Matthew got off at North Acton, to head to bed, whilst James returned to his Premier Inn 
	in Ealing to sit at the bar and get pissed. By the time he got home, it was almost 2am. This had been an exceptionally long adventure, 
	but only a taste of what was to come...

	<p>
	Koppa 2 started early on Friday afternoon, as Matthew spent most of the afternoon tracking James's journey through chocky city.
	After only a minor delay in getting his stuff printed, Matthew took the District and Jubilee lines to Waterloo to meet James for yet more nuttiness!
	We met in Waterloo (but not under the station clock), and James showed off his new power-walking skills. We went down the escalator to the Jubilee line, into 
	the abyss, and went to Green Park, where we did the walk of death, weaving in and out of all the normal people going at half the speed. It should be noted that James had
	a very heavy bag on him with all his Uni things and this stuff for the weekend, this was not unknown to the people passing by as anybody either too small was knocked clean 
	unconscious from the heft or was bent double as the mass was thrusted into their stomach. Due to a problem on the Central line, and because Matthew was too impatient to wait 
	any more than 30 seconds for a train, we took the Piccadilly to Acton Town, being absolutely rammed into the carriage full of commuters heading home. James started laughing insanely, 
	as we were squeezed in tighter than he'd ever been before on a train. Amongst the commuters was a couple making out and giving slobbery kisses to one another, right up close to 
	everyone else's faces, to everyone else's disdain. If it wasn't totally illeagal James would have happily gave them the same fate as the poor Child on the walk of death (which lived up
	to it's name, finally). Noice. There was also a very angry Polish guy who seemed to be making death threats over the phone. What an introduction to London! We then changed to the 
	District for Ealing Broadway. 
	<br><br>
	Matthew then went home to do some chores whilst James went to the Premier Inn, to join Matthew at just gone 7. We then watched some of each others' lectures 
	(RTom and P<sup>3</sup>, now that James had embraced the joys of Panopto and was no longer attending uni in person (apart from to make fun of his lecturers, 
	including MO, who believed that numbers stopped at 12.), and looked at each other's problem sheets before heading out at half 8. We took the Central line all
	the way to St Pauls, passed the stock exchange at Paternoster Square, and went to Wagamamas, where we had spicy (but cold) katsu curry, pad thai, and dishwater, 
	upmarketed to be called 'Green Tea' (I see this is a case for Trading Standards). Honestly, what on earth was that 'green tea'? The Nutty Trains twitter account 
	made it very clear to our n followers that this was very displeasing. We left at half 10, and <s>Matthew</s> calculated that we had enough time to squeeze in an 
	extra loop before Brexit hour, and so began the madness!

	We took the Central line 1 stop to Bank, whereupon we ran through the commuters like maniacs, running down the escalators, pushing one another (James 
	ending up tumbling down the stairs), before then changing to the W&C (which was very sweet, albeit loud), heading along the entire length of the line to 
	Waterloo (completing the first tube line). At this point 11pm was closing in rapidly and James was starting to worry. He wanted to be out on the Thames 
	for when we left the EU. We ran up to the Bakerloo (James still checking the time on his phone and almost missing a ticket barrier in the process), 
	and caught the train to Embankment (Which I believe was the location of the Alice in Wonderland corridor, but I am probably wrong). We switched maniacally to the District 
	to Monument. At this point James was sure we were to miss it.<br><br>
	<blockquote> Get ready, we have to run </blockquote>
	<p>and as soon as those red doors opened we legged it. Across the platform pushing several old women and commuters out of the way. Turning left and up the stairs, 
	we were going to be there for Brexit. Up into the inky blackness of the smog we ran, tapping out like real commuters. We then ran over the flying pavement over a 
	busy road and almost slipping on the water or ice or just drudge that lied there. We then squeeled to a stop as we spiralled around and up towards the barbican-esque 
	viewing platform we now know oh so well. Arriving at a viewing balcony at 10.57pm, overlooking the Thames, Tower Bridge and the Shard for the exact time of Britain 
	leaving the EU. We reminisced about how long ago the referendum was (it predates Alpha 2!), including James's famous business powerpoint about Greece in the EU!
	</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Monument.jpg" width="70%"></center><br>
	<p>
	Deciding to keep clear of the huge crowds at Westminster, we then went back (after James did some vandalism, ripping off any pro-EU posters he saw, in 
	full view of any CCTV cameras (but don't worry, only his <strong>REDACTED</strong> friends were watching, long live Big Bwother uWu)), and took the District one stop 
	before it went out of service. We then took the Circle to Liverpool St, before switching to the Central to Stratford (which was a rammed train and 
	station, but only on the National Rail platforms, why?!?!? Wake up sheeple.). We then wandered through the Westfield Centre (accidentally passing an IKEA in Stratford - tick!).
	This place was massive, not like massive massive but massive. There were several gangs selling drugs, old dears smoking pot and knife crime all around. This was a nice place. To
	add salt into the wound that at this point James couldn't feel, there were huge columns with triangular flicky lights. These were of huge interest, but neither of us felt safe enough
	to stop and give them a good look. So we continued on to the Olympic Park, surely a safer area. We wanted to see how it had changed in the last 8 years, and found that it was completely 
	desolate and rather eerie. Some of the lesser-used (ie, non-football) stadiums were practically falling to pieces! After getting only slightly lost getting there and back and nearly 
	assaulted standing outside the football stadium, we went through the crowds of smokers and druggees outside the Westfield shopping centre (it felt just like home), before retreating 
	across a long bridge back to the (still busy) station. We then got back on the train, went one stop to Leyton for a ceremonial photo (Matthew regrets not having his top hat), before 
	returning home. Onto day 2!
	</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Leyton.jpg" width="70%"></center><br>
	<p>
	<emph> Addendum: James is <strong>hungry</strong></emph><br><br>
	James had just left Matthew and was on the train back to Ealing Broadway and his stomach, and throat, told him he was hungry and hadn't drunk anything for a good few hours. Ah, this was
	an amazing time to feel like this at, *checks phone*, 1:23am. Everything was shut and James left the station and started to wander down the road considering going into a bar and having a 
	pint to cease his hunger and thirst (he was rather delerious at this point). He then looked at the bouncer and he was staring him down, he didn't both and carried on walking down the road.
	James staggered, at this point his feet hurt, towards the hotel and say the golden light of the golden arches. His savior. God was real. This was the best course of action. He <s>entered</s> pushed past a group 
	of girls and their associated drugged up boyfriends / whatever they were at that point, one seemed to be a cat. They make spice different to how it is in Camborne. So he went over and ordered a 
	lemonade and something to eat. He then and went and stood away while the Bouncer approached James,<br><br>
	<strong> Bouncer </strong> (South London Accent) : You don't look drunk or drugged, you alright pal.<br>
	James : I'm good, just slightly insane.<br>
	<strong> Bouncer </strong> : Aren't we all pal? Aren't we all? <br>
	The bouncer went his way and James stood there waiting and idly watching a drunk young couple ordering and arguing about their 'meal'. James felt a light tapping on his shoulder, shocked by somebody 
	actually touching him, he turned around startled to see a slight girl, who also didn't seem to be drunk.<br><br>
	Girl : Hey, Mike said you weren't drunk.<br>
	James : Uhhh, well no. Why is that an important information<br>
	Girl: Well... <br>
	<blockquote> Order 81 </blockquote><br>
	<p>James scuttled off to get his food, never to see the girl again. He is inclined to mention he walked her home as she was literally just scared of the druggies and <emph> nothing else</emph> 
	(his unfound aceness made sure of that.)

	<!-- Addendum 2 : Parkrun -->
	Day 2 started much earlier, when James headed off to Parkrun (in Gunnersbury Park, Geoff's home turf), managing to get terribly lost whilst getting to and 
	from Parkrun on various busses. Matthew meanwhile had a load of chores to complete, and all was going flawlessly - until he tried to shop in Asda without his 
	wallet. Fantastic. We then met at Woodward, communicating via Twitter, and planned our course of action for the day. Here is a blast from the past, writing 
	this account towards the end of the first lockdown in early August: the UK's first 2 coronavirus cases had been detected only the previous day, and a third 
	Chinese tourist had been detained in Paddington due to having suspicious symptoms. Therefore, James was very worried about heading too near the station. He 
	clearly had better foresight than I, as I spent much of the morning laughing about it! (Quoting Matthew he only worried about COVID once he got kicked out of the MLC).
	<br><br>
	Trying to avoid Paddington to not get Coronavirus (henceforth referred to as "getting chocked"), we headed into London via the Central line, from North Acton 
	to NHG, changed to the District, and headed one stop south to Kensington High Street. There, we saw what must have been a miracle (either that, or TfL had 
	fucked the trains up again) - a rare train to Kensington Olympia! We immediately changed all our plans and took the train all of 2 stops to the crowning glory 
	of our tube station list:

	<p>
	This did leave us with a minor problem though - we had wanted to get food in Kensington High Street... which we had just departed from. "No problem" said 
	Matthew, "it is only a <strong>short</strong> walk!". Those, James would definitely realise by Sunday, were fateful words indeed. We walked over a <s>10</s>mile<s>s</s> to Pret, right at the 
	other end of the street, whereupon James bankrupted himself and Matthew blanched at the prices, before walking back, whilst James complained about Matthew's 
	poor perception of distance, and the general rudeness of Londoners and chomped on some soup which was more extensive than his house.
	<br><br>
	We took the slowverground to Willesden Junction, via Shepherd's Bush and over London's equivalent to the Neath Valley (the Westway, the Grand Union Canal, 
	2 mainline and another large road), wherupon we ran maniacally around the vast ludicrousness of the amalgam that is Willesden Junction (it is comprised of 
	3 small stations, all fused together via a system of long subways and flying corridors). We then doubled back on ourselves, back down the line to Richmond.
	</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Richmond.jpg" width="70%"></center><br>
	<p>
	In this time, James had been checking Twitter, and discovered that the #IKEAmeansIKEA challenge that had been rumoured to be taking place that day was indeed 
	happening: numerous transport/maths twitter accounts were aiming to visit every Ikea in London in a single day (or so we thought), and so we immediately 
	decided to take up the challenge, albeit from the slightly awkward starting point of Richmond. Fortunately, we realised we'd already been to one 
	at midnight, in Stratford! The others were lightweights! Ad Ikea! Adkea!

	<p>
	In the name of efficiency, we immediately turned on our heel and went back to Willesden Junction. Now, as we were clearly so awesome at this challenge, having 
	visited 1 our of n Ikeas by 15:00, we decided to take a (¬) quick detour, taking the Bakerloo to the end. This line was a bit strange, as we had to stop at 
	some random shitty (very Valleys-y) station in the middle of nowhere, with collapsing shelters and a strong smell of <s>canabis</s>>piss, just to continue to the end of the 
	line! Jumping on and off also nearly incurred the anger of some dodgy geezers sitting in the same rumbling carriage as us, as we run about the various 
	shitty stops on the line, it was at this point they brandished their knives. To try and mitigate the issue, Matthew offered to jump on and off for a few stations, and was in charge of photos with his 
	magnificent phone camera. The below 4K photo at is an example of his handicraft. We disembarked at Harrow and Wealdstone, and set 
	about walking through and getting lost in dodgy cul-de-sacs in Harrow. We trekked along the main road towards the town centre, whilst we admired the general 
	run-down nature of the area, and read up about the recent shootings and stabbings. Noice. Perhaps this wasn't too different to normal at all! It felt just 
	like the valleys, NT's spiritual home! 
	</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Harrow & Wealdstone.jpg" width="70%"></center><br>
	<p>
	Despite the local presitigious public school, this by no means dampened the Merthyr-esque ethos, nor our undying snobbery and disdain. After a brief detour 
	complaining about the prevalence of fast food chains (despite that conversation starting off with Matthew mentioning he had never before seen a Taco Bell, 
	like the one we passed in Harrow), we quickly found our way to the arse end of the town, stumbling across what was clearly a brothel. It may have said "nail 
	bar" or something or other, but we weren't fooled! We could clearly see, thanks to the ubiquitous gold glitter paint and streamers (as well as the dodgy, 
	shabby-looking backrooms), that this was absolutely a brothel. We truly have a habit for bringing out the best in places!
	<br><br>
	We briefly got lost trying to navigate around 3 houses, and got slightly distracted by some company plagiarising the clearly-trademarked MLC<sup>TM</sup>, 
	we finally reached Harrow-on-the-Hill station (which was set deep into a cutting, ironically), and waited on the island platform for yet another trip on the 
	Met! We caught the Met to King's Cross, luxuriating in the (rare) non-side seats, before we approached Neasden, the site of Ikea 2. Now, technically, the 
	Ikea challenge required us to visit _every_ Ikea, but Matthew moaned about this, saying that it was rather hard and awkward to walk to Neasden Ikea - 
	it wasn't really designed for public transport access after all. He proposed that as the tube line passed kind of close to the Ikea, we could say we visited 
	it... at high speed! And so it was. Passing Ikea at 60mph, we now had 2 Ikeas under our belt! Tick!

	We did however, notice that the other participants were purchasing what appeared to be random crap in each Ikea, so to make up for our... interesting visit 
	to Neasden, we resolved to get extra random crap at Meridian Water. The Met plunged underground before Baker Street, whereupon we continued subsurface until 
	King's Cross. We eventually snaked our way across the mammoth station, learning from our mistakes in Koppa 1, before hopping onto the Piccadilly line, trying 
	to avoid the rabid Arsenal fans, and continuing our routine of jumping on and off at every station, now perfected to an art of attempting to not incur the 
	misanthropic wrath of the Londoners.
	<br><br>
	We passed KBuzz's home station, Calendonian Road, and continued on the Piccadilly to Finsbury Park, before switching to the Victoria for the first time 
	for some high-frequency nuttiness. We flew up the line in no time at all (passing the station we actually needed), all the way to the end at Walthamstow 
	Central.

	We then doubled back to Tottenham Hale to catch an NR service to Meridian Premier IKEA Extra station. The tube was quick, and after a little confusion 
	regarding the detour signs outside the station, we arrived at the NR station, eagerly awaiting our train. We were going rogue - off the tube map! How 
	exciting! The Greater Anglia service was absolutely empty, and we had <strong>3 carriages</strong> to ourselves! We alighted only 2 stops later, at the 
	UK's newest station, and my word it was rewarding. The station building was beautiful, careening out over the platforms below. The stair/lift patterns were 
	admittedly confusing to Matthew, the CCTV cameras were very numerous (although the bin bags were satisfying), and the old station platforms were still very 
	obviously visible, only 50 yards down the track, but all of that was redeemed by the massive maps they had out the front - Neath was on there!!
	<br><br>
	We descended the long staircases to the pavement facing the road out of London, and decided that our best course of action was to simply leg it across the 
	dual carriageway. Health and Safety is very important to us at NT, so always wear a helmet when not looking for oncoming traffic when sprinting across a 
	dual carriageway. Leave the unhelmeted IPN activity to the professionals! Running across the road was definitely worth it though, as we were greeted by not 
	only our IKEA, but also a Premier Inn, <i>and</i> a Tesco Extra! Gordon Bennett, this was a true slice of God's Country outside of Kernow! We thereby 
	baptised this heavenly station 'Meridian Premier IKEA Extra station'. Amen.

	We made our way up the glorious escalator into Ikea, and began our Spinz i Ikeas! We wandered around all the showrooms, admiring the furniture as night fell 
	in. James took a photo of Matthew striking a Blofeld pose in an armchair, whilst Matthew snapped James looking insane, sitting at a desk! We looked at a 
	load of random crap on that floor, before having meatballs in the restaurant, a must-have on any self-respecting IKEA trip. Matthew was even persuaded to 
	have dessert!

	We then headed downstairs to the markethall, and bought a tinsel Christmas tree, a tealight holder, a tin can 
	and a light bulb, many of which came from Ikea's golden section: the bargain corner! Pleased with our magnificent haul of crap, and knowing that our fellow 
	Ikea challengers would be similarly impressed, we set off, back across the road, and then headed to the station... only to miss the train.
	<br><br>
	By a long way. The next train was in an hour. "You miserable excuse for a railway!" screamed Matthew. We did, however, take this photo. Admire the possibly 
	invisible IKEA in the background!

	This was a problem. Not only was James trapped with a very impatient Matthew, unused to waiting more than 5 minutes at this time of night for a tube, but 
	we had tweeted that we would arrive at the IKEA challenge rendevous in central London shortly... and would squeeze in a whole other Ikea. Also, it was 
	freezing cold. A nice touch. Thinking fast, we caught some random dodgy bus from outside Ikea towards the city, thinking that we'd quickly identify the 
	nearest station, and that we'd hardly lose any time at all. Oh, how wrong were we?
	<br><br>
	The bus wound its way through various streets in stabby city, taking more than its fair share of time to do so, and quickly eating into our alloted 
	amount of time to get to Ikea and back, whilst we earnestly consulted our telescreens as to where we were meant to alight the bus. 
	James claimed we should alight at stop n, whereas Matthew thought we should get off at stop n+1. The moment the bus passed stop n, we realised 
	that James had been right, and that we ought to have alighted there. The bus ground its way through the traffic to the next stop, at which point 
	we threw ourselves off the bus and sprinted down the street, in and out of numerous crowds who all gave us accusatory stares, laughing maniacally and 
	trying desperately not to get stabbed! This was pure, unadulterated madness! We had no idea where we were, only that this was the stabbing capital of

	We eventually reached the slowverground, ran up the stairs to the platform, clutching our selection of crap, only to find that we had completely 
	missed the platform gateline, had to run back down the stairs, tap in, run back up and catch the train. We took the Lea line one stop to Seven 
	Sisters on a small crappy train, before descending underground to the Victoria line. We took the line all the way to Stockwell, the penultimate 
	stop. The line was very pleasant until about King's Cross, when seemingly hundreds of people crammed themselves into the already claustrophobic 
	carriage. Squeezed in, pressed face-to-face, James got chocked. The congestion eventually eased at Green Park and Victoria, and by Stockwell, 
	it was almost pleasant again. 
	<br><br>
	We changed to the Northern line in our quest to reach Croydon and get back by half 7, when James dropped the bombshell that all the other teams 
	had been in Central London, in a bar, since half 5... when we'd set off. Whether James had previously withheld this information or whether Matthew 
	just failed to listen (more likely the latter), this immediately threw all our plans into the air. We were already on the rickety clattering train 
	heading south, so we went one stop south, alighted at Clapham North, in the strange station with a single island platform, and immediately saw a 
	conveniently placed Ikea advert! Seeing this as a suitable substitute for an Ikea visit, we ticked off our 4th Ikea of the day, rounded the total number 
	up to the full 5, and got on the Northbound train, waiting to share the fruits of our success with our fellow challengers. 
	<br><br>
	On the northbound northern line, we retreated back to Kennington, then up to Leicester Square. James got chocked again in Covent Garden on the Piccadilly, 
	which was another absolutely rammed train, then alighted at Holborn, before absolutely legging it down the street, searching left and right for the pub 
	they'd singled out on Twitter. We went in, despite Matthew's apprehensions, and found the rest of the participants in the Ikea challenge, all gathered round, 
	talking about their day's exploits. James decided to approach them:

	Hugo: Really? Have you been to all 5 Ikeas? <br>

	Hugo: Lakeside. <br>
	Matthew: Ah, we didn't do Lakeside because it isn't technically in Greater London. <br>
	Hugo:, True, but we went off Ikea's list, and they list it as a London Ikea, so we went with that. <br>

	Hugo: Did you follow the checklist? <br>
	James: Checklist? What checklist? <br>
	Hugo: The checklist of tasks you had to complete at each Ikea...
	<br><br>
	After a few of them read out the tasks and it became increasingly apparent that not only had we not followed the tasks, nor had any idea of the existence 
	of such a list, but that we had treated the entire thing as a joke and done our own thing, they quickly lost interest and ignored us, despite our  
	enviable selection of random crap from Meridian Premier Ikea Extra that we'd bought, merely because it wasn't on the prescribed list of crap to buy. 
	How would that be any fun if the crap wasn't sufficiently random? Also, we apparently hadn't been to all the Ikeas. Oops. Humilated, we left whilst no-one 
	was looking, thoroughly dejected. 
	<br><br>
	Taking a "short walk" to McDonalds, (crossing Holborn Bridge along the way, where James posed, stroking the ornamental dragons), we bitched for a bit about 
	how boring a pre-defined list of objectives was boring (as if we hadn't done the same), and how it wasn't nutty enough for us. In doing so, we came up with 
	our <i>own</i> Ikea challenge, visiting every Ikea in the UK! Ha! Beat that!

	<br><br>
	In McDonald's, we had food, sat and talked for a bit, then went to Bank, where we regained all of our nuttiness, at unheard of levels, running through 
	the entire labyrithine station, up and down and left and right, sprinting down escalators, trying to race one another (including Matthew pushing James 
	over in a desperate attempt to beat him), before waiting in Monument for an age. Finally, as it was very late and we'd been on the go for over 12 hours, 
	we took the District to Gloucester Road, the Circle to Notting Hill Gate, and the Central line home. Onto day 3!

	James arrived at Matthew's flat just before 11, and then after signing a contract for God only knows what (something chock-related, I believe), we headed 
	to Shepherd's Bush, changed to the Slowverground (which brought back memories of Koppa 1), southbound this time, to Clapham Junction (admiring the maps 
	whilst James made a little Chinese lady feel awfully guilty for existing), before reaching the Slowverground's mid-circle terminus. Against Matthew's tube 
	loyalty, we then switched to the NR platforms and took an SWR service to Richmond, because the District and Piccadilly lines were shut, and the Slowverground 
	to Richmond had carked it (the tube had really let us down that day, considering that we'd been to Richmond the day before). The NR train was a really 
	surreal experience for Matthew, despite having only been back in London for a month. The traditional carriage arrangement seemed weird, the announcers were 
	unfamiliar and just the entire setup seemed wrong to a tube addict like Matthew! The train was weird for James too, as it was missing stations, weird not 
	only from an NT point of view, but also from him being used to pacers in Kernow stopping at every miserable halt with 2 cows and a sheep to its name!

	Once at Richmond, the extent of the devastation on the tube network became apparent - literally nothing was operating. It seemed as if the buses refused to 
	operate either, as we ended up walking to Kew Gardens before a bus passed us to take us there, despite the journey of over a mile. James went into the 
	gardens, intending to visit the gift shop (but having to pay the entrance fee), and consequently took his time, having a good wander around, whilst Matthew  
	had re-entered full cheapskate mode, so despite wanting to visit the gardens, refused to pay the entrance fee, and instead left James to it. Matthew 
	wandered down into Kew, passing a Sunday trader's market (feeling thoroughly out of place amongst the artisan sellers), befored heading down to the Thames, 
	feeling very sorry for himself, having been divorced from his problem sheets for almost 48 hours. Safe to say, Matthew wasn't in a great mood that day. James 
	on the other hand, had a fantastic time in Kew (it probably reminded him very much of the Eden Project, albeit with a pagoda in the corner), so I shall leave 
	him write up about his time there in future:

	At quarter to 2, we met up outside the entrance, and took the bus towards Ealing, but it was so, so painfully slow that we decided to take matters into 
	our own hands as we crawled over the Thames in a massive queue (including numerous northbound busses, back-to-back), 
	and jumped off, walking over the bridge to Matthew's home turf, north of the river, before running down to Kew Bridge station to check for any phantom 
	trains. Disappointed (and with a rather agitated Matthew, worried sick that James would miss his train), we walked towards Chiswick Roundabout, and caught 
	a second bus took the bus to Gunnersbury, before then checking on the trains get again. This time, hallelujah, the slowverground was running, so we 
	slowvergrounded it to Acton Central, and finally bussed it to North Acton. 
	<br><br>
	We picked up all of James's stuff from Matthew's room, before we headed to Notting Hill Gate, eating crisps on the way, and James picked up his pre-ordered 
	Pizza Express (and Matthew sneaked a slice, after being too miserly to pay for his own). Needing to get his frustration out of his system, when carrying 
	James's bag down the stairs, Matthew thwacked some annoying kid in the head with the heavy bag, causing James to double up with laughter. Pleased with our 
	messed up and insane end to the day, we then headed to Paddington via Bayswater, ticking off one final station in our adventure. We walked over to collect 
	James's tickets from the exact spot in that station that the woman had been detained with suspected coronavirus, meaning that James got chocked as he boarded 
	his train back to Kernow, completing our longest ever adventure, and our last for 6 months!

	Tonight on Nutty Trains, James nearly gets shanked in Brixton, Matthew abandons James in Moorgate, and we both attempt the DLR Challenge... whilst still 
	jumping on and off at every station!
	<br><br>
	After R<sub>0</sub>=7, Matthew started packing to head to London, and a mere week after having a day out in Lydney, he was in the car and on his way to 
	London. Once there, he was able to see that London was far less chocked than James had anticipated, meaning that if he could make it, then we could not only 
	have a Nutty Trains adventure, but we could have a <i>proper</i> NT adventure! So therefore, just days before Drakey started imposing local lockdowns and 
	tightening some restrictions, James bought his tickets to "Lydney" for the "diesel special day" and was off to PAD!

	Koppa 3 was yet another adventure planned with almost zero notice. Whilst we had wanted another Koppa before the second wave struck in Autumn, Markey's late night 
	supermarket booze ban (and the threat of impending future restrictions) had caught us off-guard - we could see Wales hurtling towards higher restrictions any day 
	now, and Matthew advised James to evacuate back to Kernow as soon as possible. Therefore, just the day before, we called whilst Matthew was walking back from Ealing 
	to Acton and to organise any last details for the NT adventure on the very next day, before Markey unleashed the Welsh Language Society's paramilitary wing to 
	blockade the Second Severn Crossing.
	<br><br>
	After being fucked over by the buses yet again (this always happens in our Lydney adventures!), he made it to the train station eventually, got on his Class 800, 
	and was soon moving, on his way to PAD! He spent the journey down working on Chinese (he found that train is 'fire vehicle' (火车) in Chinese!) and coursework, 
	occasionally tweeting, laughing at David (the Cornish train manager), admiring the replacement pacers at CDF, the purps at Reading, and generally getting scared 
	by the chock and how much of a bad idea this had been! James's train was set to arrive at 12:12, so he had plenty of time to enjoy the journey down, especially 
	as unlike our previous NT adventure, the trains weren't also determined to fuck him over, which was good, as he only would have a couple of hours in London, and 
	Markey was making his life hard enough as it was.
	<br><br>
	After a great journey down, James arrived at PAD, was promptly fucked over by the circle line and had a terrible connection, allowing Matthew, who had been slightly 
	behind, some time to catch up. Matthew had been asleep when James has his bus catastrophe, but was then up all morning, yet still managed to leave North Acton 
	slightly late, and was just about at White City when James pulled into Paddington. The intention was probably to meet at Notting Hill Gate, one of our original 
	tube stations (and one of Matthew's usual haunts), but quite frankly, despite Matthew doing much brain-racking and investigating Twitter, Discord and text, he can't 
	work out what the fuck we were doing, as he is currently writing this about 6 months after the actual event. :)
	<br><br>
	So let's assume for the sake of simplicity that we went to Notting Hill Gate, and roll the tape from there. We'd have then taken the central line down to Bank, 
	ready to begin our DLR challenge at 13:05! On that journey, Matthew would have pulled his tattered OSTC paper from his pocket, with a full and comprehensive plan 
	for how we would get a leaderboard time for the DLR challenge! We would leave Bank at 13:05, head to Sandwell, double back to Tower Gateway to pick off both City 
	termini, and then would head all the way out to glorious Beckton! Once there, we'd double back, leap off at Canning Town, tap out, tap back in and sprint to the 
	train, all in 1 minute (one of Matthew's finer plans, he will admit). We'd head to Woolwich Arsenal, double back to Stratford Int'l, get fucked over by shit 
	connections (an ideal route, in all honesty, may start and end in Stratford, as all possible connections there fuck you over - illi vitae, we will overcome this 
	next time), make it back to Stratford, travel down to Canary Wharf, change trains, and end in Lewisham. This would give us a time of just over 2:20 - perfectly 
	respectible for first-timers during the pandemic!
	<br><br>
	At Bank, we leapt over the G A P, and journeyed through the warren of twisting, half-incomplete tunnels, right down the the under-construction DLR platforms at 
	the very bottom of the station, and awaited our alloted 13:05 train.
	<br><br>
	The train rocked up eventually, after we'd been suspiciously hanging around, missing the last 3 trains, and we boarded the front carriage, only to discover to 
	our absolute horror that the front seats were now taped off thanks to chock. Eheu! We'd miss the best bit of the journey! Never mind though, as we'd only get 1 
	section's worth at the front, thanks to our intention to resume jumping on and off dreckly. The doors closed, Matthew hit the stopwatch on his phone, and the 
	train eased out of the station - the NT DLR challenge had begun!
	<br><br>
	We climbed out of the long and steep tunnel, from underneath the bowels of the City, and onto the raised viaduct, giving us wide panoramas of the scenic East End. 
	Mmmmm. This was deeply reminiscent of Koppa 1, where we had tackled this same section (but on a Lewisham train and also at night), but more deeply of Aleph 9, where 
	Matthew had taken an extended trip on the DLR, actually in the day for once. Unfortunately, unlike that last trip, it was currently overcast and raining - not the 
	best weather in which to enjoy scenic East London. Before long, the first island station came into view - Sandwell. Again, being an exposed island station situated 
	directly in the middle of a wind- and rain-swept viaduct, this was also not the best weather in which to enjoy our surroundings. We hopped off, waved the train 
	goodbye, and immediately went to the other platform to start going in reverse - welcome to NT, where we do normal person things!
	<br><br>
	Fortunately for us, our time in the train was short-lived, as our reverse train soon rocked up. We boarded for our long 3 minute trek back into the city, pleased that 
	we would have shortly ticked off one fork of the DLR, despite this being a very slow section of the journey (and rather inefficient). The train pulled into Tower 
	Gateway, where we once again completely disembarked. To amuse ourselves during the turn-around time, we <s>walked</s> ran all the way around the front of the train 
	to the other platform (Tower Gateway has 2 platforms, which the train on the single track nestles snugly between), and promptly reboarded. Tower Gateway is a bit of 
	a strange station, having been built in the 80s as a temporary terminus, but now seemed almost redundant and hardly useful at all, thanks to its poor onward 
	connections. Nevertheless, the train was shortly ready to depart, and we headed back for Sandwell - take 2!
	<br><br>
	We passed through Sandwell, which in accordance with NT rules, we did not have to jump out at (we had visited here before), and similarly passed through Limehouse and 
	Westferry without alighting. After hardly any time at all (less than 10 minutes after leaving Tower Gateway on our eastward trek), we had reached the DLR's rollercoaster 
	section at the junction leading down to Canary Wharf. Instead of taking our usual overpass track, we this time dived underneath that track on the underpass, veered to 
	the right and descended into Poplar station, our first new eastward station on the DLR - ad Beckton!
	<br><br>
	We passed yet another junction after Poplar, leading up to Stratford, and then continued East, ticking off station after station. On this particular NT adventure though, 
	we decided not to merely take photos of the station signs as we alighted - this was 2020 after all! Instead, we decided to film short 2-3 second clips of us exiting 
	the train, and walking up to the sign. James would later string these into an NT video, the results of which can be seen at the bottom of this account.
	<br><br>
	We passed Blackwall and East India, both of which were situated in highly redeveloped areas of East London, filled with glass stations and clustered modern apartment 
	buildings. This became a trend for much of our journey close to the Thames, save for the extremities of the network. We also killed some time sitting at the back of 
	one of the train units, which looked out onto the front of the preceeding unit. Whilst this was no front seat, it was good enough! We also killed time by standing on 
	the rotating axle connecting the 2 carriages, which was very amusing to do as we attempted to keep our balance.
	<br><br>
	We reached Canning Town, and had a brief scout around at Matthew's request, as he wanted to build a mental map of the station before we attempted the absolutely bats 
	task of alighting, exiting, tapping out, tapping back in, running to the other (location unknown) platform, and embarking, all in 1 minute (fingers crossed there 
	would be no delays to make our lives even more miserable). We then got back on the train, passed Royal Victoria and then Custom House, where we spent all of our 
	time peering out of the window, admiring the new Crossrail station, and desperately trying to catch glimpses of the elusive purple roundels - coming to London, on 
	the 33rd of Neverember 2222!
	<br><br>
	We jumped off at Prince Regent, Royal Albert, Beckton Park and Cyprus, the latter 2 of which were strange stations, situated underneath and in the middle of 
	absolutely enormous roundabouts. Despite this, they were actually quite smart-looking and clean stations, despite the terrible noise of traffic and the onimous-looking 
	underpasses on either end of the station. We then passed Gallions Reach, and watched as the train started to double back on itself, allowing us to get a good view of the 
	completely undeveloped wasteground that lies at the edge of the docklands. It was a real phase change from the fancy apartment buildings that line most of the DLR's 
	route (mostly thanks to the DLR). It really looked like the old picture of London in the 60s, with patches of post-industrial wasteground, completely bombed out and 
	not rebuilt. Needless to say, Beckton itself was hardly better, situated at the arse-end of London, in a rundown area, on an overcast day. It kind of felt like the 
	valleys, to be perfectly honest. Ah, the valleys, the spiritual home of NT!
</p>
<center><img src="./resources/photos/Beckton.jpg" width="70%"></center><br>
<p>
	Before long, the train was ready to reverse up the line, so we reboarded and set off. This time, now that we were less preoccupied with spotting purple roundels, we 
	spent our time looking over at the Thames, which looked as grey and muddy as ever, and we also saw various Victorian industrial monoliths, slowly rotting and falling 
	apart. We also had a good look at London City Airport, which neither of us had ever seen before, and were very surprised by how strange it looks - it is very, very 
	obviously developed from an old dock, which we thought they'd have managed to cover up nicely during its polishing up as a premier business airport. It was especially 
	jarring to see it so close to the likes of Gallions Reach and Beckton. James found it very amusing, as it looked so odd, situated on a narrow strip in the Thames, with 
	wasteground all around it. It was also weird to see it so empty, thanks to chock. On the way back to Canning Town, we also saw the ExCel centre, now redeveloped into the 
	Nightingale hospital, which had barely been used during the first wave. It was quite astonishing actually that we'd managed to completely miss it on the way out, 
	because it was vast!
	<br><br>
	Finally, we reached the crux point of our entire challenge - Canning Town. The train pulled into the interchange station, and we immediately ran out of the doors, 
	and sprinted down the long platform, completely ignoring all covid regulations, and simply legging it - NT was back in style! We sprinted to the end of the platform, 
	threw ourselves down the long staircase to street level, and ran to the ticket barrier to tap out, an arcane NT rule introduced only to avaid maximum journey times 
	and the resulting fine. No sooner than we were out, we reversed, ran to the opposite end of the barrier, and tapped back in, as at the top of the other staircase, 
	we could see our train pulling into the station! We tapped in, ran even faster to the stairs and leapt up them 3 at a time in a desperate bid to reach the top. We 
	reached the platform and sprinted faster than ever before as the doors started to beep and flash at us. We leapt inside right before they closed and ruined our chances 
	of a leaderboard time. We'd made it!
	<br><br>
	The train negotiated yet another weird junction between the Beckton and Woolwich branches, with the Jubilee line disappearing under the Thames between the 2. We then 
	headed south, in the direction of the Millenium Dome, towards our second terminus branch. Matthew spent much of the journey refusing point-blank to look south out of 
	the window, as he could see the <i>Dangleway</i> and he could feel his skin burning by merely being so close to it.
	<br><br>
	Soon, however, it was out of sight, as we ticked off West Silvertown, 1 hour after leaving Bank, followed by Pontoon Dock and the very long and classy London City Airport 
	station. This was followed by the very strangely named King George V station, where James had a small moment, confusing left and right, before we headed underneath 
	the Thames to Woolwich Arsenal, which unlike Beckton was entirely underground. It had a very metro vibe to it, and both felt more similar and disimilar to the tube 
	at the same time. Either way, we'd arrived, and would have all of 90 seconds until the train reversed back under the Thames, and up towards Stratford:
</p>
<center><img src="./resources/photos/Woolwich Arsenal.jpg" width="70%"></center><br>
<p>
	The train made its way back under the river, back through the wasteground of the as-of-yet undeveloped docklands, past the Airport, which we had now seen from pretty 
	much every angle apart from above and below, and back towards Canning Town. Along the way, we'd catch glimpses of the ExCel centre from the front (the Beckton 
	branch mainly makes its way along the back end of the centre, so you can't see much), and also of the Tate and Lyle sugar factory, which was such a strange sight 
	to behold - we'd never seen anything like it!
	<br><br>
	We passed through Canning Town for the third and final time, then mirrored the Jubilee line on our next segment up to Stratford. Ooh, it felt good to hear the Jubilee 
	line trains hum into life as they left the stations - you really can't beat them. We even raced a Jubilee line train up to West Ham, after stopping at Star Lane, and 
	somehow managed to beat it into West Ham station - this was the pacer outpacing the sprinter all over again!
	<br><br>
	We jumped off at Abbey Road, which Matthew complained was one of the dumbest station names in all of London, as all the tourists are tricked into coming here, thinking 
	it is the location of the Beatles' Abbey Road studio (with the zebra crossing), only to find it is some dump in East London. We then went to Stratford High Street 
	(which had been Matthew's mystery ¬station, which James correctly guessed and won a very special, hyper-personalised congratulatory tweet as a result), then pulled 
	into Stratford, which, thanks to Freya, Matthew knew quite well... just not the DLR bit. We got a bit confused, wandered up and down for a bit along the platform 
	(the tube map representation for Stratford is rather misleading, similar to Paddington), then realised that we were on the correct train after all, and jumped back on. 
	<br><br>
	Finally, we headed up to Stratford International, which despite the small separation of the 2 stations, took a massively circuitous route to connect them (mainly due 
	to the vast station box for HS1). We pulled into the station on time, but thanks to the scheduling of trains in the Stratford area, were then fucked over by our 
	terrible connection time, the biggest single drain on our overall time across the entire DLR. Matthew offered to sprint from 1 station to the other, but even he 
	realised that the scheduling was so bad that running wasn't worth it. Instead, we waited in the white elephant station and got back on our train when it was time to 
	head back to Stratford. 
	<br><br>
	It was in Stratford that we approahced the record time for the DLR Challenge, held by Hugo, James's nemesis, and we realised that we'd really have to work on our time 
	in order to beat that. We arrived in Stratford, headed up the staircase and along the raised walkway, trying to figure out how the one-way system to the other DLR 
	line worked (well, Matthew tried to work it out, James merely ignored it), and then waited on the other DLR platform for our train down to Canary Wharf. The other 
	issue that we had is that thanks to this not being rush hour, there was no through train to Lewisham - we'd have to transfer at Canary Wharf, which TfL's journey 
	planner said was a 4 minute transfer. So this final Stratford Int'l - Lewisham section was causing us to simply haemorrhage time!
	<br><br>
	That said, we were starting to tear through these stations at a rate of knots. We passed Pudding Mill Lane, which had been shut during the 
	<a href="./aleph.html">Olympics</a>, as it was only a small station with little trains, yet was situated perfectly for the Olympics, so would have been completely and 
	utterly overwhelmed. After this, we hit stations basically every 60 seconds - Bow Church, Devons Road, Langdon Park, All Saints and Poplar. Devons Road caused 
	James to gag - we had reached the devil station! All these stations seemed very small, grimy and rundown, unlike the stations we had been to before. They were more 
	like glorified bus stations than proper train stations. We finally passed the record time at All Saints, so whilst we'd come nobly close (we were within sight of 
	Canary Wharf), the record time would be out of our grasp... for now!
	<br><br>
	We then crossed over the DLR's rollercoaster section, and pulled into West India Quay for the first time ever. It is a dinky little station, but neither of us 
	understood why it existed - it was honestly about 100 yards from the much bigger and better Canary Wharf station, and hardly had any trains visiting it anyway! 
	<br><br>
	We pulled into Canary Wharf, where James had formerly been fucked over by TfL's ticketing system (see Koppa 1), expecting to have to wait for ages for our connection. 
	But then fortune smiled upon us, and a train from Bank almost immediately followed us into the station, and onto the opposite side of the platform - we were saved! 
	By some miracle, we jumped aboard, having had a sub-30 second connection, and were hoping that this would shave at least 4 minutes off our time, and would boost us 
	up the eventual leaderboard. Ad Lewisham!
	<br><br>
	We pulled into the equally close Heron Quays, followed by South Quay, Crossharbour, the delightfully named Mudchute, and Island Gardens, all of which were around 
	90 seconds apart - we were so close to the end now! The skyline and cityscape around Canary Wharf has changed massively over the last 2-3 years, as a new 
	generation of glass-fronted skyscrapers and colourful apartment towers have sprung up, many of them almost eclipsing the height of the central tower in Canada 
	Square. The original 3 towers no longer stand out as they once did, and the area feels far more like Manhattan than it did before. James very much liked it though. 
	He could sense that the surrounding skyscrapers were definitely upper class, and he even went as far as saying that whilst we wasn't a City boy, he'd happily live 
	in this bit of London!
	<br><br>
	Most of the original DLR stations have been rebuilt to cope with extra demand, but nowhere was that more evident that at Island Gardens. The station is now 
	underground after the DLR was extended beyond its original terminus and onto Lewisham, <i>our</i> terminus. Island Gardens and Cutty Sark stations are both 
	within the tunnel under the Thames, and actually felt a lot more like tube stations than Woolwich Arsenal had done. They were quite nice actually - it was 
	nice to have a taste of the tube. We passed Greenwich, the oldest station in the world, Deptford Bridge and Elverson Road, and began the slow deceleration 
	into the final station. We were by this point watching the seconds tick down, watching our position slip down the leaderboard as we pulled into Lewisham. 
	We stood by the door, with James filming on his phone, and with Matthew having his finger poised above the stop button on his phone's stopwatch, waiting to 
	end the clock. The train pulled to a halt, the button on the door lit up, we pressed it, stepped out, and the moment Matthew's foot made contact with the 
	platform, he stopped the clock at 2:16:40 - a perfectly respectable time! At the time of the challenge, we were officially certified as the 
	<a href="http://www.explorerticket.co.uk/tubechallenge/dlrtop.htm">29<sup>th</sup> fastest team</a> to ever complete the DLR! Optime! We'll go back and beat 
	that soon, so watch this space!
</p>
<center><img src="./resources/photos/Lewisham.jpg" width="70%"></center><br>
<p>
	Exhausted from our challenge, we slowly made our way through Lewisham station, went down some corridors, and followed directions to the national rail station 
	- our quickest method of returning to the city. We boarded pretty much the first train that arrived (a Southeastern), heading to Cannon Street. We ticked 
	off a couple of stations on the way there, before crossing the river and pulling into the heart of the city. The train down was very nice, but also rather 
	jolting for Matthew, who had already managed to forget what National Rail felt like after 2 weeks on the tube!
	<br><br>
	Cannon Street was much smaller, quieter and darker than we had anticipated, and we were quickly outside of the station, washing our hands with the 
	compulsory hand sanitiser and standing in the city. Standing? Outside? Not on a train? Pah! This couldn't be allowed to happen! To the tube!
	<br><br>
	We descended into the adjoining Cannon Street tube station, and waited for a circle line train to take us around the Aldgate loop, to patch up a gaping hole on 
	our completed tube map. The journey went off without a hitch until Moorgate (apart from Matthew complaining about having to take a circle line train), when the 
	roundel we needed a photo of was right at the very end of the platform. We both disembarked from our circle line train, and jogged over to the impressive-looking 
	roundel right at the very end of the platform to snap a photo. But then, the doors started to beep and close! Miss a tube train? Not a chance! Matthew shot 
	off like a bullet to try and catch the train, as this instinct was drilled into him - there was no way he could miss it! James was slightly slower, and ran off 
	after Matthew to try and catch not only him, but the closing doors! Matthew flew towards the train, almost going head over heels, before leaping through the closing 
	doors sideways, just about making it on... without James! We stood, on opposite sides of the doors, waving at one another, as the train departed Moorgate, leaving 
	James abandoned on the platform. 
	<br><br>
	We'd joked about this happening at hundreds of earlier stations, but this was the first time that James had actually been left behind by a train. Therefore, at 
	Barbican, Matthew disembarked and waited for James, who had picked up a Met train. Meanwhile, Matthew stood in the cavity left by the railway/station, surrounded 
	by concrete monstrosities on all sides, trying to explain to a tourist that they were going in completely the wrong direction, before just handing her his tube 
	map, as James's train had pulled in, and he had seen James, having a laughing fit about what had just happened.
	<br><br>
	Now reunited, we passed through Farringdon, seeing the site of another Crossrail station, then disembarked at Kings Cross St Pancras, to pick up the misery line, 
	which we had not journeyed upon much (for good reason - it is shit). Matthew confidently strode through the mega-station, pretending that he knew exactly where 
	he was headed, and ended up at the misery line platforms. Just like always, he jumped upon the southbound train, confident that he was on the Charing Cross branch 
	(the intended line), and we watched as the train screamed into life and rumbled noisily down the tunnel. 
	<br><br>
	As ever, we jumped out at the next station, confident that this would be Euston... only to discover that it was in fact Angel. Fuck. Matthew had fucked up the 
	misery line. He had forgotten that the train that travels south to Euston is in fact the northbound train, not the southbound train, which was now taking us 
	back where we'd been, through Moorgate, Bank and London Bridge. Whilst this was fine (if not better) from a stations point of view, it was far worse from a time 
	and hunger point of view, the former of which James had little, and the latter plenty. Let me assure the reader that being trapped on a screaming, rumbling misery 
	line train with a tired, hungry and nervous James is no trivial ordeal.
	<br><br>
	Illi vitae! We headed south to Elephant and Castle, passed the new misery line branch at Kennington, and finally changed at Stockwell, onto the far more pleasant 
	Victoria line train to our, and its terminus in Brixton - the only Victoria line station we had yet to visit. The train pulled into Brixton after not much time at 
	all, and we had our traditional terminus photo:
</p>

<p>
	We then headed up the escalator, and out into the large station atrium with a massive glass frontage, walked up the staircase to street level, and stepped out into 
	Brixton. Brixton station is rather stupid, as the slowverground passes quite literally directly overhead the tube station, yet has no connection - it swerves out of 
	the way. And this, ladies and gentlemen, is why the slowverground is terrible - it has no connections anywhere, unlike the magnificent Victoria line! Matthew had 
	never been to Brixton, as his opinions of Brixton had been heavily influenced by his dad, who had known Brixton in the late 80s, and thanks to whom, Matthew had to 
	restrain himself from always pronouncing Brixton with a Jamaican accent. James however, didn't care how shit or dangerous it was - he just wanted lunch!
	<br><br>
	However, it turned out that Matthew's ill opinions of Brixton were perhaps not too far from the truth. Our first point of call had been the little Sainsbury's just 
	up the road from the station, for a sandwich. Yet right outside, we witnessed a security guard yelling at a customer and beating him up. What a wonderful welcome. 
	We were in danger :)
	<br><br>
	We decided to maybe <i>not</i> go to the Sainsbury's, and instead look elsewhere for lunch. We settled upon the Subway across the road, despite Matthew reminding 
	James about what had happened the last time he had one in Shrewsbury, but illi vitae, we headed in. In front of us, we watched the man at the counter have great 
	difficulty describing his order to the lady serving him, whose English was evidently not quite up to scratch, and each formulated different strategies for 
	circumventing this. It was James's turn first, and he decided to order one of the standard sandwiches (even though he didn't really want that anyway), in the hope 
	that it would simplify ordering.
	<br><br>
	James: Hello, I'd like a 6-inch chicken and bacon, toasted, please<br>
	Lady: <i>Looks quizzically at James</i><br>
	James: A 6-inch chicken and bacon, please<br>
	Lady: Ummm? <i>Looks confusedly at ingredients</i><br>
	James: Chicken and bacon! <i>Points at chicken and bacon display on wall</i><br>
	Lady: We no do that here<br>
	James: Yes you do, it is on the wall <i>Points harder at wall</i><br>
	Lady <i>Goes back to consult with manager, then returns</i><br>
	Lady: How I help?<br>
	James: Could I have a 6-inch chicken and bacon standard sub please? <i>Points again at board</i><br>
	Lady: Umm? <i>Looks quizzically at board</i><br>
	James: Me like chicken and bacon <i>Rubs stomach patronisingly</i><br>
	Lady: Umm? <i>Looks confusedly around</i><br>
	James: I WANT A CHICKEN. AND. BACON!
	<br><br>
	After this, James gave up, but was so committed to having a chicken and bacon sub that he painfully constructed it, ingredient by ingredient, step by step, just 
	about holding his temper in. Once he'd sat down with his sub, the salt was rubbed further into the wound by Matthew painlessly ordering a completely custom sub, 
	communicating solely through pointing, hand gestures, and shaking his head, without saying a word apart from "Hullo". James was not best pleased when Matthew sat 
	next to him, laughing at his ordeal.
	<br><br>
	<strong>"If they can't speak English, they shouldn't have a job!"</strong>
	<br><br>
	We admired the shittiness that was Brixton as we ate our subs, but decided that this was a more pointed type of shittiness than we were used to in the valleys, and 
	that we actually felt decidedly unsafe here. We finished up quickly and left Subway, immediately crossed the road to the station, and tapped in, retreating down to 
	the Victoria line, and away from Brixton.
	<br><br>
	It was now not long until James's train home from Lydney, so we took a direct route to PAD. We took the Victoria line to Oxford Circus and changed to the Bakerloo, 
	ticking off a couple of new stations along the way, before arriving at PAD (this section actually triggered a bit of a crisis that evening for Matthew, who did not 
	know how to meticulously classify the Edgware Roads and <a href="./us.html#PAD">Paddingtons</a>, and spent the evening breaking up the tube table).
	<br><br>
	We passed the location of the potential chock case that had scared us in early Feb, walked over to the train, and said goodbye, as James boarded his GWR Class 800 
	(which he threatened to hijack and take to Kernow). But Matthew needed to run an errand in Ealing, so instead of heading down into the tube station, he boarded the 
	purp train on the far platform, and walked about halfway up the train.
	<br><br>
	Then the trains threw our NT adventure one last parting gift - they departed simultaneously! Thanks to the long stretch of track leading to Acton Mainline, and the 
	generally low speed of trains out of Paddington anyway, our trains were keeping pace! In fact, Matthew's purp train started gaining on James's Class 800! Matthew 
	started trekking up the through the carriages, to increase his velocity, to try and become level with James, at the front of the Class 800. He drew level with the 
	middle of the Class 800, when the Class 800 started to accelerate and pull away, leaving Matthew level with its rear carriage. But then the purp started gaining again, 
	and Matthew kept walking all the way to the front, where he almost drew level with James... but then ran out of train! The Class 800 accelerated off to Swansea, leaving 
	Matthew behind and James greatly amused by this episode.
	<br><br>
	Matthew had a brief shopping trip in Ealing Broadway for the upcoming academic year, and then headed back home. James meanwhile was dealing with having broken eyes, 
	as he started to witness a reverse sunset, something that isn't possibly until Mach 1.05, which Matthew highly doubted the train was doing. Methinks James needed a lie 
	down after his long day in Lydney!
	<br><br>
	3 months later, we would finally be certified as the 29<sup>th</sup> fastest team around the DLR, and shortly after that, James released this fantastic summary video 
	of the DLR challenge segment of Koppa 3! Go and take a look - there will be more videos in the future!
