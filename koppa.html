<p>       Koppa Adventures: coming soon to a tube platform near you! As mentioned on <a href="./index.html"> our 
	  main page </a>, the Koppa (&#x3D9;) adventures on the tube/TfL network will follow different rules to usual. We have 
	  only recently started university, so we will be unable to undertake these frequently, but this has been planned for many 
	  months. London is uniquely suited to NT adventures due to the frequency of services and density of stations, so our 
	  adventures here should be optime!
	  <br><br>
	  So, James has gone to absolute pits and now is a big twitter enthusiast, he has created a twitter with associated twitter 
	  bot, this was what he was doing all the way up to London. Find it <a href="">here</a>...

<div class="content">
<p>     Having jumped off the screaming Northern train at Tottenham Court Road at 11pm, laughing insanely, Matthew decided to sprint 
	through a 1 foot wide gap at the edge of the platform, between a slow person and a not-so-slow moving train. This was going to 
	be a long night...
	<br><br>
	After months and months and 14 minutes of waiting, James finally rocked up in Paddington on a cool day in December. With only 
	so much as a "how are you" from Matthew, he started to run off to the other end of the station. Matthew's connection was in 2 
	minutes, and civilties were not going to delay NT! James straggled behind as Matthew <s>weaved</s> teleported through the crowds,     
	towards the <s>TfL Rail</s> Cross-Purp_Liz train. And so it began.
	<br><br>
	Heading towards the sweet spot, away from normal people, we sat down and were horrified by the new in-carriage signing, before 
	the train pulled out of the station, and we headed towards the hotel. Along the way, we ticked off the shithole that is Acton Main 
	Line (Which had appeared in a Geoff Marshall video only 3 days prior), before pulling into Ealing Broadway for our first picture 
	of the day:
	<br><br>
	<br><br>
	We then walked to James's hotel room, where he unloaded his stuff, and we headed back to the tube station, to take the Central 
	Line to North Acton. We headed to Matthew's flat, saw his kitchen, and sat in his room watching KBuzz and RTom lectures for an hour, 
	including a marvellous proof that all triangles are equilateral! Now we can prove Fermat's Last Theorem, and that 0=1!
	<br><br>
	Intending to head to Twinings, we then set off, even though it was already dark, and simulated Matthew's morning commute to Queensway. 
	We did not, however, run through Hyde Park (we did, however, get kicked out). We then walked down to Huxley, and saw Clore, the MLC 
	and the MCR, where we had a long conversation about the fake subjects in Imperial, like DesEng, Chemistry and Medicine. If you 
	can't prove it in L&#x2203;&#x2203;N, it isn't true! (Unless it obeys Adam's Lau: Trivial &#x21D2; True). At half 6, we left Huxley 
	to see the fake subjects in person, before exiting onto Exhibition Road and disappearing into the subway. It was time for trains!
	<br><br>
	At this point we noticed that it was half past 6. Our destination, Twinings, closed at 7. This was an issue. And as with any 
	temporal problem, Matthew had a solution...
	</p>
	<center><p>Fucking run!!!!</p></center>
	<p>
	So we accelerated all the way down the tunnel, cutting up the gormless tourists who were going to delay us <i>Matthew: They are 
	everywhere! Everywhere, I tell you! They wait for me to arrive so they had try and </strong>tap out<strong> with their paper 
	tickets! Aaaaaaaa!</i> However, we made it, and caught a District train eastwards to Temple, jumping on and off at every stop as 
	per usual. NT was now in motion!

<p>       This second adventure is very much work in progress, as we will have to see how NT &#x3D9;1 works first, but James will 
	  be returning to London after Christmas, on 11th and 12th Jan, so we intend to start 2020 off right, with some NT 
	  nuttiness. Cue more incoherent screaming from James about how busy amazing everything is, and more inaudible mutterings from 
	  Matthew about how the Circle line is delayed again. This may well be our biggest adventure yet, as it may last 2 whole days!
