    <p> Koppa Adventures: one foot each, coming soon to a tube platform near you! As mentioned on <a href="./index.html"> our 
	  main page </a>, the Koppa (&#x3D9;) adventures on the tube/TfL network will follow different rules to usual. We have 
	  only recently started university, so we have yet to undertake any adventures yet, but this has been planned for many 
	  months. London is uniquely suited to NT adventures due to the frequency of services and density of stations, so our 
	  first adventure here should be optime!</p>
	  <h1>&#x3D9;1: Actually Coming Soon</h1>
	  <p>We have actually yet to start the Koppa Adventures, because it turns out that maths degrees take a lot of time and 
	  effort! Fortunately, James is coming to London on 16th Nov, meaning that we will have a chance to undertake NT &#x3D9;I, 
	  and test out our new Tube Rules. I am not sure where his hackathon is, but it is likely we will start there, and mostly 
	  cover the Circle-District line from there towards Temple, for we have the Twinings shop to pay a visit to! Unfortunately, 
	  uni work will cut this first adventure reasonably short, but we will have enough time to navigate the our way around the 
	  Tube, try some nice tea, and have a jolly good laugh. Hopefully.</p>
