    <h1 class= "spacing"> Welcome to Nutty Trains! </h1>
    <p>Our Nutty Train adventures have taken us far and wide over the last few years. Our first adventures took place on school 
    trips, before we later decided to journey together to places by train. The real nutty trips only started in December 2018, 
    but have since become massive parts of our lives. Even though we now lead busy lives in university, we are busy planning 
    new adventures! Keep checking back for more nuttiness!</p>
    <p>This website began life as a side project on Luna's personal website, and originally consisted just of the stations we 
    visited. A few months later, she forked the page onto a new website, and nuttytrains.net was born (we purchased the domain 
    name back in ϡ6). Over Autumn 2019, we have assembled the website, and have immortalised our accounts of our NT adventures. 
    May there be many more!</p>

     <li> Eating a large bag of salt and vinegar crisps </li>

     <li> Taking a picture of ourselves in front of the terminus station signs (or other significant station signs)</li>
