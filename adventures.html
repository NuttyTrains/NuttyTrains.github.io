    <h1 class= "spacing"> Welcome to Nutty Trains! </h1>
    <p>Our Nutty Train adventures have taken us far and wide over the last few years. Our first adventures took place on school 
    trips, before we later decided to journey together to places by train. The real nutty trips only started in December 2018, 
    but have since become massive parts of our lives. Even though we now lead busy lives in university, we are busy planning 
    new adventures! Keep checking back for more nuttiness!</p>
    <p>This website began life as a side project on James's personal website, and originally consisted just of the stations we 
    visited. A few months later, he forked the page onto a new website, and nuttytrains.net was born (we purchased the domain 
    name back in ϡ6). Over Autumn 2019, we have assembled the website, and have immortalised our accounts of our NT adventures. 
    May there be many more!</p>

      <p> Who ever heard of dividing the country up neatly into adventure classes? Let's have a Xi adventure starting in London this time! Will James be hungover? Will 
        Matthew have a mental breakdown? Will Thameslink commit the not alive? Find out in Xi 3!

      <p> It was time for Matthew to face all his fears, because Cambridge hadn't been enough. We were going on an RRB *shudders*. We were going on a tram *fear*. We were 
        going to Croydon *faints*. NT was going saaaaaaf. #IKEAmeansIKEA

      <p> Oh no. It was time to throw ourselves straight into the jaws of danger and permanently damage our hearing: it was Brummy time! Along the way, we went on a 
        little tiny train and saw CAT. MAO!

      <p> Can Matthew and James pull multiple 12 hour+ tube challenge simulations in succession? Can Matthew find his way across London after being blindfolded and abandoned 
        in a field in Enfield with no phone or map? Can James finally get Matthew to order some cider? Yes. Yes we can.

      <p> It's back to the future: Uppa valleys yet again, to finish what we started 2 years ago, featuring a very special guest! We break into a sixth form college, 
        run down a river screaming, and get abandoned for 2 hours in the dark whilst drinking 100 coffees!

<!-- <h1>NT Traditions</h1>
<p>As you may have read in our accounts of our adventures, we have acquired numerous traditions over the course of our adventures. 
So just like the Victorian outcasts we are, we will now catalogue these traditions, to ensure they are preserved:</p>
<ol>
     <li> Eating a large bag of salt and vinegar crisps </li>
     <li> Eating a packet of coconut macaroons </li>
     <li> Taking a picture of ourselves in front of the terminus station signs (or other significant station signs)</li>
     <li> Trying to eat Pizza Express at the end of a long NT adventure</li>
     <li> And many others... </li>
    </ol> -->
