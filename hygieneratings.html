  Shortly after ϝ1, Matthew paid a visit to the holy grail of cuisine, the centre of the culinary universe and NT's all-time best-rated place: Dragon King Oriental Buffet!!
  <br><br>
  This is the story of ℶ1: Matthew went to NT's Best Rated Place, Dragon King Oriental Buffet, famed for its 0 hygiene rating in every category. Sadly, he is no longer with us, RIP.
  Matthew went and wandered around Dragon King and started to document the joys of this wonderful pilgramage, which was not far from Acton Main Line, too close to not be contaminated
  by the wonders of the bright purple fumes escaping from the Chimney. As Matthew encroached further towards the window and peered in he saw a figure. 小姐李 was standing there, the owner 
  of this fine establishment. She was glowing purple with a covering of furry black mould, yum. Although Matthew did not intend to eat as this buffet had been closed for a few years at this 
  point 小姐李 had put on a delectable spread of botulism, COVID-19 and a vintage SARS-1 virus from one of the first outbreaks. This was really a spread to behold. This was the last I hear 
  from Matthew and below were the pictures he sent before he came to his viral fate,

<p>James decided to celebrate his successful Chinese exam, to go to his local Chinese。 Owned by the very famous 小姐话. He ordered; Bang Bang Chicken, Chicken 
  Chow Mein and some rice. The place apparently had a five star review, but he could see the kitchens and they were full of hairs 
  and it was visibly dirty. Five stars, yummy... so he collected his food and decided he would give it at least a small chance. 
  When he got back though and opened the first container, he realised he had made a grave mistake. The bang bang chicken, wasn't a 
  glorious collection of stir-fried Chicken, sesame seeds, soy sauce and vegtables his tutor had lead him to believe, it was a collection
  of greesy chicken in some brown slop that could be diahorrea or just a year old gravy. Then the Chicken Chow Mein, wasn't however, stir-fried
  as the name so very clearly suggests, it was again fried, on oil and covered in the same brown diahorrea that was on the Bang Bang 
  Chicken just with Soy Sauce, lots of Soy Sauce. At least the rice can't be bad right? WRONG. It tasted of plastic. TL;DR Chinese takeaways
  are made by Satan to kick 毛 in the balls, those filthy capitalists. 我爱西！
