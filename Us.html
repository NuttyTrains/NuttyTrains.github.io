    <h1 class= "spacing"> Trains </h1>
    <p> We are self pronounced train addicts. James, after a trip to London on a HST and only having been on a train once 
	    before, was hooked. He was happy to see the introduction of the IET Class 800s and sad to see the end of the Pacers. 
	    Before he knew it he was mourning the loss of Arriva Trains Wales, Ave Arriva! Matthew, it was after his many 
	    adventures off on the trains and the call of the valleys, it was accentuated by seeing trains everyday going past 
	    at college, soon enough, he knew the patterns and told the time by what train went by and questioned descrepencies 
	    in the train timetable. Matthew is also incredibly lazy, and may or may not have copied and pasted this entire section 
	  from the main page. Fast forward a few months, and James is busy pottering about on his Cornish valley lines (it's a 
	    pity trains don't stop at his home station on a Wednesday), meanwhile Matthew is zipping about on the Tube every 
	    day, and actually lives next to the Central line. We both study maths degrees, in Exeter and Imperial respectively. 
	  The two of us met in Year 9 in secondary school, and bonded during ICT and Latin lessons there. Our precursors to NT 
	  began in Year 10, but it took until upper sixth form for the real adventures to start. We look forward to many adventures 
	  in future. Ave Arriva!</p>
	  <p> Also, for more nuttyness, James runs a blog of his nutty exploits, check it <a href="www.jsites.co.uk/SideProjects/Blog">out</a>! </p>
