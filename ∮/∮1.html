<p>
    This Christmas, join us as we finally head down South West to Exeter in NTCI 1: Bowis strikes back! <br><br>
    We join James, three days before NTCI 1 as they just about get their MathsBio and Number Theory coursework in. 
    Realsing that NTCI is only a few days away and they have little to no plan for Monday apart from, ok, we will 
    go to Exeter and try our best to tick off as many places as possible. Here are the ideas they had;</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Okehampton Take II</li>
        <li>Torquay and Paignton</li>
        <li>Go see James' ex-potential flat in Exmouth</li>
        <li>Go around Exeter and enjoy the xmas market</li>
        <li>Get burned by the shitstorm that is the Barnstable Line</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    Right, ok, let's take on of those ideas and break it down. Say the Exmouth Line, that would tick off a load of
    stations, keep Matthew happy and get one of the most unique stations in the UK; Lympstone Commando. It's a train 
    station on a military base. If there was one request stop, we could just request get off and walk to the next stop,
    but it's never that easy here on NT is it? Of course not. There was two. Two request stops. So James ran the simulations 
    in their head in order to try and work out what the best way to get both Lympstone Commando and Exton. James could see
    no 'nice' way to do this. We were both required to be on the same train and so we needed to both grt off and on at the 
    stations. James' plan of Matthew meeting them at Lympstone Commando or running between the two was very quickly scrapped.
    So it was decided very quickly that the best way to do this was the Sampi 6 method of pray to god somebody requests it 
    and see what happens *cough* Sampi 3 *cough* (On a sidenote, god, do you remember when big adventures were going up the 
    heart of wales line. Imagine what young James and Matthew would think of modern day Nutty Trains.). Anyways, the whole 
    plan was hope to bloody god something worked out, sound good? Yeah? amazing! <br><br>

    So right, the day comes, after very late last night frantically refunding all the epsilon tickets. RIP epsilon, too small for 
    your own good. James heads to the station in Camborne, early of course to try and sort out their tickets and the station 
    office is filled with old dears and codgers getting their train tickets to Plymouth and Truro for the day. The poor old station
    mananger was suprised to see James rock up with their massive line of requests and complicated borked tickets. <br>
    <strong>So, you bought all these and then you couldn't go <br> Yes <br> Boris is a bastard isn't he? <br> Yep :(</strong>
    and so then James waited for the 0934 to London Paddington and headed up to Exeter. Nothing eventful happened apart from 
    James was sat behind a family that made him see himself in the future,
    <strong>Mommy, can't daddy come into Hyde Park. <br> No, unfortunately Daddy has to deal with the payroll</strong>
    That poor man worked all the way to Exeter and I assume all the way to Paddington, however they were staying in a townhouse
    in Kensington (nice for some, eh?). <br><br>
    James got to Exeter and their plan started them off on good stead, they had a 2 minute connection. They jumped off of the
    very front of the train, well we can't be doing with going down into the second class can we? and ran past all the slow 
    buggers that were hobbling, heaving and dragging their sorry mortal bodies across the ground towards their next connection 
    or their impending doom on the tracks. Slow buggers. James zoomed past them, chucked a group of teenagers off the stairs and 
    ran with the now gather maraudering bunch of grannies heading for the Exmouth train, this was great! Just like the hash, but
    James was upsettingly sober. James and the gang ran like they had never ran before, after all it was only a minute before the 
    train left so they slid down the steps and chucked themselves towards the doors as they started to beep; the grannies all 
    chucked themselves through every open door or window on the train. The doors slammed shut and the last granny went splat onto 
    the door, poor old Doris was never the fastest runner, better get some alcohol in her next time. <br><br>
    As James released themselves from the ground, they greeted Matthew and finally NTCI was away! It had been a stupidly long time 
    in the making, but here we were, we were in the south west, with the whole of it on our fingertips and everything that could would
    go wrong. So cue the titles, that was just the bloody prologue, welcome to NTCI 1.
