    This Christmas, join us as we finally head down South West to Exeter in NTCI 1: Bowis strikes back! <br><br>
    We join James, three days before NTCI 1 as they just about get their MathsBio and Number Theory coursework in. 
    Realsing that NTCI is only a few days away and they have little to no plan for Monday apart from, ok, we will 
    go to Exeter and try our best to tick off as many places as possible. Here are the ideas they had;
    <ol>
        <li>Okehampton Take II</li>
        <li>Torquay and Paignton</li>
        <li>Go see James' ex-potential flat in Exmouth</li>
        <li>Go around Exeter and enjoy the xmas market</li>
        <li>Get burned by the shitstorm that is the Barnstable Line</li>
    </ol>
    Right, ok, let's take on of those ideas and break it down. Say the Exmouth Line, that would tick off a load of
    stations, keep Matthew happy and get one of the most unique stations in the UK; Lympstone Commando. It's a train 
    station on a military base. If there was one request stop, we could just request get off and walk to the next stop,
    but it's never that easy here on NT is it? Of course not. There was two. Two request stops. So James ran the simulations 
    in their head in order to try and work out what the best way to get both Lympstone Commando and Exton. James could see
    no 'nice' way to do this. We were both required to be on the same train and so we needed to both grt off and on at the 
    stations. James' plan of Matthew meeting them at Lympstone Commando or running between the two was very quickly scrapped.
    So it was decided very quickly that the best way to do this was the Sampi 6 method of pray to god somebody requests it 
    and see what happens *cough* Sampi 3 *cough* (On a sidenote, god, do you remember when big adventures were going up the 
    heart of wales line. Imagine what young James and Matthew would think of modern day Nutty Trains.). Anyways, the whole 
    plan was hope to bloody god something worked out, sound good? Yeah? amazing!
