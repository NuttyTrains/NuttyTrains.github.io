    Last time on Nutty Trains: CI, we had made it to devil country, but no further. However, finally, at long last, things were going to change. Matthew was finally 
    coming down Kernow. It was time for a 3-day NTCI extravaganza!
<br><br>
    Matthew managed to completely fuck up on the way down, misunderestimating the time it takes to travel all the way down south, and managed to book an impossible and 
    incorrect combination of trains. As he had advance tickets, he spent the entire journey down praying that no-one checked his (advance) tickets. The views on the 
    line were lovely though, especially around Bodmin. In that regard, Matthew was doing better than James - both of us were late, but at least Matthew could see. 
    James was blind drunk and aching after his hashing marathon. Yet, despite that, he looked less ridiculous than Matthew, who was accompanied on this train by 
    Llewellyn the wheel. And it is here, children, that we begin our story, with Matthew and Llewellyn pulling into Camborne station, stressed and numb inside after 
    a mental breakdown, greeted by James, swaying back and forth on the platform from the 10 litres of pure ethanol he had ingested. Welcome to Camborne. Welcome 
    to Kernow. Welcome to NT.
