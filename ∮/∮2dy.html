    Last time on Nutty Trains: CI, we had made it to devil country, but no further. However, finally, at long last, things were going to change. Matthew was finally 
    coming down Kernow. It was time for a 3-day NTCI extravaganza!
<br><br>
    Matthew managed to completely fuck up on the way down, misunderestimating the time it takes to travel all the way down south, and managed to book an impossible and 
    incorrect combination of trains. As he had advance tickets, he spent the entire journey down praying that no-one checked his (advance) tickets. The views on the 
    line were lovely though, especially around Bodmin. In that regard, Matthew was doing better than James - both of us were late, but at least Matthew could see. 
    James was blind drunk and aching after his hashing marathon. Yet, despite that, he looked less ridiculous than Matthew, who was accompanied on this train by 
    Llewellyn the wheel. And it is here, children, that we begin our story, with Matthew and Llewellyn pulling into Camborne station, stressed and numb inside after 
    a mental breakdown, greeted by James, swaying back and forth on the platform from the 10 litres of pure ethanol he had ingested. Welcome to Camborne. Welcome 
    to Kernow. Welcome to NT.
    <br><br>
    It was very, very odd being in Cornwall for the first time. We had made fun of Cornwall and Camborne so many times, and yet we had never been! Until now. NTCI was 
    go, and the first port of call was James' house. We put our stuff down, Matthew was given a house tour, we assembled a bed for Matthew in the living room, and then 
    headed out. True to form, some of the first things we passed on our way to Spoons was a smashed-up council house and a "no day drinking" sign. Lovely.
    <br><br>
    Spoons was basically empty, but was nice. James was astonished. James had even more to drink, but refused Matthew's request to frequent the even lowlier pubs in 
    Camborne. Not to be disheartened, we went on a fun magical mystery tour of Camborne! We walked up the main street, trespassed in the bus station (Matthew trespassed 
    on a building site too), went down Camborne Hill (the site of Trevithick's first locomotive journey), passed a load of chavs on the main street, and admired the 
    menu in the local Chinese - yummy yummy bang bang chicken! Unfortunately, James was unwilling to film an expose of this fine culinary establishment in his home town.
    <br><br>
    At the top of the street, we turned to explore the highlight of Camborne - Tesco. Along the way, we passed a gang of youths, busy setting the grassland on fire. 
    Fortunately, the dangerous vibes being given off by James and Matthew were more than enough to terrify them. Turns out walking backwards up the staircase, jumping 
    along the tops of the bike rack and teleporting across the street at unnatural speeds for Cornwall will terrify the local inhabitants. Who would have thought it?
    <br><br>
    After this, we went off into the heathland to explore the mine shafts. In the pitch black. This was clearly a good idea. James was unable to see anything, and 
    Matthew had no idea where the sinkholes were. Honestly, it is a wonder that neither of us fell into one of these abandoned mines, much as Matthew was hoping 
    for an escape from upcoming exams. We explored the old pump house and an abandoned industrial estate, and hoped that we wouldn't encounter any other nutcases in 
    the dark.
    <br><br>
    We headed back towards James' house, via the railway line. We stood on the railway bridge, waiting for the sleeper train to pass, and filmed some ultra-HD footage 
    for your viewing pleasure, including the only existing story of James' trip to Big Blue - exclusive content!. As for our viewing pleasure? Once back in James' 
    house, we watched a load of Nutty Trains clips, which we strongly recommend you do too.
    <br><br>
    Day 2 was meant to start with a bang. It fizzled and sputtered instead. We turned up to Camborne station, only to find that all the trains were dead. Welcome to 
    Cornwall. The ticket office had a queue out of the door, filled with old ladies trying to pay in farthings, and people hiding from the rain... apart from Matthew, 
    who stood outside in the pissing rain and garnered increasingly concerned and terrified looks from the growing crowd. Finally, the train showed its sorry face, and 
    we were off!
    <br><br>
    The train was already late, but James had planned to leave more than enough time for the connecting train at Par. None of Matthew's -1 minute connections today! We 
    met a Londoner on the train, who complained about Kernow public transport, and a local who complained it wasn't like that back in his day, and that London was awful. 
    The train slowly wound its way through Druth, Truro and St Auzzell... and then stopped. In the middle of the track. For about 15 minutes. A car had hit the railway 
    bridge. This adventure was already turning out great. We opened RealTimeTrains, and found that our connection was waiting! Could it be waiting for us?
    <br><br>
    As we approached the station, we could see it sitting there - Hallelujah! It was waiting! We jumped off the train, ran down the platform... and it pulled off. The 
    evil bastard had waited for us to show up, taunted us, and then pulled off. We were stuck in Par. This was going to be a fun 2 hours.
    <br><br>
    We had a nice (long) chat with our friend from the train, who continued to complain about the dire state of public transport in Kernow. We kept on running into him 
    for the entire duration of the day. We launched an expedition to the bustling city centre of Par, and found not only a Spar, but a Co-op! What a dynamic and busy 
    place. London had nothing on Par. We sampled the wares of Spar Par, bought some Cornish delicacies (some form of calories, sorry, cake), passed some kind of bakery 
    operating out of someone's living room (the car park was their drive), and found that this packed multicultural town had its own Chinese! Wonders will never cease. 
    You never run out of things to do in Par.
    <br><br>
    Then we ran out of things to do in Par. With about 90 minutes to go. Surprisingly, it was James tearing his hair out this time, perhaps because he was in the driving 
    seat for once, or perhaps because Matthew was post-double-nervous breakdown and his brain was in Safe Mode<sup>TM</sup>. Thus, we headed to the pub, met our friend 
    again, and started day drinking (tea - Matthew's alcoholic arc was still in its infancy here).
    <br><br>
    Finally, the train showed up again, and we left Par, and headed to the first destination of the day in the middle of the afternoon - Newquay. James recognised the 
    conductor as the grumpy bugger, and wasn't very optimistic about our chances of hitting all the request stops on the branch line. Still, we managed to hit 3/4 on 
    the way up, blowing past both our expectations. We passed all the china clay mines, and the rolling hills of the Cornish countryside, before crossing the magnificent 
    viaduct on the approach to the town. We pulled into Newquay station, having finally reached James' home town, 3.5 years after first hitting Matthew's. 
    W'lc'm t' N'wkee!
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Newquay.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
    We set off immediately towards the sea. Or rather, the cliffs overlooking the sea. The sea was filled with emmets. After Matthew started walking on the railings and 
    kicking an abandoned box of rice at a seagull, James removed him from the crime scene and showed him the wonders of Newquay high street (probably the best high street 
    we saw on the entire adventure, apart from Par. No multistorey car parks though). We both had a Cornish pasty (a medium steak), saw all the surf shops, and headed up 
    into the town to begin the magical mystery tour of James' childhood homes and his primary school. We passed the station again, and headed up past Newquay Zoo (Matthew 
    was astonished), and headed for Trerice Drive. After a small existential crisis and narrowly avoiding a mental breakdown, James then led Matthew to one of the 
    secondary schools in the town, right up at the top of the hill.
    <br><br>
    As a side note, this was a very weird Easter. Matthew had been home for 4 days, the first time he had visited Neath in months, and the place felt alien and distant 
    to him. James felt the same in Newquay - the town was frozen in aspic, like a static portrait, and was intimately familiar... yet it felt foreign to actually revisit 
    it, and retrace childhood steps. I dread to think how bad this feeling will get as we get even older.
    <br><br>
    The clock was beginning to tick down now, so once at the top of the hill, we made straight for the beach. James loved Newquay beach, and he spent many a summer there. 
    Turns out that there is an entombed wooden galley somewhere in the cove. Matthew was not keen on the beach, so occupied himself by watching the interesting fluid 
    dynamics of the sewage outlet pipe.
    <br><br>
    We climbed up to the headland, and made our way past Lusty Glaze, past yet more childhood memories, and back to the town centre. Time was now seriously running short, 
    so we ended up legging it back to the train through the mizzle, as Matthew, quote "didn't want to spend another 2 hours stuck here".
    <br><br>
    On the way back down the line, Matthew was yet again astonishingly cheeky and just asked the grumpy conductor if we could stop at the final missing request stop, if 
    there was time. To James' astonishment, this worked - Newquay branch line - tick!
    <br><br>
    For those readers with long memories, you may recall, about 3 lines ago, that Matthew "didn't want to spend another 2 hours stuck here", in Newquay. Hence, how 
    fortunate was he that we were instead going to be trapped in Par for yet another hour! Good thing we were stuck somewhere busy with plenty to do!
    <br><br>
    We spent a while trepassing in the skate park, which was essentially a MATLAB fever dream, paid another visit to Spar Par (never disappointing), attempted to film 
    the fire burning in the scrap yard opposite the station, but almost died of fright when we saw the scrap merchant sitting in his car outside the entrance, and 
    spent the rest of our time breathing in that beautiful smoke and avoiding the train nutter that was accosting us. Always nice to spend time kneeling in a soaking 
    car park, breathing in smoke and hiding in a bush to avoid conversation.
    <br><br>
    After half an eternity, the train finally showed up, and we boarded, in a foolish attempt to tick off a second branch line. We were moving forwards in time, from 
    James' childhood to James' university days (via a brief stop in Truro - James' sixth form). We changed trains at Truro, admiring the cathedral on the way into the 
    station (we need to go back), and went down the line towards Penryn and Falmouth.
    <br><br>
    We pulled into Penryn station (a borked station), and started to climb the hill towards campus. It was a very leafy campus, surrounded by green. Matthew hated it. 
    He really hated it actually. James was quite taken aback. Usually Matthew is jokingly ambivalent about this kind of thing, but this time he was caustic in his 
    criticism - "It is this kind of place that makes me not want to stay in academia". I don't even know why I was so upset by the place. Maybe it was my hatred of 
    modern academic architecture, maybe it was the laid-back attitude of the art students, maybe it was the feeling of desolation (all those oversized buildings, 
    completely under capacity), maybe it was the rural location, or maybe it was just the Stockholm Syndrome talking. Who knows. 
    <br><br>
    We headed for the Stannary (ie, the canteen), and Matthew got mugged, despite trying to exploit a loophole in the pricing system. Then we wandered around James' 
    'lecture theatres' - glorified classrooms, more like. We attempted to gain access to some of the other buildings, but failed (it was 6pm; the latest James had 
    ever been on campus, and apparently the doors lock at 6pm - cue Matthew's rant about his working hours at Imperial).
    <br><br>
    The train was not far away now, so Matthew attempted to whip James into running for it, all the way down the hill. James was adamant that it was impossible and 
    that his legs didn't work, but capitulated to a canter in Matthew's desperation to be away from Penryn. We made it almost all the way down the hill, and were just 
    passing under the viaduct, when the train passed overhead. We had missed it by about 1 minute. Fuck. What do now?
    <br><br>
    <strong>"Bus"</strong> - James whenever we miss a train<br>
    <strong>"What do I look like, a pleb?"</strong> - Matthew's inner Thatcherite whenever James suggests this
    <br><br>
    So it was settled - we would be <s>walking</s> <i><s>taking the bus</s> <u>racing</u></i> to Falmouth!
    <br><br>
    Like all good races, this was enormously weighted against Matthew. This was to be a 2.5 mile run along the direct path of the bus, with no clue where he was going, 
    having never seen this place ever before. He had a 10 minute head start over the bus, and that was it. Still, it should make a good video, despite the fact that 
    we both started in tempestuous moods. Matthew sprinted the entire way down the hill to the docks, walked towards the Old Hill, and foolishly attempted to run up 
    the steep hill. Gravity carried him all the way back down - he almost tumbled face first, got run over by a car, and careered wildly into some al fresco diners. 
    All in all, it wasn't a bad attempt - he arrived in Spoons only about 2 minutes after James on the bus!
    <br><br>
    We had drinks (Matthew was beginning his alcoholic arc), and then tried to make it to Falmouth Town station before the train arrived. RIP, that wasn't happening. 
    Once again, we arrived just after the train had departed. This really was not going well for James today. Instead, we walked along towards Falmouth Dock station, 
    advertised our upcoming Facebook Live stream (coming soon in 2024 - Old Codger jumps off cliff), and sat by the beach, in the darkness, for about an hour. It was 
    very weird to think that James was just weeks away from graduating. Had it really been 3 years? (Author's note - this is even weirder to think about, writing this 
    post-results and post-graduation. University is going to seem so distant so quickly).
    <br><br>
    At long last, we were successful. We returned to the station, actually caught the train this time, and returned to Truro, ticking off the Falmouth branch line (I 
    can't be bothered to find the real name). We then returned to Camborne. I remember nothing else of that night, apart from Matthew fixing some code, and eating an 
    entire packet of biscuits.

    Day 3!
    <br><br>
    We were dead after day 2, to say the least. Still, we got up fairly bright and early, and returned the living room to its original state (mostly). Then it was 
    off to the trains!
    <br><br>
    <strong>"Severe delays due to theft of Network Rail signalling equipment"</strong>
    <br><br>
    They'd only gone and done it. They had outdone Merthyr Tydfil for shittiness. Well done Kernow. You proved James right and made NT proud.
    <br><br>
    Proud, but not happy - how the fuck were we meant to do Penzance and St Ives now? The trains were all massively delayed! We decided to eventually just hop on 
    and see what happened. We passed through Hayle, and decided to abandon St Ives after seeing the hoards of emmets, and the impossibility of hitting all the stations. 
    Instead, we just pulled into Penzance - the terminus to end all termini. You don't get more "end of the line" than this! It was a nice station actually!
    <br><br>
    Pity the town was a bit shit though. True, they had a nice pasty shop, and a lovely statue of Humphrey Davy (always nice to see towns celebrate their scientists), but 
    that was about it - the rest of the town centre looked more like Neath, filled with shuttered and abandoned shops, with a few charity shops thrown in. We didn't 
    spend long here. This was a quick excursion to a fairly shitty place, just as NT likes it. We will give a more detailed review on ε', when we visit the Isles of Scilly.

<p>
    We dashed back to the train, only snapping this last-minute photo as the train pulled out of the station. We simply couldn't tick off this terminus without a photo, 
    especially as this was station 500!
    <br><br>
    We soon pulled into Camborne, returned to James' house, finished packing up Matthew's stuff, and waited for James to pack things for his conference later that day. 
    Unfortunately, James was dead. NT is not the most relaxing pasttime at the best of times, but it kills you after a 2 day half-marathon hash, and so many pints you 
    lost count on day 1. James was not ready to leave. He sent a snarky email to Hamid, walked Matthew and Llewellyn to the station, and waved Matthew off. North 
    Cornwall, Tiverton and an in-person conference could wait another day. It was bedtime for James.
    <br><br>
    It was fine time for Matthew. An older couple had sat by him on the train, emigrating to Australia, and we had a fantastic conversation about all sorts of things - 
    maths, physics, history, autism (they asked whether James was autistic, yet I flew under the radar), and emigrating, and they even fed Matthew. Matthew was so 
    content that he decided to stay on the train, and prayed that the conductor wouldn't check his tickets between Taunton and Reading, as he had tickets valid via 
    Bristol only. Unfortunately, the conductor only checked the moment we pulled out of Taunton, and Matthew had to pay £25 for a new ticket. RIP.
    <br><br>
    And thus ends ∮2dy, and began the intensive back-breaking revision period for 3rd year exams. See you in 2 months for ϙ12!
