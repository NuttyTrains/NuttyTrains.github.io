<p>
    This Christmas, join us as we finally head down South West to Exeter in NTCI 1: Bowis strikes back! <br><br>
    We join James, three days before NTCI 1 as they just about get their MathsBio and Number Theory coursework in. 
    Realsing that NTCI is only a few days away and they have little to no plan for Monday apart from, ok, we will 
    go to Exeter and try our best to tick off as many places as possible. Here are the ideas they had;</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Okehampton Take II</li>
        <li>Torquay and Paignton</li>
        <li>Go see James' ex-potential flat in Exmouth</li>
        <li>Go around Exeter and enjoy the xmas market</li>
        <li>Get burned by the shitstorm that is the Barnstable Line</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    Right, ok, let's take on of those ideas and break it down. Say the Exmouth Line, that would tick off a load of
    stations, keep Matthew happy and get one of the most unique stations in the UK; Lympstone Commando. It's a train 
    station on a military base. If there was one request stop, we could just request get off and walk to the next stop,
    but it's never that easy here on NT is it? Of course not. There was two. Two request stops. So James ran the simulations 
    in their head in order to try and work out what the best way to get both Lympstone Commando and Exton. James could see
    no 'nice' way to do this. We were both required to be on the same train and so we needed to both grt off and on at the 
    stations. James' plan of Matthew meeting them at Lympstone Commando or running between the two was very quickly scrapped.
    So it was decided very quickly that the best way to do this was the Sampi 6 method of pray to god somebody requests it 
    and see what happens *cough* Sampi 3 *cough* (On a sidenote, god, do you remember when big adventures were going up the 
    heart of wales line. Imagine what young James and Matthew would think of modern day Nutty Trains.). Anyways, the whole 
    plan was hope to bloody god something worked out, sound good? Yeah? amazing! <br><br>

    So right, the day comes, after very late last night frantically refunding all the epsilon tickets. RIP epsilon, too small for 
    your own good. James heads to the station in Camborne, early of course to try and sort out their tickets and the station 
    office is filled with old dears and codgers getting their train tickets to Plymouth and Truro for the day. The poor old station
    mananger was suprised to see James rock up with their massive line of requests and complicated borked tickets. <br>
    <strong>So, you bought all these and then you couldn't go <br> Yes <br> Boris is a bastard isn't he? <br> Yep :(</strong>
    and so then James waited for the 0934 to London Paddington and headed up to Exeter. Nothing eventful happened apart from 
    James was sat behind a family that made him see himself in the future,
    <strong>Mommy, can't daddy come into Hyde Park. <br> No, unfortunately Daddy has to deal with the payroll</strong>
    That poor man worked all the way to Exeter and I assume all the way to Paddington, however they were staying in a townhouse
    in Kensington (nice for some, eh?). <br><br>
    James got to Exeter and their plan started them off on good stead, they had a 2 minute connection. They jumped off of the
    very front of the train, well we can't be doing with going down into the second class can we? and ran past all the slow 
    buggers that were hobbling, heaving and dragging their sorry mortal bodies across the ground towards their next connection 
    or their impending doom on the tracks. Slow buggers. James zoomed past them, chucked a group of teenagers off the stairs and 
    ran with the now gather maraudering bunch of grannies heading for the Exmouth train, this was great! Just like the hash, but
    James was upsettingly sober. James and the gang ran like they had never ran before, after all it was only a minute before the 
    train left so they slid down the steps and chucked themselves towards the doors as they started to beep; the grannies all 
    chucked themselves through every open door or window on the train. The doors slammed shut and the last granny went splat onto 
    the door, poor old Doris was never the fastest runner, better get some alcohol in her next time. <br><br>
    As James released themselves from the ground, they greeted Matthew and finally NTCI was away! It had been a stupidly long time 
    in the making, but here we were, we were in the south west, with the whole of it on our fingertips and everything that could would
    go wrong. So cue the titles, that was just the bloody prologue, welcome to NTCI 1. <br><br>

    Here is the basic structure of what we did,
    <ol>
        <li>Exmouth Line</li>
        <li>Torquay</li>
        <li>James relives his childhood</li>
        <li>James gets very sad Living Coasts is ded</li>
        <li>Living Coasts is ded :(</li>
        <li>Depression. Living Coasts is ded.</li>
        <li>MOAARR Torquay</li>
        <li>NT AC Day 25 clip</li>
        <li>Paignton</li>
        <li>Steam Train RIP :(</li>
        <li>Food</li>
        <li>Crack Pie</li>
        <li>Uni</li>
        <li>Running to Station</li>
    </ol>
    <p>That shit'll be written later. James is currently on the last train of the night with homeless people just sleeping on the train and 
    drunkards that are just falling over the homeless people. This was an amazing idea, if I die, you know why.</p>

<p>
    I am not going to step on James' toes here, given that this is the largest chunk of text James has ever written, or will ever write on this website. So I am briefly 
    going to expand upon my (now-limited) memories of this adventure, 6 months after it happened.
    <br><br>
    This adventure was born from the ashes of NT Epsilon, which was cancelled thanks to Boris. This adventure would have involved Matthew catching a dirt-cheap early 
    morning train to Exeter (SWR *vomits*), before we slowly headed east to the Isle of Wight. We cancelled all our tickets, afraid of chockdown 3, but with only days 
    to go, with chockdown 3 not happening (yet), Matthew still had his dirt-cheap ticket to Exeter. Hmmm.... it was time for a plan. Thus, âˆ®1dx was born!
    <br><br>
    Matthew got what he paid for. The train was miserable, slow and had no sockets. It was dire. He was extremely glad when he arrived in Exeter St Davids, went to 
    Starbucks, and sat there charging his laptop, waiting for James to turn up.
    <br><br>
    And he waited<br>
    And waited<br>
    And went to the shop<br>
    Then waited<br>
    Then went to the platform, got on the train, and waited.<br>
    Where the fuck was James?
    <br><br>
    Out of nowhere, an "upsettingly sober" floppy-haired James came barrelling down the stairs, pushing over teenagers and grannies alike, and threw himself between 
    the closing, beeping doors. Matthew is always late. It simply wouldn't have done to be arriving on time. After all, James was in the driving seat this time, and 
    when in Rome...
</p>
<h2>Exmouth Line</h2>
<p>
    The first port of call was the Exmouth line. We reversed back up the line towards Salisbury, before turning towards the coast. We passed through a number of quiet 
    stations, and the line ran alongside the muddy flats of the Exe floodplain. James gave Matthew an ornithology lesson, by teaching him the names of all the lines 
    in the South West, all named after birds that Matthew had never heard of or seen before. Nor can he remember them, because this was 6 months ago. All he can 
    remember is that we spotted some bird-like things by the river. It was a yummy grey December day, so the river and the sky looked beautiful.
    <br><br>
    As far as South West branch lines go, this was the easiest of the bunch, despite Matthew thinking it was extremely complicated. Once per hour, a train would stop 
    at every station on the line, with only 2 request stops. Unfortunately, the latter of these, Lympstone Commando, was completely dead, with almost 0 passengers. 
    James assumed this would be the main difficulty.
    <br><br>
    Fortunately, someone wanted to stop at Exton, the other request stop, so that left only Lympstone Commando. We asked the conductor if he could stop the train. 
    As we pulled into the station, we were greeted by a horrible concrete and barbed wire monstrosity of an army base. It looked like Colditz in the grey mizzle. We 
    both hopped off, and James started to walk towards the exit, fully intending to walk to Lympstone Village. Matthew took another look at Colditz, looked back at 
    the train, jumped back on, and said "thank you" to the conductor, before sitting down, to James' horror. The audacity of that boy! The cheek! The nerve! Down Kernow, 
    you'd never do that! That damn city boy!
    <br><br>
    We rocked up into "sunny", "pleasant" Exmouth - a vile port town surrounded by a grey pallid sea and beige mudflats. We fucked around for a little, Matthew walked 
    backwards through a tunnel, we jumped over a fence, got bored, had our station photo, and returned to the train, this time heading to Torquay.

<h2>Torquay</h2>
<p>
    We headed back up to Exeter, and then passed straight through, heading down the Devon mainline towards Kernow. As tempted as James was to make the trip to 
    Kernow itself, he decided that today would be focussed on Torquay and Paignton. We'd both recently watched Fawlty Towers - maybe that clouded our judgement.
    <br><br>
    We travelled down the mainline, this time not running alongside the river, but alongside the sea; the freezing, pallid, grey waves crashing against the 
    railway embankment. Apart from the imminent premonitions of death as we passed through Dawlish, this was actually a nice section of line. Lots of pretty 
    seaside villages. Having the line so close to the sea would have been beautiful in summer... why did we choose to do this in December?
    <br><br>
    <i>Editor's Note: James is never in Kernow in the summer anymore. That is why</i>
    <br><br>
    Before long, we were in Newton Abbott, and turned off the mainline to head to Torquay and Paignton. It was Basil Fawlty time.
</p>
<h2>James relives his childhood</h2>
<p>
    Torquay station was actually very nice. A nice old building. That is probably what enticed us off the train in the first place, instead of continuing on to Paignton. 
    When we realised we were now stuck here for almost an hour, we decided to do some exploring. We headed down to the promenade, and walked alongside the beach, the 
    turgid, bleached sand, the turbulent, foaming sea, and the grey, mizzling sky. Beautiful scenes from NT. It was postcard-perfect.
    <br><br>
    Along we went, passing the handful of tourists questioning why they were there in December, and walked towards the town. Christ, it was some distance. Clearly 
    somebody wanted to save money (*cough*, GWR, *cough*). We arrived in the town's marina, and found literally everything to be closed. The cafe was basically closed, 
    the shops were closed, but worst of all...
</p>
<h2>James gets very sad Living Coasts is ded</h2>
<h2>Living Coasts is ded :(</h2>
<h2>Depression. Living Coasts is ded.</h2>
<p>
    Living Coasts was ded. That central feature of James' childhood had been chocked out of existence. RIP. James regaled Matthew with many fun stories about birds 
    becoming stuck in the netting above the zoo and dying/being eaten by seagulls.
    <br><br>
    Matthew amused himself by wandering around the multi-storey car park. It wasn't huge, but it scored highly for dinginess, dripping pipes, sodium lighting, and being 
    attached to an abandoned, decaying aquarium. After we both managed to get a bit lost, we decided that the best method of suicide prevention for James (Living Coasts 
    was ded) would be to return to the town. So that's what we did.
</p>
<h2>MOAARR Torquay</h2>
<p>
    We made our way through the ocean of boarded-up stores, tacky gift shops, and high street chains that are allegedly the envy of the South West (or so said James' mum 
    when she discovered that Torquay was the location of that rarest of sights - a Primark). We walked through the marina and up the high street. It had been more than 10 
    minutes since Matthew's last coffee, so he was on the verge of complete bodily shutdown. After passing such luxury retail offerings as Poundland, Shoe Zone and Greggs 
    (side note - I just went on Google Maps to check this - I had completely forgotten about "License to Fill", the sandwich shop. How could I forget that?), we went into 
    Caffe Nero to re-caffinate Matthew.
    <br><br>
    We were pretty much done with Torquay by this point, so decided to head slowly back to the station. Matthew, for some unknown reason, was in charge of navigating, and 
    he decided that the best way of doing this was to head straight up a cliff, over a headland, and straight down the cliff on the other end. Up and up we walked, winding 
    our way up the cliff-face, with neither of us knowing where we were going. At some point, Matthew must have realised his mistake, because we descended into yet 
    another multi-storey car park, and raced each other to the ground. Unfortunately, once again, we didn't bother to set an end point, and so managed to completely miss 
    each other on the way down. Great success!
    <br><br>
    As we made our way around the bay, back to the station, we soon realised that we were simply not going to make this train. In true Matthew fashion, he suggested we 
    walk to Paignton. However, as this was James' adventure, he decided that we should instead head to the beach to kill an hour. The beach. Matthew's favourite place. 
    <br><br>
    James and Matthew were attacked by some angry swans as we walked over to the edge of the beach, to a large sign emblazoned "THESE ROCKS ARE CUT OFF BY INCOMING TIDE". 
    Perfect. Exactly what we wanted. Matthew was also attacked by this strange turbulent fluid that continued to oscilate its way towards him, menacingly. James called it 
    "the sea".
</p>
<h2>NT AC Day 25 clip</h2>
<p>
    Christ, this seems like a long time ago.
    <br><br>
    We had spent the last month working on various Christmas projects - Matthew on his Santa Tracker (which worked perfectly until the 1st of January, at which point 
    it completely shat itself), and James on his advent calendar (possibly the worst decision ever taken on NT). It was taking up so much time and effort, and yet we 
    had nothing to end it with! No Christmas extravaganza! No grand finale! This had to change. We were going to film one today.
    <br><br>
    Oh my God was this sad. I don't even want to talk about it. Just watch. Watch it, suffer, and die inside so that I don't have to recall it.
</p>
<center><iframe id="largevid" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hOLmuEDJSDc" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>
<p>
    That's it. Done. Finito. God, I am never doing this again.
    <br><br>
    And who let Geraint, James and Jethro on vocals?
    <br><br>
    The video didn't even come out in time for Christmas - it was released on January 1st. All that depression, for more depression.
    <br><br>
    After that horrific ordeal was over, we tried to drown ourselves by walking onto the rocks that were imminently about to be cut off by the tide, all whilst singing 
    NHSMas (coming soon to the NT Music label, hopefully never). Nevertheless, armed with ideas for terrible Christmas videos, we returned to the station, had our photo, 
    and went to Paignton.
