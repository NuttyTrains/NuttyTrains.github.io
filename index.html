    <p> Welcome to Nutty Trains! <br>
      We are James and Matthew, but seeing as you are here, you probably already knew that. We have been going on nutty adventures for a 
      number of years now, and this website is here to serve as a digital record of them, so that we don't forget what we managed to get 
      up to, and have something to look forward to when we become too fed up of constant work and lockdown restrictions.
      <br><br>
      Our initial adventures happened partially by mistake, either as school trips, or just as trips that we did in summer 2018, and 
      happened to involve a few trains and were a bit nuts. But soon after, having been inspired by All the Stations, and also being 
      in need of some grand nutty project, that would involve visiting many shitty places along the way, we set off on our first 
      proper nutty train adventure in December 2018, and haven't looked back since!
      <br><br>
      This is <strong>NOT</strong> a trainspotter website. We both like trains (especially HSTs and Pacers), but this website is here to 
      record all of our nutty adventures that we get up to, the various places we visit, and increasingly, the twitter bots that have grown 
      up alongside this account, and create havoc in our name. It is much more enjoyable and nutty that way. Ave Arriva!
      <br><br>
	    Nevertheless, our intention remains to eventually visit every station in the UK, (at some point in the distant future), according to 
      the following hallowed Nutty Trains rules, which we adhere to, even to this day:
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="box80">
    <ol>
      <li> To say we visited a station we must:
	<ul> 
	  <li> Be on a train that stops at the station </li>
	  <li> Touch the platform </li>
          <li> Take a photograph of the station sign </li>
	  <li> (Optional due to short platforms) Run between the carriage doors (James' Job) </li>
	</ul>
     </li>
     <li> We are allowed to use public transport (other than trains), to arrive or leave a station, but not both. We must arrive or leave on a train. </li>
     <li> We are allowed to use parlimentary trains and heritage railways, as long as we validly tick off the station. </li>
     <li> We must take photos of ourselves in front of the station sign, when we arrive at notable stations (eg. termini) </li>
    </ol> 
  </div>

	<div id="box100">  
    <p id="StationNo" class="LatestNR">We have visited 202 Stations</p>
  </div>

    <span id="dots"></span>
 
    <button onclick="More()" id="MoreBtn">Show Station List</button>
    <span id="more">
    </span>


<br><br>
<div id="box100">
<p> By late 2019, we had both moved out of Wales. James was busy tearing his hair out due to the terrible service on the Cornish railways 
    (trains don't stop Camborne Wednesdays), meanwhile Matthew was enjoying using the Tube every day, and actually lives next to the 
    Central line. As a result, we realised that the Tube and other TfL services function very differently from 
    National Rail elsewhere, meaning a different set of rules is required:</p>
</div>

<div id="box20">
  <img width="100%" src="./resources/photos/Baker Street.jpg"><br>
  <img width="100%" src="./resources/photos/Olympia.jpg">
</div>

<div id="box80">
    <ol>
      <li> To say we visited a station we must:
	<ul> 
	  <li> Be on a train that stops at the station </li>
	  <li> Step on the platform as a minimum (although alighting is encouraged) </li>
	  <li> Take a picture of the station sign at any station where we alight </li>
	  <li> Tap out roughly once an hour, to avoid maximum journey times </li>
	</ul>
     </li>
     <li> During peak hours, we ought to alight, switch carriages, and catch the next train </li>
     <li> We are allowed to use public transport (other than trains), to arrive or leave a station, but not both. We must arrive or leave on a train. </li>
     <li> We are allowed to use any TfL heavy/light rail service (excluding Tramlink), provided we validly tick off the station. </li>
     <li> These rules apply to: 
	<ul> 
	  <li> London Underground </li>
	  <li> DLR </li>
	  <li> London Overground </li>
	  <li> TfL Rail/Elizabeth Line </li>
	</ul>
     </li>
     <li> Our station table will be organised alphabetically, as opposed to numerically, to allow for the provision of multiple lines at each station </li>
     <li> These rules do not apply to National Rail services in the Oyster PAYG zone. These rules apply only to TfL services. </li>
     <li> Further explanation of the rules can be found deep in the back-end of the website </li>
    </ol>

<p>By the end of our second summer of NT, in the midst of the covid pandemic, we made our first visit to a heritage railway - the Dean Forest Railway in Lydney, 
and decided that heritage railways deserved their own list of stations too - after all, no-one has ever documented visiting all the heritage railways 
before! But realistically, this is just an excuse to ride more steam trains.</p>
    <ol>
      <li> To visit a heritage railway station we must:
	<ul> 
          <li> Be on a heritage train which stops at the station </li>
	  <li> Alight from the train </li>
	  <li> Take a photo of the station sign </li>
	</ul>
     </li>
	    <li> We must also take a photo of our locomotive </li>
    </ol>

<p> During Koppa 2, James found out that his new Twitter friends were planning an #IKEAmeansIKEA escapade all around London the day 
  after the UK left the EU. So we valiantly decided to participate in this challenge, only to find our good-faith attempt to gatecrash 
  their challenge and take the piss was rejected. As revenge, we decided to visit all the IKEAs in the UK. We'll show you yet, Hugo! 
  There are only 18 of them! How hard can it be?</p>
    <ol>
      <li> To get to an IKEA we must:
	<ul> 
	  <li> Use a train to arrive at the closest station to an IKEA </li>
	  <li> Follow all above NT rules at the station </li>
	  <li> Walk to the IKEA, no matter how impossible that may be </li>
	</ul>
     </li>
      <li> To say we visited an IKEA we must:
	<ul> 
	  <li> Walk through all the showrooms - no shortcuts! </li>
	  <li> Visit the restaurant </li>
	  <li> Steal >1 pencil </li>
	  <li> Most importantly, we must purchase at least 1 item of random crap!</li>
	</ul>
     </li>
     <li> We are allowed to leave in the manner in which we arrived, or take the bus. That doesn't matter </li>
    </ol>

<p>Sometimes, we go on adventures that are so shit, they don't even deserve a proper write-up: they aren't even worthy of the title <a href="./aleph.html">aleph</a>. 
But they are kind of funny, and we'd like to document these too. So, we introduce the <a href="./beth.html">Beth (ℶ) Adventures</a>: Shitty little ramblings that we 
dump in a CSV (coming soon) because we can't be bothered to write them up properly. Coming soon to a pub/tube train/pub/dodgy street corner/pub near you!</p>
    <ol>
      <li> To qualify as a Beth (ℶ) adventure, it must:
  <ul> 
    <li> Be nutty </li>
    <li> Be slightly shit </li>
    <li> Involve a train? (Optional) </li>
  </ul>
    </ol>
