# NuttyTrains.github.io
Hello, we are James and Matthew. We are fascinated by railways and enjoy going on random, ill-planned, reckless railway adventures. Welcome to NT!  

This is our website, where we co-ordinate all our nuttiness! This website represents over 2 years of hard work, and 1200 commits and counting of 
top-notch NT-quality code! Much of our attention has shifted towards our twitter and Youtube accounts as of late, but if you have come 
looking for our central repository, you have come to the right place. Our best tweets, most of our videos, and all of our in-depth write-ups can be found here, as well 
as much much more in the back-end (if you know where to look). [Please don't look].

Trains: Probably uppa valleys  
and literally nowhere else

## Release Notes
### v.1216: 'Finally, we meet again, Dr.README'
The NT advent calendar countdown is now live! The CSVs have been tidied up and some videos added. All write-ups pre-Xi 4 are now complete, with Xi 4 and Koppa 8 on the 
horizon. Sampi 7, Digamma 2 and Koppa 9 are still WIP. Various Aleph write-ups also may be coming. Quite frankly, we are both dying at the moment, so serious progress 
probably will not be made until Christmas.
### v.1305: 'NT Santa Tracker 2.0'
Phase 2 of the NT Santa Tracker is now live! More stops will come later, along with Santa (hopefully). The Advent Calendar is on its way, Koppa 8 is almost complete, and 
some Alephs have been completed too. Numerous adventures are about to imminently be ticked off when the Advent Calendar videos go live next week:
