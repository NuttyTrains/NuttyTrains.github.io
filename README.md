# NuttyTrains.github.io
Hello, we are James and Matthew. We are fascinated by railways and enjoy going on random, ill-planned, reckless railway adventures. Welcome to NT!  

This is our website, where we co-ordinate all our nuttiness! This website represents over 2 years of hard work, and 1400 commits and counting of 
top-notch NT-quality code! Much of our attention has shifted towards our twitter and Youtube accounts as of late, but if you have come 
looking for our central repository, you have come to the right place. Our best tweets, most of our videos, and all of our in-depth write-ups can be found here, as well 
as much much more in the back-end (if you know where to look). [Please don't look].

and literally nowhere else

## Release Notes
### v.1216: 'Finally, we meet again, Dr.README'
The NT advent calendar countdown is now live! The CSVs have been tidied up and some videos added. All write-ups pre-Xi 4 are now complete, with Xi 4 and Koppa 8 on the 
horizon. Sampi 7, Digamma 2 and Koppa 9 are still WIP. Various Aleph write-ups also may be coming. Quite frankly, we are both dying at the moment, so serious progress 
probably will not be made until Christmas.

### v.1305: 'NT Santa Tracker 2.0'
Phase 2 of the NT Santa Tracker is now live! More stops will come later, along with Santa (hopefully). The Advent Calendar is on its way, Koppa 8 is almost complete, and 
some Alephs have been completed too. Numerous adventures are about to imminently be ticked off when the Advent Calendar videos go live next week:

### v.1462: 'Perry the Platypus, how unexpected!'
I genuinely did not expect this - we have shot up by over 200 commits in a matter of days! What the fuck has happened here? Well, I can exclusively reveal that both the 
NT Advent Calendar and the NT Santa Tracker are now live, with only minor polishings needed. Merry Christmas!

### v.1541: 'NT Santa Tracker'
It is live! The NT Santa Tracker is now finally complete! Xi 4 is now also complete, along with most of Sampi 7 and some of âˆ®1dx. The NT Advent Calendar is almost finished 
as we count down to Christmas. Merry Christmas from all of us at Nutty Trains, and a Happy 2022! Let the nuttiness continue!
