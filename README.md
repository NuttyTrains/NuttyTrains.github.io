# NuttyTrains.github.io
Hello, we are James and Matthew. We are fascinated by railways and enjoy going on random, ill-planned, reckless railway adventures. Welcome to NT!  

This is our website, where we co-ordinate all our nuttiness! This website represents over 2 years of hard work, and 1600 commits and counting of 
top-notch NT-quality code! Much of our attention has shifted towards our twitter and Youtube accounts as of late, but if you have come 
looking for our central repository, you have come to the right place. Our best tweets, most of our videos, and all of our in-depth write-ups can be found here, as well 
as much much more in the back-end (if you know where to look). [Please don't look].

Trains: Probably uppa valleys  
and literally nowhere else

## Release Notes
### v.1216: 'Finally, we meet again, Dr.README'
The NT advent calendar countdown is now live! The CSVs have been tidied up and some videos added. All write-ups pre-Xi 4 are now complete, with Xi 4 and Koppa 8 on the 
horizon. Sampi 7, Digamma 2 and Koppa 9 are still WIP. Various Aleph write-ups also may be coming. Quite frankly, we are both dying at the moment, so serious progress 
probably will not be made until Christmas.

### v.1305: 'NT Santa Tracker 2.0'
Phase 2 of the NT Santa Tracker is now live! More stops will come later, along with Santa (hopefully). The Advent Calendar is on its way, Koppa 8 is almost complete, and 
some Alephs have been completed too. Numerous adventures are about to imminently be ticked off when the Advent Calendar videos go live next week:

### v.1462: 'Perry the Platypus, how unexpected!'
I genuinely did not expect this - we have shot up by over 200 commits in a matter of days! What the fuck has happened here? Well, I can exclusively reveal that both the 
NT Advent Calendar and the NT Santa Tracker are now live, with only minor polishings needed. Merry Christmas!

### v.1541: 'NT Santa Tracker'
It is live! The NT Santa Tracker is now finally complete! Xi 4 is now also complete, along with most of Sampi 7 and some of ∮1dx. The NT Advent Calendar is almost finished 
as we count down to Christmas. Merry Christmas from all of us at Nutty Trains, and a Happy 2022! Let the nuttiness continue!

### v.1603: 'Next train staaping Camborrrne is NTCI 2, me loverr!'
Well this has been a while. James' remaining diss work and Matthew's will to live are both almost 0 as we enter March. It has been a fairly quiet period for NT. Too much 
drowning to do much else. KX has now been started, and Koppa 8, Sampi 7, Digamma 2 and Koppa 9 are now all complete! We are now gearing up once more for a flurry of 
adventures; Koppa 11, NT Orphan 1 and ∮2dy. It is showtime as usual on all the main bits of the website, except we now introduce to the world the NT Orphanage, for all the 
lost little adventures that have no fwiends. We actually have some real content on our youtube channel too for the first time in months - go and check that out! Otherwise, 
stay tuned for our Holy Trinity of Easter adventures, and don't forget that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Crossrail is opening soon!</a>

### v.1636: 'RIP Chinglish Stations and RIP Tube'
It was a good run while it lasted, Chinglish Stations, but it is time we put this horrific experiment to bed. Let's face it, it is never going to happen. As of Koppa 13, 
the tube is _finally_ complete, after almost 3 years of trying. ∮1dx, KX, K11 and K12 have all now been written up, leaving only ∮2dy, Ξ5 and ϙ13 on the to-do list. Please 
watch our videos - James has made enormous progress there too, reaching Sampi 7. The summer is young yet.
