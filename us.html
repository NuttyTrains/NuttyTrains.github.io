		<h1>About Us</h1>
    	<p> 
		We should probably introduce ourselves. Hello, we are James and Matthew, but seeing as you are here, you probably already knew that. 
	    We met in secondary school, and bonded during maths, Latin and ICT lessons. We are both primarily mathematicians, and we are now 
	    both studying for maths degrees, Matthew in Imperial, and James in Exeter. We both learned to speak Latin, despite being told 
	    explicitly by our Latin teacher not to (although Matthew's is now rusty, and James's was questionable from the start). We also 
	    both enjoy coding, although that was James's territory of expertise, but Matthew is improving. 
		<br><br>
	    For the avoidance of any doubt, we are <strong>NOT</strong> trainspotters. We find railways fascinating; the lines, the stations, 
		the destinations, the way that the whole network links together, and the joys of travelling by train - not just the locomotives. Most of 
		all, we love the inevitable mistakes that we witness on our adventures. And there are lots of them! 
		<br><br>
	    James was hooked after a trip to London on a HST, having been on a train only once before. He was happy to see the introduction 
	    of the IET Class 800s and will be sad to see the end of the Pacers... if they ever leave. Before he knew it he was mourning the 
	    loss of Arriva Trains Wales. Ave Arriva! Matthew, having convinced James of the superiority of trains, had had many adventures 
	    on the trains and his fascination was accentuated by seeing trains everyday going past at college.
		<br><br>
	    Our precursors to NT began in Year 10, but it took until upper sixth form for the real adventures to start. Soon, the call of the 
		valleys became too great, and we set off on our first nutty train adventure together. Along the way, we decided to transform this one-off 
		adventure into a ginormous project - Nutty Trains! We spent our remaining time in sixth form going on plenty of interesting adventures 
		across South Wales, and starting to venture beyond, ticking off every station in the area apart from one. 
		<br><br>
		We spent 2019/2020 in our respective universities, meeting up occasionally in London for Koppa adventures. James spent his time 
		in Cornwall, waiting endlessly for slow, shitty trains on the Cornish valley lines (it's a pity trains don't stop Camborne Wednesdays), 
		meanwhile Matthew travelled back and forth on the Tube every day, and lived next to the Central line. Matthew returned home to South Wales when 
		chock struck, and James remained in Cornwall. That summer, we went on toned-down, semi-covid-safe adventures in South Wales, before we both headed 
		back to uni. Once again, James was in Camborne, and Matthew was in London, before moving back to South Wales in Lockdown 3, and then travelling 
		to London once more for exams.
		<br><br>
		Nowadays, we are both far more into coding than we used to be. We have both coded many twitter bots (the results of which can be seen on the left), 
		and continue to develop websites, whilst James dedicates most of his coding time to Lean. Otherwise, in our spare time, Matthew procrastinates and 
		keeps up with the world of spaceflight, whilst James is a budding mathematical communicator, has appeared on a radio show, gives lectures and 
		presentations to undergrads online, and teaches Lean courses in Exeter. He is also writing a book!
		<br><br>
		As of writing this, we are both drowning under complex analysis, differential equations and linear algebra, trying to prepare for second year exams. 
		We plan future adventures and make twitter bots to keep ourselves sane. We look forward to many adventures in future, and will try to keep this 
	    website updated! Ave Arriva!
