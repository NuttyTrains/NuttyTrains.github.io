    <p> Well, you've found us. Welcome to the bastion of nuttiness that is Nutty Trains! You're probably going to regret finding us. <br><br>
            <img width="40%" align="right" src="./resources/photos/Aberdare.jpeg">
	    Here we record all of our nutty adventures together. Think of this website as the diary of our alter-egos, hidden behind layers 
	    of stuffiness, awkwardness and maths. Our insane alter-egos. These are not normal adventures, where we have a jolly day out, 
	    perhaps by the sea, or to a cafe to have tea. No. Our adventures involve visiting random run-down places, excessive running, 
	    plenty of mockery and scorn, and trains. So many trains. <br><br>
	    We should probably introduce ourselves. Hello, we are James and Matthew, but seeing as you are here, you probably already knew that. 
	    We met in secondary school, and bonded during maths, Latin and ICT lessons. We are both primarily mathematicians, and we are now 
	    both studying for maths degrees, Matthew in Imperial, and James in Exeter. We both learned to speak Latin, despite being told 
	    explicitly by our Latin teacher not to (although Matthew's is now rusty, and James's was questionable from the start). We also 
	    both enjoy coding, although that is firmly James's territory of expertise. <br><br>
	    Finally, we are self-pronounced railway addicts, not trainspotters. We feel as if we ought to stress this point. Our adventures 
	    <em> do not </em> consist of standing by some track, watching trains for hours, noting down serial numbers. We aren't interested 
	    in that. Whilst we both find trains cool (years of Thomas the Tank Engine will do that to you), our fascination is with the railway, 
	    not just the trains. We are interested in the lines, the stations, the destinations, the network, the trains and the inevitable 
	    mistakes that we witness on our adventures. And there are lots of them! <br><br>
	    James was hooked after a trip to London on a HST, having been on a train only once before. He was happy to see the introduction 
	    of the IET Class 800s and will be sad to see the end of the Pacers... if they ever leave. Before he knew it he was mourning the 
	    loss of Arriva Trains Wales. Ave Arriva! Matthew, having convinced James of the superiority of trains, had had many adventures 
	    on the trains and his fascination was accentuated by seeing trains everyday going past at college. It got to the point that he was 
	    telling the time from watching the trains! Matthew is also incredibly lazy, and may or may not have copied and pasted this entire 
	    section from the main page.<br><br>
	    Our precursors to NT began in Year 10, but it took until upper sixth form for the real adventures to start.
	    Soon, the call of the valleys became too great, and we set off on our first nutty train adventure together. Along the way, we 
	    decided to transform this one-off adventure into a ginormous project. What could this project possibly be? Well some people 
	    challenge themselves to go to every station in the UK. Together, in December 2018, we set off to do that very thing. We would 
	    visit every station in the UK, (at some point in the possibly distant future), according to our own set of particular rules! <br><br>
            Fast forward a few months, and James is busy pottering about on his Cornish valley lines (it's a 
	    pity trains don't stop at his home station on a Wednesday), meanwhile Matthew is zipping about on the Tube every 
	    day, and actually lives next to the Central line. We look forward to many adventures in future, and will keep this 
	    website updated! Ave Arriva!</p>
