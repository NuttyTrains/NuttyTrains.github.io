    <h1 class= "spacing"> Welcome to Nutty Trains! </h1>
    <p> Well, you've found us. Welcome to the bastion of nuttiness that is Nutty Trains! You're probably going to regret finding us. <br><br>
            <img width="40%" align="right" src="./resources/photos/Aberdare.jpeg">
	    Here we record all of our nutty adventures together. Think of this website as the diary of our alter-egos, hidden behind layers 
	    of stuffiness, awkwardness and maths. Our insane alter-egos. These are not normal adventures, where we have a jolly day out, 
	    perhaps by the sea, or to a cafe to have tea. No. Our adventures involve visiting random run-down places, excessive running, 
	    plenty of mockery and scorn, and trains. So many trains. <br><br>
	    We should probably introduce ourselves. Hello, we are James and Matthew, but seeing as you are here, you probably already knew that. 
	    We met in secondary school, and bonded during maths, Latin and ICT lessons. We are both primarily mathematicians, and we are now 
	    both studying for maths degrees, Matthew in Imperial, and James in Exeter. We both learned to speak Latin, despite being told 
	    explicitly by our Latin teacher not to (although Matthew's is now rusty, and James's was questionable from the start). We also 
	    both enjoy coding, although that is firmly James's territory of expertise. <br><br>
	    Finally, we are self-pronounced railway addicts, not trainspotters. We feel as if we ought to stress this point. Our adventures 
	    <em> do not </em> consist of standing by some track, watching trains for hours, noting down serial numbers. We aren't interested 
	    in that. Whilst we both find trains cool (years of Thomas the Tank Engine will do that to you), our fascination is with the railway, 
	    not just the trains. We are interested in the lines, the stations, the destinations, the network, the trains and the inevitable 
	    mistakes that we witness on our adventures. And there are lots of them! <br><br>
	    James was hooked after a trip to London on a HST, having been on a train only once before. He was happy to see the introduction 
	    of the IET Class 800s and will be sad to see the end of the Pacers... if they ever leave. Before he knew it he was mourning the 
	    loss of Arriva Trains Wales. Ave Arriva! Matthew, having convinced James of the superiority of trains, had had many adventures 
	    on the trains and his fascination was accentuated by seeing trains everyday going past at college. It got to the point that he was 
	    telling the time from watching the trains! Matthew is also incredibly lazy, and may or may not have copied and pasted this entire 
	    section from the main page.<br><br>
	    Our precursors to NT began in Year 10, but it took until upper sixth form for the real adventures to start.
	    Soon, the call of the valleys became too great, and we set off on our first nutty train adventure together. Along the way, we 
	    decided to transform this one-off adventure into a ginormous project. What could this project possibly be? Well some people 
	    challenge themselves to go to every station in the UK. Together, in December 2018, we set off to do that very thing. We would 
	    visit every station in the UK, (at some point in the possibly distant future), according to our own set of particular rules! <br><br>
        Fast forward a few months, and James is busy pottering about on his Cornish valley lines (it's a 
	    pity trains don't stop at his home station on a Wednesday), meanwhile Matthew is zipping about on the Tube every 
	    day, and actually lives next to the Central line. We look forward to many adventures in future, and will keep this 
	    website updated! Ave Arriva!</p>

	  <p>
		When we were initially drawing up our list of stations, life was really, really easy - we just noted them down in the order we visited them, and Bob's 
		your uncle. However, when the scope of our adventures progressed from a couple of ad hoc visits to shitty valleys or picturesque country lines, past 
		visiting all the stations within South Wales or Wales, and onto visiting every single NR station in the UK, suddenly the way in which we enumerated 
		and kept track of stations began to matter. Fortunately, we were still confined to South Wales, where we could more or less keep track of them 
		mentally - these were our local railways, and we were becoming somewhat experts about the rolling stock, service patterns, stations and even history. 
		<br><br>
		This changed when we reached London, which is a far different beast. We had already had to strip the 3 tube stations (enumerated 1, 1a & 1b) out of 
		our list of NR stations so as to ensure that we kept an accurate count of our NR stations, which led to the creation of a separate table for tube 
		stations. Fantastic. However, when drawing up the rules for London stations, ahead of our first London adventure, Matthew started to get concerned 
		as to how subtle and nuanced a lot of the distinctions between stations could be. This is why the rules for the London adventures have to be listed 
		in such greater detail.
		<br><br>
		Firstly, only London Underground, DLR, London Overground and TfL Rail/Crossrail/Elizabeth line stations qualify under London rules. When 
		complete, we ought to have visited a total of 270 London Underground, 45 DLR, 112 London Overground and 41 Elizabeth Line stations, 
		although this number is subject to change as new stations are constructed and added to the network. Initially, we thought it would be amusing to add 
		all the stations together into an enormous TfL list, but after Ï™3, Matthew decided that this would in fact be impossible, and that a new approach was 
		needed. Hence, in order to ensure that we complete all the stations on each of the networks, Matthew divided up the TfL stations table.
		<br><br>
		We will double-count Overground and Elizabeth line stations as NR stations, meaning they will appear in both tables. Our methodology for counting DLR, 
		and Elizabeth line stations is straightforward and our methodology for counting Overground stations is also simple, except we shall also count 
		Battersea Park, as it qualifies as an Overground station, despite not appearing on the map. As for tube stations, to reach the full 270, we will follow 
		the customary methodology of counting Bank and Monument separately, and double-counting Edgware Road, Hammersmith and Paddington. 
		<br><br>
		Addendum: I am quite proud that I pre-empted Geoff here with my note on Paddington. Clearly he has read this website!
