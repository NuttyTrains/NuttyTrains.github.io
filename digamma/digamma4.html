<p> We are back for our final UK adventure of 2024 - it's been a good run lads, but all things must come to an end... 
    sanity, PhDs and DJI Camera 2021-2024.

    After sobering up after Usman's birthday (see Koppa 18), we headed back to Oxford station to begin the long, long trek to Salisbury. 
    The goal today was to mop up the 'Salisbury Quadrilateral' (below), and to have a nice day out in Salisbury... hahaha

    It all started pretty smoothly - we caught a train to Reading, walked to the river Thames, admired the boats and made plans 
    for NT Canal 1: coming to a boat near you in the 2030s! But trouble was brewing - the trains had been ruined across the network 
    yesterday, when <i>Matthew</i> had been in charge. Today was <i>James'</i> day in charge... oh no. <i>Oh no...</i>
    <br><br>
    We caught a direct train from Reading to Bournemouth - slow, but serviceable. Little did we realise that this would be the only useful 
    train all day...
