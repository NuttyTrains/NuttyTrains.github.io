<p> We are back for our final UK adventure of 2024 - it's been a good run lads, but all things must come to an end... 
    sanity, PhDs and DJI Camera 2021-2024.
    <br><br>
    After sobering up after Usman's birthday (see Koppa 18), we headed back to Oxford station to begin the long, long trek to Salisbury. 
    The goal today was to mop up the 'Salisbury Quadrilateral' (below), and to have a nice day out in Salisbury... hahaha

    It all started pretty smoothly - we caught a train to Reading, walked to the river Thames, admired the boats and made plans 
    for NT Canal 1: coming to a boat near you in the 2030s! But trouble was brewing - the trains had been ruined across the network 
    yesterday, when <i>Matthew</i> had been in charge. Today was <i>James'</i> day in charge... oh no. <i>Oh no...</i>
    <br><br>
    We caught a direct train from Reading to Bournemouth - slow, but serviceable. Little did we realise that this would be the only useful 
    train all day...
    <br><br>
    After about 2 hours or so on the train, we finally arrived in Salisbury on a reasonably hot day. We left the station and ended 
    up in a dodgy bit of town. James rejected Matthew's proposed 'Kquality' classification system for fine dining establishments... 
    then proceeded to talk about Syphax in front of some kind of memorial.
    <br><br>
    Salisbury was actually quite nice, unlike Bedford last time. We walked along some pretty canals, headed through the quaint 
    town centre, and headed for the magnificent gothic cathedral, which was amazing. Welcome back to the NT PILgrimage, coming 
    soon to a Southwestern cathedral near you!
    <br><br>
    As we decided to not pay the expensive entry fee, we walked past the theological college (and the school where William Golding 
    taught) and headed back to the town centre. Here there were some children singing YMCA, but James once again denied Matthew's 
    request to add to our royalty-free library of music. We instead headed to a nice pub, had some decent wine, and a 2 hour lunch, 
    whilst we planned our escape.
    <br><br>
    ...this would be a problem.
    <br><br>
    There were hardly any trains to London. James insisted that "trains don't run down south on Sundays", but even they were 
    baffled as we saw the extent of the problem. There was one train that headed to Basingstoke in about half an hour, followed 
    by nothing. The astute reader may recall that we had started this adventure intending to complete "the quadrilateral", but 
    it turns out that completing this route would be nearly impossible on a good day... and this was not a good day. There were 
    no trains running via the Newbury line, no trains running from Bristol Temple Meads, and no trains running via Bristol Parkway... 
    for the next 3 hours - what the fuck? Furthermore, the line that formed the upper edge of the quadrilateral was completely 
    nonsensical - you have to take at least 3 different services, doubling back in places, just to complete what should be 
    a simple journey - thanks to the lack of trains today, this would be a problem for future James and Matthew.
    <br><br>
    Therefore, with the grand total of 5 stations under our belt, we decided to tick off 1 more long-standing desired NT destination 
    - the chock bench.
    <br><br>
    <strong>I'm not sitting there - somebody died here</strong>
    <br><br>
    We returned to the station, and Matthew asked what on earth had happened to the trains. He was told that everything was fine, 
    with the exception of our tickets, which were not valid on the quadrilateral anyway. So there you have it folks - don't spend 
    £40 on an Oxford-Salisbury return and expect to get more than 5 stations under your belt - the top edge of that quadrilateral 
    costs £50 alone!
    <br><br>
    Angry and miserable, we returned to Basingstoke - which made us more angry and miserable. Basingstoke is a horrific place, 
    where Matthew has previously abandoned James for hours on end. Seeing it yet again made Matthew very remorseful for his 
    previous actions (see Koppa 18 and a selection of unwritten adventures that Matthew may or may not resurrect at some point). 
    At least we had time for a Schack Zone<sup>TM</sup>.
    <br><br>
    We returned to Reading, marking the end of NT 2024. See you for another suburban nightmare in 2025...
