  The next train to arrive at PLATFORM DAI will be the DIGAMMA 1 service to BRIZZLE, calling at TAUNTON, WESTON-SUPER-MARE, ANTI-POLICE VIOLENCE-PROTEST, and CHOCK. 
  PLATFORM DAI for the DIGAMMA 1 service to BRIZZLE.
  <br><br>
  On this edition of Springwatch, we check in on James's friend, Meal Deal the dead pigeon, we spy on various birds minding their own business in a park, TweetyBoi 
  pesters us and malfunctions all day, and we take a close look at Matthew's Seagull Trap (patent pending) that is taking Camborne by storm!
</p>
<p>
  We travelled halfway across the country on the train to meet up for the first time in 7 months, which was very exhiliarating.
  We wandered around Taunton lost, had coffee, wandered around the multi-storey car park and saw a dead pigeon. We walked quickly to the seaside in Weston, then 
  walked quickly back. Then in Bristol we saw "2+2=5" spray-painted everywhere, wandered around the shopping centre, had pizza in the park, laughed at some seagulls, 
  walked to the uni and walked back to the train station, where Matthew opened one of his birthday presents from James. And as ever we spent the train journey jumping 
  on and off and filming shit!
  <br><br>
  Towards the end of the spring term, we decided that we needed another NT adventure in order to retain our sanity, but thanks to Kernow trains not reaching London 
  Wednesdays, James couldn't make it to London, where Matthew was shortly moving back to. Hence, we decided to meet in Somerrrrset and Brizzle, and Matthew came up 
  with one of his amazingly convoluted plans to save 2p on tickets. Soon, Matthew was back in London, and the countdown to NT œù1 began!

  <p> Hey, James here, deciding to start writing this one as editing the video wants to make me jump onto the rails and end it all, it may also be that I only had seven hours sleep
  last night. Let's start there, so I was up last night preparing everything that I needed for the trip, the comprehensive list includes; 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Laptop</li>
    <li>Laptop Charger</li>
    <li>Sandwiches and associated food</li>
    <li>Flask, tea bags, milk and cup</li>
    <li>Pens, paper, textbooks, notes and brain</li>
    <li>Earphones</li>
    <li>Myself</li>
    <li>Matthews present(s)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    And last but not least a working twitter bot, this bot was <em>supposed</em> to tweet out when we were at certain stations. It didn't. There are a lot of bugs in the 
    thing and it deserves to go to hell as I was working on it for hours last night. So I went to bed at approximately midnight and woke up at seven and got to the station 
    at 0910 and printed my tickets this was the first strike of the day; the tickets were wrong. So I queued up and waited to get the changed to get the correct ones, so I waited
    and I waited, and I waited, and I waited, ..., and then the attendant turned up and I got them changed, however, it took a good 30 minutes. 30 MINUTES. 30 MINUTES to change some 
    tickets. I was only going to Brizzle! 
  <br><br>
    James got on the train and got quite a bit of work done, including firing up TweetyBoi, who then malfunctioned on the entire journey down, tweeting out completely 
    inaccurate stations for hours on end. Matthew, meanwhile, had arrived at PAD a few minutes before his train was due to arrive (rare), only to find that his train was 
    nowhere to be seen! He had to wait 10 minutes for it to show up - how awful (for a Londoner)! Eventually it showed its sorry face, and Matthew took the 90 minute journey 
    to Brizzle, watching a complex analysis lecture on the way. He changed trains at Brizzle to a Castle Class (which had a socket, to his great surprise), after having a short 
    walk around Brizzle, calling James, and yelling at some random guy drilling a hole in the floor with a jackhammer. Here we shall treat you, the reader, to some of 
    TweetyBoi's fantastic handiwork:

    VRRRMMMMMM we fast forward to James arriving in Taunton via some chickens in pens made out of portable metal railings. James had a wonderful idea, for Matthew, who 
    was on an earlier train, had surely arrived. Hence, James ran across every platform looking for Matthew, and when he couldn't see him, got very very confused. Where 
    was Matthew? James then felt a Castle Class arriving, ah, there's Matthew. James was on the opposite platform, so with his 10 tonne bag, so we know the routine... RUN. 
    James jumped down a flight of stairs and plodded up another just as the roaring Castle Class slumps into the station. James waited into the center of the platform as 
    he expected Matthew to appear there, however, Matthew appeared from the front of the train. It was a long time since we have done NT, so we were both looking forward 
    to this! Genbatte NT!
  <br><br>
    So it was time to get going around Taunton as Matthew had a tight plan, we had 90 minutes in Taunton and so we ran off to explore Taunton. So we scanned our tickets 
    (after James losing his tickets). Just after we left the station, we made a friend. Our friend was Meal Deal. This is what Meal Deal looked like, possibly a few days 
    before Digamma 1, and when we met Meal Deal, we <strong>could</strong> recreate this absolute gem;
  </p>

  <p>
    So, we continued into Taunton. Taunton was a long way from the station, but we walked none the less. NT Adventures are seeming to now contain a ludicruous amount of 
    walking, but we wanted a coffee, so we wanted somewhere nice. Taunton ended up being quite nice. We went past a dodgy diner that would most definitely give you something 
    worse than COVID, then over the river and into the centre of Taunton. We went and saw the bussling streets of an upmarket and central south west town. We were in James' 
    territory, but it seemed slightly off. It wasn't like his lovely and amazing Kernow. We found a Cafe Nero, after wandering around Taunton about three times, completing lap 
    after lap of the town centre, before deciding that we had completed the whole town centre and looking for something else to do. The Cafe Nero we visited was a 
    very nice Cafe Nero, it was in an old Tudor house. This was when Matthew tightened his gaze on James to see what weird and wonderful thing that James was to order. James 
    watched the menu and decided that a Cortado sounded nice, so he donned his more South West accent and asked for a Cortaaaaaaaaaado. The woman behind the desk gave him a 
    look and then went to prepare his drink. Matthew then decided that it was more sensible to just have a Cappuccino. We took our drinks and went off to find somewhere nice to 
    sit. Remember that river from earlier? It was time for some nice nutty trains schenanigans.
    <br><br>
    We wandered over to the little riverside park to 'enjoy' our coffee. Matthew's sleep schedule was as fucked as ever, so he desperately needed his in order to stay alive, so 
    he chugged it in one go. We wandered around the greenery, filming whatever shit came up in front of us - trees, a dirty stream, and of course: birds. Nutty Birds.
    <br><br>
    We filmed a seagull trying to eat itself, a crow slamming its head against the ground, and a duck minding its own business - welcome to Nutty Trains Springwatch!
    <br><br>
    <strong>Usually we'd put a camera in the nest, but they all died <br>
    Illi vitae <br>
    There weren't many trains to film on this adventure, so we filmed birds instead <br>
    We can't call it 'Nutty Birds' though <br>
    That sounds like a cheap porno </strong>
    <br><br>
    We continued testing out the cameras, being IPNs, littering in the river and filming utter shite, all whilst pumping out other iconic quotes:
    <br><br>
    <strong>Who says we cant do it twice... why is the ground moving? <br>
    It's just like ffynone, but with coffee </strong>
    <br><br>
    We returned to Taunton town centre, bypassing the quaint village shops and the old town centre, and headed to seek out the holy grail of NT: the multi-storey car park. 
    Before long, we had made our first attempt - the Sainsbury's car park, with 2 storeys. We wandered around aimlessly, decided that we could improve upon this, and thus 
    walked backwards up the staircase out. We walked along a narrow pavement by a main road, attempting to be hit by a car, before entering the multi-storey car park, and 
    sprinting up the staircase, almost bowling over the small children in our way, and 'counting' the stairs of the 15 storey building on the way up, just like Geoff! 
    <i>We are coming for your views Geoff!</i>
    <br><br>
    The multi-storey car park was pretty average. We'd seen better. Maybe a 6/10. The view was alright. Might buy again.
    <br><br>
    We quickly made our way back through the town centre, making fun of Scott and Devo, before passing our fwiend, MEAL DEAL! After James almost lost all his possessions 
    in his pockets, he eventually found his ticket, and we raced up the stairs only to find the train was delayed. <i>Trains don't 'rive on time down Sowff!</i> Please 
    enjoy this magnificent video of our fallen friend MEAL DEAL (Snack and Drink required - please submit CVs below):

    We then set off on our quest to tick off all the stations on the line. We caught the train up to Weston-super-Mare, at which point we would transfer to the slower, 
    shitty train, to tick off all the crappy halts on the rest of the line. In order to do this, we set the bot army off, including our other friend, TweetyBoi!<br>
    ....<br>
    Except TweetyBoi said no. TweetyBoi said 'BB Me No Tweety'. Time, and time again. The one time we needed him, he fucked himself and went to die in a hole. So we 
    had to make do with our other bots, and 'bots':

    After a short trip, where TweetyBoi was no help at all, we had jumped on and off at 3 stations, filming each one, before arriving in Weston-super-Mare, and leaving 
    our Castle Class train behind. We then set off towards the beach, to enjoy all of our 25 minutes there, walking to the beach, and immediately walking back. We passed 
    more than 1 multi-storey car park (looked about a 5/10), sprinted across a main road, attempting to be hit by a speeding car, and stood by the beach, looking disdainfully 
    at the plebs on the beach, and comparing the place to Barry Island, the world's 'best'<sup>TM</sup> seaside resort. We walked back through the town at a rate of knots, 
    looking all around us to see signs of Big Brother watching us (he was everywhere - the Chinese takeaway, the Winston cafe, and the weed farm opposite the library), before 
    passing the council estate and re-entering the station, and boarding a new, even crappier train than before. We just sat there for about 10 minutes before the driver 
    could be arsed to leave the station. With that, NT was on the move again! ... without TweetyBoi, who was still shitting himself.
    <br><br>
    It wasn't too long before Matthew and James started shitting themselves though. We were barely out of Weston before we reached Worle, which had a station sign the size 
    of a postcard. We both stepped out onto the platform, and James lost his mind and started sprinting maniacally up and down the platform looking for the sign, but to 
    no avail. Fortunately though, this wasn't the valleys, where they'd nick the sign to use as a knife in the daily chav-baiting arena match in Merthyr Tydfil (tickets cost 
    only 0.1 'Druth's of Cw√¢c - what a bargain!), so the sign was still there - just James was too dyslexic to see it!

  <p>
    We kept jumping on and off, much to the annoyance and confusion of the other passengers, all along the line. The conductor worked out our little game at Yatton, we 
    swore in front of some little children at Nailsea and Backwell, and we got frustrated behind some slow woman at Parson Street. All this time, Matthew was wedging 
    himself into tiny cubbyholes in the train, and James was ripping his shoulder off. We almost killed some young yobs on bikes at Bedminster, then finally pulled into 
    Brizzle, our final station for the day.
  </p>
  <center><img src="../resources/photos/Bristol TM.jpg" width="55%"></center>
  <p>
    We then left the station, and entered art student territory <i>hisses</i>. If we had invented the magnificent game of art student bingo by this point, then we 
    would have absolutely spent our time playing this game - it is just too easy in Brizzle, because the place is infested with them, fucking each other in every 
    student dorm in the city centre.
    <br><br>
    You know what else Brizzle city centre is infested with? Massive motorways. Everywhere. Just waiting for you to be run over. Noice.
    <br><br>
    As you will have now read, we spent our entire journey through Weston-super-Mare trying to evade the watchful eye of Big Brother, who was watching our every move. 
    But as we walked up towards the city centre, we realised that we was well and truly watching us, now and always... <strong>'2+2=5'</strong> was painted on a nearby 
    wall. This caused Matthew and James to have a mental breakdown on a street corner. Matthew and James love Big Brother.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Who needs Church when you've got this Bible?<br>
    True implies false, it is antisymmetric</strong>
    <br><br>
    Eventually we escaped the twin dangers of art students and roads (but never BB), and walked straight into the third and final danger: the chock. Brizzle was absolutely 
    packed for poor old rural James, and it was also packed full of chock. Matthew on the other hand darted straight into the crowd, hoping to breathe in as many chock 
    particles as he could, and hopefully also get stabbed at the same time.
    <br><br>
    We walked around Brizzle city centre in circles, with an increasingly hungry, irate and scared chockless James, looking for dinner, but finding only chock. He pulled out 
    his phone to try and find a restaurant, which lead us to Cabot Circus. Here, we found no food at all, but we did find something better: an old codger singing Beatles 
    music for us, completely out of time. It was utterly sublime! We was absolutely begging us to film him, as he took his shirt off in the middle of the street and 
    started pelting out another 'song'. The very least we could do was film him and use his music in our video (see below)!
    <br><br>
    We eventually headed back towards a shopping centre, got confused by the one-way escalator system, and headed up to Pizza Express on the top floor - ooh it felt good 
    to be back. Unfortunately, this was chock times, so we couldn't go into order, or sit in to eat. We ordered outside (I have no idea what we ordered), bought some 
    refreshments from the shop after ignoring social distancing, fucked up the escalators yet again, and then collected our pizzas, to head for a nearby park.
    <br><br>
    We walked back through the chock-filled streets, burning hot pizzas in hand, before passing a hotel that James had stayed at. We were just about to cross the road into 
    the park, when:
    <br><br>
    <strong>It ain't over until the fat lady cycles past playing reggae music.</strong>
    <br><br>
    True story that. True story.
    <br><br>
    We sat on a rock, laughing about the shitty way that we treat every NT destination, whilst James choked down his super hot pizza (again), and we watched two seagulls 
    team up to attack a nearby bin, then attempted to fight to the death over their magnificent haul of food - 1 McDonalds chip. What made it worse was that the two 
    seagulls were mother and child - that is the way of the gull. Amen.
    <br><br>
    Inspired by this, Matthew decided to design the greatest innovation of the century. Forget the iPhone, forget Facebook, forget Dogecoin. The true groundbreaker here 
    is Matthew's Seagull Trap (patent pending). Constructing this trap is easy and simple - even in the developing world! 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Step 1: Finish your pizza</li>
    <li>Step 2: Use the empty box to pick up a McDonalds chips container, with a few tasty morsels inside</li>
    <li>Step 3: Ram the box into the bin at an awkward angle</li>
    <li>Step 4: Prise the box open, into a jaw-like shape, tempting the seagull in with its tasty contents, like a Venus Fly Trap</li>
    <li>Step 5: Wait for the seagull to enter the jaws and be tricked, flying in, to its doom! </li>
    <li>Step 6: ...</li>
    <li>Step 7: Profit</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, James was determined to investigate some social distancing hearts that had been spray-painted onto the grass nearby, so Matthew was unable to see his 
    trap claim its first victim. But mark my words, it will take the world by storm!
    <br><br>
    The NT schedule dictated that we should set off for the trains now, so that James could arrive back in Kernow before next week, but we felt as if we'd barely 
    seen the city, so decided to catch the next train instead, and go and explore the city for a while. For James, this meant donning his back-breakingly heavy 
    backpack once more, and to set off as Matthew dragged him all the way to the top of Clifton Hill. We walked up Christmas Stairs, which were a very pretty, narrow 
    and steep (and graffiti-filled) alleyway from the middle ages (to James' delight. We then passed <s>Colston</s> <i>Black Lives Matter</i> Hall, part of the 
    University of Bristol, before summitting the hill by the Maths department and sitting outside - a new, and very, very sad NT tradition that we seem to have fallen into. Sad.
    <br><br>
    After all this was said and done, we finally descended back down the hill, through the chock and past the art students, all the way back to the station. We headed over to 
    Matthew's platform, where his train was waiting. We had but a few more minutes before the adventure would be over, so we sat down and James gave Matthew his birthday 
    presents, about a week early. Matthew had some Cornish Shortbread (Oooh Arrgh) and a little book entitled 'How to teach your cat Welsh', which Matthew was very amused by. 
    <br><br>
    Finally, Matthew boarded his (extremely packed) train and headed back to PAD, spending most of the journey home asleep, and watching most of his devices die on him. 
    He was lucky he wasn't in Camborne, or else they'd have been nicked!
    <br><br>
    Eventually, we woke up in time to taunt James that he was nearly home (James was barely in Devon), before taking the tube all the way across London to meet Freya and 
    attempt to avoid being force-fed pizza on a street corner in front of a live audience. What an end to such a day.
