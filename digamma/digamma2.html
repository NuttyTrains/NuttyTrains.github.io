<p>Going to Bristol's most notorious and least used station with two trains a week, all while Bristols train network
    falls to bits around them? Honestly, I cannot think of a better idea!
</p>

<ul>
    <li>James arrives at bus stop 15 minutes before his bus, it doesnt turn up</li>
    <li>No busses turn up</li>
    <li>James tries a taxi, none.</li>
    <li>James screams in a lot of pain.</li>
    <li>James wants to off himself.</li>
    <li>James gets on the 0943 to Newport</li>
    <li>James gets stared at by, an admittedly, attractive redhead. James is trying to their number theory problem sheet. 
        He isn't impressed</li>
    <li>James arrives at Newport after screaming at this problem for an hour and a half and tutting repeatedly</li>
    <li>James changes for the Great Malvern train (excuse me, what?)</li>
    <li>James gets off a BPW and dies a little at the amount of people</li>
    <li>They decide to get a bus, and go to the wrong bustop. </li>
    <li>He misses the bus, swear and go and try and get the bus connection by foot.</li>
    <li>He also misses this and ends up ealking by a pond.</li>
    <li>They decide to go back to the station and just get on the train</li>
    <li>Another girl gawks at James, and women are the ones complaining?! Do one, I'm reading my diss book, stop smiling
        sweetly at me foul temptress.
    </li>
    <li>James makes it to meads, meets Matthew, who runs off out of a unknown exit and just starts heading towards LWH</li>
    <li>We overshoot LWH</li>
    <li>Think we have 3 when we have 13 minutes so sprint it</li>
    <li>Get on train, after looking at the edibles.</li>
    <li>Do jumpy on and off to Clifton</li>
    <li>See bridge, after walking past the zoo</li>
    <li>Go down a vertical gorge, and cross a road to realise we can't cross back</li>
    <li>James has heart palpatations and just can't walk</li>
    <li>Miss train, both very angry</li>
    <li>James has food, Matthew has snack. Matthew learns an important lesson, don't drink when you are tired.</li>
</ul>
