<p> Going to Bristol's most notorious and least used station with two trains a week, all while Bristols train network
    falls to bits around them? Honestly, I cannot think of a better idea!
    <br><br>
    Let's just start this account with the standard disclaimer that this was not planned well. Not at all. Why we chose this date, I do not know. Neither does James - he 
    had already attempted to do this adventure solo the week before, which would have been a much smarter date to do this. Whilst Digamma 1.9 was mostly a write off, and 
    James failed to reach Pilning, so ended up just going home, that was better than what we faced on Digamma 2: the entire rail network in Brizzle being a complete write-off. 
    This was going to be fun!
    <br><br>
    As seems to be a tradition for adventures where Matthew has to travel across the country, Matthew had failed to sleep the night before, so was going to try and conduct 
    this adventure fuelled entirely by iced coffee. He caught the train from Paddington and headed to Brizzle on the gay train (800008: everyone's favourite!). A completely 
    uneventful, on-time journey. If only the same could be same for James... 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>James arrives at bus stop 15 minutes before his bus, it doesnt turn up</li>
    <li>No busses turn up</li>
    <li>James tries a taxi, none.</li>
    <li>James screams in a lot of pain.</li>
    <li>James wants to off himself.</li>
    <li>James gets on the 0943 to Newport</li>
    <li>James gets stared at by, an admittedly, attractive redhead. James is trying to do their number theory problem sheet. 
        He isn't impressed</li>

<p>
    So Matthew arrived in Brizzle and then had to wait for the next >2 hours for James to arrive. James' phone was almost as dead as Matthew was, so James requested that 
    Matthew pick him up a charger. Thus, Matthew's first course of action was to head south from Temple Meads, cross the river, and head toward Bedminster. Once this 
    task was complete, he crossed back across the Avon, and headed towards the old docks. Here, he stopped off at what had been secretly planned to be our first stop: 
    a ship called The Matthew. This ship was sailed by John Cabot across the Atlantic when he discovered Newfoundland in 1497. Matthew said this all on camera for a video 
    segment, but James may or may not be interested in 'accurate' information. Matthew also saw a sign including Stephen the seagull, which seemed very appropriate for NT.
    <br><br>
    Matthew then started to return to Temple Meads, via the outskirts of the city centre, and via Castle Park. He walked alongside the river and along the side of the huge 
    road leading back to the station. Just as he was about to reach Temple Meads, he came across possibly the most traumatising sight he has ever seen... 
    <br><br>
    <strong>A seagull eating a Meal Deal</strong>
    <br><br>
    It was awful. Terrible. Revolting. The seagulls dragged Meal Deal's poor and sorry carcass around, ripping chunks off and almost severing its head... all on camera for 
    our valued viewers! It traumatised Matthew to film, and traumatised James to edit, so now it can traumatise you as you watch it. Enjoy!

<p>
    After this horrific experience, Matthew called James only to find that James was <i>still</i> nowhere near arriving, so Matthew headed into the closest Starbucks, not for 
    coffee (surprisingly), but to use the bathroom. He stood outside the door for a full 20 minutes, as the bathroom remained occupied, until a lady customer came to also use 
    the bathroom, and taught Matthew the trick of just using a 2p coin to forcefully unlock the door from the outside, which was genius. Soon after this, Matthew returned to 
    the ticket hall in Temple Meads, and awaited James' arrival. What was James getting up to in the meantime?
</p>
<ul>
    <li>James arrives at Newport after screaming at this problem for an hour and a half and tutting repeatedly</li>
    <li>James changes for the Great Malvern train (excuse me, what?)</li>
    <li>James gets off at BPW and dies a little at the amount of people</li>
    <li>They decide to get a bus, and go to the wrong bustop. </li>
    <li>He misses the bus, swears and goes and tries to get the bus connection by foot.</li>
    <li>He also misses this and ends up walking by a pond.</li>
    <li>They decide to go back to the station and just get on the train</li>
    <li>Another girl gawks at James, and women are the ones complaining?! Do one, I'm reading my diss book, stop smiling
        sweetly at me foul temptress.
    </li>
    <li>James makes it to Temple Meads, meets Matthew, who runs off out of an unknown exit and just starts heading towards LWH</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Now that James had finally showed up, Matthew ran off straight towards and across the river, and then onwards towards a disused railway line leading towards Lawrence 
    Hill - the first station after Brizzle Temple Meads on the Severn Beach line. On any other weekend, this would have been easy - we would have merely <i>caught</i> 
    this train from Temple Meads. But today, the line from Temple Meads to Parkway was completely and utterly kill. This is what had caused James to catch an unusual 
    combination of trains to Brizzle, and this is what had forced James to wait for over an hour in Parkway for the extremely rare trains travelling to Temple Meads. 
    The line that our original plans had so heavily relied upon was as good as closed today, and so as soon as James made it through this blockade once, we essentially 
    decided that attempting to travel on this line a second time was a lost cause. If we were getting to Lawrence Hill, we were walking.
    <br><br>
    And so we did. We walked along the dodgy disused railway line, past some dodgy 60s building, and under some bridges falling to pieces. We filmed some shit all the 
    way along the path, walking for ages and ages. We kept on walking. We thought to ourselves "wow, this path is longer than we thought" as we kept on walking. And walking. 
    We kept walking until we came to the shocking conclusion that we had in fact overshot Lawrence Hill. RIP. We turned around, looking for the exit from the path, and 
    eventually reached the exit for Lawrence Hill. Here, Matthew had a little moment, panicked, and came to the shocking conclusion that we had only 3 minutes until 
    the train was meant to depart. Thus, despite having only been going for about 15 minutes, it was time for us to tick off our perennial NT tradition for the first, 
    but not the last time this adventure: it was time to run!
    <br><br>
    We sprinted all the way to the station, and only when we had made it the whole way did Matthew check his watch, come to his senses, and realise we had loads of time. 
    Matthew had his photo at <u>his</u> station (what a dump!), we admired the various edibles growing in the station planters (what was it with Brizzle stations and 
    allotments?), before getting on our train, which had been waiting for us here at Lawrence Hill thanks to line to Temple Meads being kill.
    <br><br>
    The crappy old sprinter pulled off, and it was now time for NT jumpy on and off time, all the way to Clifton Down. Now here is the same stuff in James's own words:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>We overshoot LWH</li>
    <li>Think we have 3 when we have 13 minutes so sprint it</li>
    <li>Get on train, after looking at the edibles.</li>
    <li>Do jumpy on and off to Clifton</li>
</ul>

<p>
    We jumped on and off on this valley-type line as it diverged from the mainline and headed up into the hills of Clifton. We disembarked at Clifton Down and decided to 
    head first to the zoo. That's right. We headed to the zoo. Nutty Trains goes to the zoo. Yep. Zoo time.
    <br><br>
    Zoo time was brief. This being Nutty Trains, we had no time to actually go to the zoo, no tickets, and nothing there to actually see, do or film, so we stood in the car 
    park for 30 seconds, just enough time for James to talk some shit about the place and headed off to the real target: Clifton Gorge.
    <br><br>
    This can mainly be described as a mistake, cooked up the night before by Matthew. We threw ourselves down this steep forest path, almost slipping, falling and dying on 
    more than one occasion, descending an entire cliff-face's drop down to the bottom of the gorge. We crossed the road (remember that bit), and started to walk towards 
    the suspension bridge. Truth be told, it was a magnificent walk. It may have been next to a loud and smelly road, and a foul and turbulent river, but the gorge and the 
    bridge overhead were beautiful and striking. When the clips from this adventure finally see the light of day when James gets internet in 2027, they are going to be 
    spectacular. On Digamma 3, we would very much like to return to Clifton - James to see the zoo, and Matthew to cross over the bridge itself.
    <br><br>
    Now remember when, a few lines earlier, I said that we crossed the road? Well now we had to cross back... which was not possible. The road was much busier, scarier and 
    faster-moving than it had looked on Google Maps, and even Matthew was apprehensive about crossing over to the planned staircase. So instead, we kept walking along the 
    road, along a 10 minute detour, eating precious time that we needed to return to the station before our train left.
    <br><br>
    We finally crossed the footbridge and made it to the other side of the A4, when another minor realisation struck us. Remember once again, how, just a few lines before, 
    we had thrown ourselves down the equivalent of a cliff-face? Well now we had to climb back up... 
</p>
<center><iframe id="largevid" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JM6gTmflMKk" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>
<ul>
    <li>See bridge, after walking past the zoo</li>
    <li>Go down a vertical gorge, and cross a road to realise we can't cross back</li>
    <li>James has heart palpatations and just can't walk</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Yeah, James summed that one up well: <i>James has heart palpatations and just can't walk</i>. It was a long, steep, narrow and winding climb, and we still had another 
    20 minute walk to complete in just 10 minutes by the time we had reached the top of the steep section. We came to a grinding halt and tried to flag down a taxi to 
    return us to Clifton in time, but it was all in vain. No-one stopped and our plans were ruined. We had missed the train. (Ironically, as we discovered later, if we 
    had just powered on, we would have just made it). We replotted our route, called a taxi for later (no spoilers here: keep reading!), and headed in for something to 
    eat/drink, so at least James was happy. It was food time.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Miss train, both very angry</li>
    <li>James has food, Matthew has snack. Matthew learns an important lesson, don't drink when you are tired.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Yeah, that was a surprisingly important lesson, past James. Matthew had a pint of Aspalls (a lot for him) on no sleep and very little to eat, and then was surprised 
    when it started to have a big effect on him. To make up for this, whilst James was busy nomming, Matthew headed to Tesco to stock up on even more iced coffee than he 
    had consumed on Sampi 7 - a dangerous prospect indeed. James paid, and we set out for Clifton Down once more, this time with just as little time as we had had before. 
    Brilliant stuff. Matthew downed an iced coffee (or it might have been 2), and we started to walk, then march, then jog, and finally sprint to Clifton Down station, as 
    Matthew was absolutely desperate to catch this train, and James' heart was not going to get in his way this time! We legged it up the hill along the final stretch of 
    the journey, and Matthew arrived outside the station, watching a crowd of people depart just as he arrived. No! Had Matthew managed to miss the train we so dearly needed 
    to get to Pilning on time? He ran into the station and saw no train on either platform. The tension was killing him. He turned around and saw no James either. Bugger! 
    Had James gotten lost at some point? Matthew ran back down the street until James came into sight, then whipped James' circulatory system one last time, to drag him to 
    the station on the off chance that the train was yet to arrive. Thankfully, as we jogged down the station entrance ramp to the platform, our train came trundling into view. 
    Thank God! We boarded, and sat down, coated in sweat and completely dead from the running. But we were on our way to Severn Beach. Matthew celebrated with a coffee.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>We <s>walk</s> run to Clifton Downs and just about make the train, James' heart just gives up at this point</li>
    <li>Go to Severn Beach</li>
    <li>Taxi to Pilning</li>
    <li>Pilning Time</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The stations became more infrequent as we left the city, with the times between stations roughly doubling. The allotments didn't give up though - those remained in full 
    force all the way to Severn Beach. Well, almost all the way. See, when we missed our original train, it turns out that we had also missed the train that stopped at all 
    the stations. We stood by the door after we left Avonmouth, and as the train wound its way through the world's most miserable incineration plant, eagerly awaiting the 
    train to slow down and stop at St Andrews Road. Alas, it was not to be. The train flew through the station at its maximum speed, so we watched the station sign fly past 
    the doors at 10 miles per hour. RIP St Andrews Road. Matthew was deeply upset. Now we'd have to come back to this shithole and do this whole ordeal again!
</p>
<center><iframe id="largevid" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VfQVk52J4SA" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>
<p>
    Our original plans were to be derailed further. There was no time for anything at Severn Beach, not even to go over to the 'beach' and admire the <s>horrible stinking 
    mudflats</s> beautiful sandy shores, or to talk about the Severn Bridges. We filmed the station a little, walked out the front, and immediately got into our taxi (which 
    James had called up earlier) and headed to Pilning. The driver refused to accept that Pilning station existed, but illi vitae, we were headed there anyway. It had cost an 
    arm and a leg, so we were headed there even if he claimed he had never heard of it!
    <br><br>
    Finally reaching Pilning was amazing, even if our enjoyment of the station was somewhat muted by the arrival of some hardcore trainspotters. The station entrance was rubbish 
    - quite literally. It was filled with rubbish, bin bags and detritus, which was very sad. The station was not signed well either - there was a sorry looking sign out the front, 
    but that was about it. The path up to the station itself was gravel, so not tarmacked, and the station building had long since been boarded up and vandalised. It was all very 
    sad, but seeing the abandoned platform and the lack of a footbridge was heartbreaking. It was so very clear when we arrived that Network Rail is trying to close it by stealth. 
    We had some lovely interactions with the Pilning twitter account (who now follow us and like our tweets). It is our sincere wish at NT that Pilning can become some kind of M49 
    Parkway station in the future, and that platform 1 and the footbridge will be restored at some point in the future. Hopefully it will be easier to return to by the time of 
    Digamma N.
    <br><br>
    We filmed quite of lot of stuff at Pilning, as is to be expected. The noise of the overhead wires, imperceptible to human ears, is very strong in all the clips, but hopefully 
    that doesn't bother you when you finally watch them. We walked up and down the platform, had our photo, and filmed the oncoming train as it made the long, slow approach out of 
    the tunnel in the distance. It wasn't a pacer, but it was good enough. We embarked upon this extremely rare Pilning-Glozza train (which the local spotter informed us ran only 
    when Network Rail was kill, like today), and set off.

<ul>
    <li>Ad Glozza</li>
</ul>
<p>
    It was now off to Glozza! We ticked off Yate and Cam & Dursley, which we had missed back on Sampi 5 (yes, we had made it all the way out here on Sampi 5), and then settled in for 
    the long and very slow journey up to Glozza. How this line took what seemed like almost an hour, I do not know. All I know is that we had a nice conversation with the conductor, 
    who was unfortunately unable to sell us any tickets. RIP. For once in our lives, we were unhappy about this. We needed those tickets. We needed to be part of the 21/22 station 
    stats for Pilning! We'd have to find another way... 
    <br><br>
    We pulled into Glozza station, which for some reason looks exactly like a regular station, apart from the single platform marooned half a mile down the track, away from the rest 
    of the station. There is also a single terminating platform, reserved for your friend and mine, TfW, ready to welcome you back into Markey's loving embrace.
    <br><br>
    We headed to the ticket barriers, and explained what had happened (backed up by the conductor himself), and said that our journey was so dumb that the onboard ticket machine 
    refused to sell us our tickets. After a little while, we managed to procure our tickets (albeit a little late for the journey we had meant to use them on), and immediately 
    reversed, away from the ticket barriers, and back over to the other platform. We caught the train 2 stops north, through REDACTED
</p>
<center><video width="40%" controls><source src="../resources/video/TV Error.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>
<p>
    Correction: We did not go to REDACTED. We love Big Brother very much, and he loves us too.
    <br><br>
    We got off at Ashchurch for Tewkesbury, some random station basically in the middle of nowhere. Tewkesbury was about 3 miles away, so whilst we would have gone on a different 
    day, we were very tight for time here. For that reason, we had turned around here, and not continued 1 stop further up the line to Wozza, even though that would have been 
    extremely satisfying. We admired the car park, the allotment, the station sign and the footbridge, and immediately caught the train in the reverse direction, 
    doubling back, <i>not through REDACTED</i>, back to Glozza. Ticking off this 1 station meant that as a result of this adventure, we had now joined together the areas of Sampi, 
    Digamma and Xi for the very first time! Genbatte NT!
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ad Tewkesbury</li>
    <li>Ad Glozza Cathedral and food in spoons</li>
</ul>
<p>
    We returned to Glozza and headed off to explore the town. The town held great promise as an important Roman and mediaeval centre, but was initially very disappointing - just 
    some hole in the middle of some 60s concrete buildings. It wasn't until we got through this bit that it started to improve. There were some nice Tudor buildings and some lovely 
    pubs housed within them. We continued down, through the old Roman Forum (sadly, there were no remains), until we turned down a narrow alleyway and came face-to-face with Gloucester 
    Cathedral. I will admit, if you'd asked me 2 years ago what I thought NT would come to, I would not have said that we'd end up visiting a load of English market towns and cathedral 
    cities, but honestly, I am not complaining. It was beautiful. Easily the best cathedral we have seen during NT. It was a fantastic filming location too. We enjoyed it very much. 
    We saw some Roman street names and Roman roads on the way out of the cathedral, which was also extremely cool.
    <br><br>
    We headed back towards the station, looking for somewhere to eat. After ruling out some pubs, deciding against the fish and chip shop (James still had bad memories of Milford 
    Haven), and failing to find a Pizza Express, we ended up settling on a Spoons. Cheap and cheerful. It was extremely busy, but quite cool - the entire spoons was set up like a theatre, 
    and is apparently used by the local drama students for both their productions and their afterparties! Note to self: go to spoons more often on NT. It is cheap.
</p>
<center><video width="40%" controls><source src="../resources/video/It's cheap.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>
<p>
    We then returned to the station, but not after some random woman came up to us and started eagerly showing us some little creature (I have honestly no idea what animal it was - it 
    has been 4 months - some rodent-y thing, I think) that was living in the bushes. James was ready to burst with laughter, but Matthew for once felt sorry for another human being, and 
    so resisted laughing too.
    <br><br>
    We re-entered the station, checked the dot matrix, and then realised exactly how screwed we were. Those unending delays that had plagued James in Brizzle Parkway earlier? They had 
    now propagated up the line all the way to Glozza. Out of the window went our plans to take the line via Stroud. We just had to get home. When a train showed up, bound for Wales, 
    Matthew implored James to take it, and after computing that Matthew had a ~0% chance of making it home without dying, he hopped on, waved goodbye, and was off without a care in 
    the world!
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ad Glozza Station</li>
    <li>James abandons Matthew abruptly</li>
    <li>I got on this train</li>
    <li>Amazing</li>
    <li>Was quiet</li>
    <li>Sat in first class</li>
    <li>A load of drunk got on without first class tickets</li>
    <li>Made a load of noise and ruccous</li>
    <li>And now one of them has got third degree burns from a coffee</li>
    <li>I'm supposed to be in Swansea in ten minutes and we are currently half way between Cardiff and Bridgend if that.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Admittedly, James had given Matthew a single condition when he hopped on: <strong>'Keep your phone charged, don't die, and let me know when you get home'</strong>. Well, this 
    is never easy for Matthew. Especially not when he had waved James off, knowing fully well that his phone was on 1%. He didn't even make it over the footbridge to his platform 
    before his phone carked it.
    <br><br>
    So Matthew was now in Gloucester, >100 miles from home, on the most fucked day for Network Rail in the year, with no phone, no sleep, in the dark and the cold and the rain, 
    and an uncertain path home... Matthew felt alive - this was fantastic!
    <br><br>
    He ran back and forth through the station along with all the other passengers, as the station announcer gave conflicting information. This included 2 trips to the single 
    marooned platform half a mile away. When he showed up at the train waiting there, the guard said 'Go back to the station, I have no idea what this train here is for, or 
    where it is going, but it ain't going to Brizzle'. After about 20 minutes, Matthew's train did turn up, complete with our Pilning conductor and a group of yobs. Matthew 
    boarded, sat down, closed his eyes, and fell asleep for the entire journey to Brizzle, because Matthew was exhausted, and now he had crashed. RIP.
    <br><br>
    We finally showed up in Brizzle after Matthew had had a snooze, and Matthew went for a wander through Brizzle Parkway. The station opens out into a sea of car parking spaces, 
    and Matthew walked through the entire length of them, before reaching the neighbouring village, doing a single circuit of the village green, and returning to the station, much 
    colder and wetter than before. He then spent the next 30 minutes sitting in the airport-like waiting room, downing the last 2 coffees from lunchtime, and watching the sodium-lit 
    raindrops streak down the windowpanes. Brizzle Parkway was extremely rainy and desolate, and his train was very delayed.
    <br><br>
    Finally, he headed to the platform for the last 20 minutes of waiting, and wandered back and forth, right to the very end of the platform. When the train showed up, Matthew 
    boarded and headed to London, not to leave at all until Aleph 27, and not to leave properly until ∮1dx. Whilst I would tell you more about the remainder of Matthew's journey, 
    I am unable to - Matthew was asleep the whole way home despite the 2 coffees, and probably died or something when he reached London. RIP.
