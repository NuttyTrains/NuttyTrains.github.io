<p>Going to Bristol's most notorious and least used station with two trains a week, all while Bristols train network
    falls to bits around them? Honestly, I cannot think of a better idea!
    <br><br>
    Matthew caught the train to Bristol after not sleeping, and waited for James to arrive. He bought a charger, then saw The Matthew before returning to Temple Meads 
    via Starbucks. James finally showed up, and we walked to Lawrence Hill, caught the train to Clifton Down, and walked underneath the Suspension Bridge. Couldn’t catch 
    the next train so had some lunch and coffee before running back to the station and heading to Severn Beach (missing St Andrews Road). Took a taxi to Pilning and 
    caught the Pilning train to Gloucester, before doubling back at Ashchurch. Saw the cathedral and the Roman road, before having dinner in Spoons. We split at Gloucester 
    station, and Matthew then eventually headed home, via a very rainy and desolate Brizzle Parkway, fuelled by iced coffee.

<ul>
    <li>James arrives at bus stop 15 minutes before his bus, it doesnt turn up</li>
    <li>No busses turn up</li>
    <li>James tries a taxi, none.</li>
    <li>James screams in a lot of pain.</li>
    <li>James wants to off himself.</li>
    <li>James gets on the 0943 to Newport</li>
    <li>James gets stared at by, an admittedly, attractive redhead. James is trying to their number theory problem sheet. 
        He isn't impressed</li>
    <li>James arrives at Newport after screaming at this problem for an hour and a half and tutting repeatedly</li>
    <li>James changes for the Great Malvern train (excuse me, what?)</li>
    <li>James gets off a BPW and dies a little at the amount of people</li>
    <li>They decide to get a bus, and go to the wrong bustop. </li>
    <li>He misses the bus, swear and go and try and get the bus connection by foot.</li>
    <li>He also misses this and ends up ealking by a pond.</li>
    <li>They decide to go back to the station and just get on the train</li>
    <li>Another girl gawks at James, and women are the ones complaining?! Do one, I'm reading my diss book, stop smiling
        sweetly at me foul temptress.
    </li>
    <li>James makes it to meads, meets Matthew, who runs off out of a unknown exit and just starts heading towards LWH</li>
    <li>We overshoot LWH</li>
    <li>Think we have 3 when we have 13 minutes so sprint it</li>
    <li>Get on train, after looking at the edibles.</li>
    <li>Do jumpy on and off to Clifton</li>
    <li>See bridge, after walking past the zoo</li>
    <li>Go down a vertical gorge, and cross a road to realise we can't cross back</li>
    <li>James has heart palpatations and just can't walk</li>
    <li>Miss train, both very angry</li>
    <li>James has food, Matthew has snack. Matthew learns an important lesson, don't drink when you are tired.</li>
    <li>We <s>walk</s> run to Clifton Downs and just about make the train, James' heart just gives up at this point</li>
    <li>Go to Severn Beach</li>
    <li>Taxi to Pilning</li>
    <li>Pilning Time</li>
    <li>Ad Glozza</li>
    <li>Ad Tewkesbury</li>
    <li>Ad Glozza Cathedral and food in spoons</li>
    <li>Ad Glozza Station</li>
    <li>James abandons Matthew abruptly</li>
    <li>I got on this train <br>
        Amazing <br>
        Was quiet <br>
        Sat in first class <br>
        A load of drunk got on without first class tickets <br>
        Made a load of noise and ruccous <br>
        And now one of them has got third degree burns from a coffee <br>
        I'm supposed to be in Swansea in ten minutes and we are currently half way between Cardiff and Bridgend if that.</li>
