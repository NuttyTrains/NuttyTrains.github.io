<p> Going to Bristol's most notorious and least used station with two trains a week, all while Bristols train network
    falls to bits around them? Honestly, I cannot think of a better idea!
    <br><br>
    Let's just start this account with the standard disclaimer that this was not planned well. Not at all. Why we chose this date, I do not know. Neither does James - he 
    had already attempted to do this adventure solo the week before, which would have been a much smarter date to do this. Whilst Digamma 1.9 was mostly a write off, and 
    James failed to reach Pilning, so ended up just going home, that was better than what we faced on Digamma 2: the entire rail network in Brizzle being a complete write-off. 
    This was going to be fun!
    <br><br>
    As seems to be a tradition for adventures where Matthew has to travel across the country, Matthew had failed to sleep the night before, so was going to try and conduct 
    this adventure fuelled entirely by iced coffee. He caught the train from Paddington and headed to Brizzle on the gay train (800008: everyone's favourite!). A completely 
    uneventful, on-time journey. If only the same could be same for James... 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>James arrives at bus stop 15 minutes before his bus, it doesnt turn up</li>
    <li>No busses turn up</li>
    <li>James tries a taxi, none.</li>
    <li>James screams in a lot of pain.</li>
    <li>James wants to off himself.</li>
    <li>James gets on the 0943 to Newport</li>
    <li>James gets stared at by, an admittedly, attractive redhead. James is trying to do their number theory problem sheet. 
        He isn't impressed</li>
</ul>

    So Matthew arrived in Brizzle and then had to wait for the next >2 hours for James to arrive. James' phone was almost as dead as Matthew was, so James requested that 
    Matthew pick him up a charger. Thus, Matthew's first course of action was to head south from Temple Meads, cross the river, and head toward Bedminster. Once this 
    task was complete, he crossed back across the Avon, and headed towards the old docks. Here, he stopped off at what had been secretly planned to be our first stop: 
    a ship called The Matthew. This ship was sailed by John Cabot across the Atlantic when he discovered Newfoundland in 1497. Matthew said this all on camera for a video 
    segment, but James may or may not be interested in 'accurate' information. Matthew also saw a sign including Stephen the seagull, which seemed very appropriate for NT.
    <br><br>
    Matthew then started to return to Temple Meads, via the outskirts of the city centre, and via Castle Park. He walked alongside the river and along the side of the huge 
    road leading back to the station. Just as he was about to reach Temple Meads, he came across possibly the most traumatising sight he has ever seen... 
    <br><br>
    <strong>A seagull eating a Meal Deal</strong>
    <br><br>
    It was awful. Terrible. Revolting. The seagulls dragged Meal Deal's poor and sorry carcass around, ripping chunks off and almost severing its head... all on camera for 
    our valued viewers! It traumatised Matthew to film, and traumatised James to edit, so now it can traumatise you as you watch it. Enjoy!

<p>
    After this horrific experience, Matthew called James only to find that James was <i>still</i> nowhere near arriving, so Matthew headed into the closest Starbucks, not for 
    coffee (surprisingly), but to use the bathroom. He stood outside the door for a full 20 minutes, as the bathroom remained occupied, until a lady customer came to also use 
    the bathroom, and taught Matthew the trick of just using a 2p coin to forcefully unlock the door from the outside, which was genius. Soon after this, Matthew returned to 
    the ticket hall in Temple Meads, and awaited James' arrival. What was James getting up to in the meantime?
</p>
<ul>
    <li>James arrives at Newport after screaming at this problem for an hour and a half and tutting repeatedly</li>
    <li>James changes for the Great Malvern train (excuse me, what?)</li>
    <li>James gets off at BPW and dies a little at the amount of people</li>
    <li>They decide to get a bus, and go to the wrong bustop. </li>
    <li>He misses the bus, swears and goes and tries to get the bus connection by foot.</li>
    <li>He also misses this and ends up walking by a pond.</li>
    <li>They decide to go back to the station and just get on the train</li>
    <li>Another girl gawks at James, and women are the ones complaining?! Do one, I'm reading my diss book, stop smiling
        sweetly at me foul temptress.
    </li>
    <li>James makes it to Temple Meads, meets Matthew, who runs off out of an unknown exit and just starts heading towards LWH</li>
</ul>
<p>
    James finally showed up, and we walked to Lawrence Hill, caught the train to Clifton Down, and walked underneath the Suspension Bridge. Couldn’t catch 
    the next train so had some lunch and coffee before running back to the station and heading to Severn Beach (missing St Andrews Road). Took a taxi to Pilning and 
    caught the Pilning train to Gloucester, before doubling back at Ashchurch. Saw the cathedral and the Roman road, before having dinner in Spoons. We split at Gloucester 
    station, and Matthew then eventually headed home, via a very rainy and desolate Brizzle Parkway, fuelled by iced coffee.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>We overshoot LWH</li>
    <li>Think we have 3 when we have 13 minutes so sprint it</li>
    <li>Get on train, after looking at the edibles.</li>
    <li>Do jumpy on and off to Clifton</li>
    <li>See bridge, after walking past the zoo</li>
    <li>Go down a vertical gorge, and cross a road to realise we can't cross back</li>
    <li>James has heart palpatations and just can't walk</li>
    <li>Miss train, both very angry</li>
    <li>James has food, Matthew has snack. Matthew learns an important lesson, don't drink when you are tired.</li>
    <li>We <s>walk</s> run to Clifton Downs and just about make the train, James' heart just gives up at this point</li>
    <li>Go to Severn Beach</li>
    <li>Taxi to Pilning</li>
    <li>Pilning Time</li>
    <li>Ad Glozza</li>
    <li>Ad Tewkesbury</li>
    <li>Ad Glozza Cathedral and food in spoons</li>
    <li>Ad Glozza Station</li>
    <li>James abandons Matthew abruptly</li>
    <li>I got on this train <br>
        Amazing <br>
        Was quiet <br>
        Sat in first class <br>
        A load of drunk got on without first class tickets <br>
        Made a load of noise and ruccous <br>
        And now one of them has got third degree burns from a coffee <br>
        I'm supposed to be in Swansea in ten minutes and we are currently half way between Cardiff and Bridgend if that.</li>
