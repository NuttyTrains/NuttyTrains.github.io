<p> Matthew and his friend Ewan went to the fabled station of <strong>Nantgarw</strong> for a MAT session, but on the way, Matthew made the fatal 
error of jumping on the first valley train he saw... without checking the destination. Hmm. This sounds familiar...
<br><br>
In early July 2018, Matthew had been invited to what was allegedly a joint MAT/PAT session, organised by SEREN in Coleg Y Cymoedd, 
in <s>Treforest</s> Nantgarw, which had involved him getting on the most packed commuter train he'd ever been on outside London, 
changing to the Valley lines for the very first time and heading north, before alighting at Nantgarw and walking a mile down the 
road to the college. 
<br><br>
Nantgarw is an exceptionally weird station. It consists of a single island platform between the 2 tracks, with a central 
staircase leading down through the platform and along a subway to the ground level below. Passengers must then walk along a dirt 
track through an old industrial area for a while, before finally reaching the dual carriageway through the business estate that 
the college is located at the south end of. After the session, Matthew decided to walk slightly further to the other station, Taff's Well, 
due to its higher frequency service on the way back.
<br><br>
Ewan had also been invited to the session (which turned out to be a guinea pig session for future MAT sessions), 
but decided not to come... and neither did most of Wales. The entire session had less than 10 people there, yet still went very 
slowly. Despite this, the decision was made to run another in September 2018, which is where this adventure begins.
<br><br>
Early that morning, at about 7am, Matthew and Ewan headed to Neath railway station to catch the train to Cardiff (Matthew was on 
time for once). Even back in September 2018, before the official start of NT, Ewan was fully aware that Matthew doesn't make the 
best travelling companion, especially on trains, due to his inability to be anywhere on time, and his colourful history of random 
adventures on the trains. Matthew, for his part, insisted that he had planned everything to a tee, and that nothing could possibly 
go wrong.
<br><br> 
As the train approached Cardiff, everything was running smoothly for once. How strange! Everything was running so smoothly 
in fact, that there was the possibility of catching an earlier train to Nantgarw (which ran once an hour), as opposed to the one 
that Matthew had planned to catch. According to the timetables, there would be a 3-minute connection, but that seemed like nothing 
after the previous adventure - it would be fine!
<br><br>
And then things stopped going smoothly. The platform at the station was occupied, so the train ground to a halt just before the station. 
We were now losing crucial time, and this was an issue. Our 3 minute connection was rapidly becoming a 2 minute connection, and by the 
time the doors opened, we had just one minute. Once again, Matthew employed the "fucking leg it!" solution, and Ewan struggled to 
keep up as Matthew threw himself down the flight of stairs, sprinted along the corridor, and flew up the stairs to the departure 
platform.
<br><br>
When he arrived, there was a pacer stopped directly in front of the stairs on the correct platform. Correct platform? Correct time? 
Correct crappiness of the train? This must be our valley line train! Matthew ran on, with Ewan just behind, and we sat down, 
having triumphantly made our connection. The train pulled out of the station, and headed up the track through Queen Street. Matthew 
was now fully confident that he would be making a triumphant and leisurely return to Nantgarw.
<br><br>
However, along the way, a few things seemed off. Firstly, Matthew never noticed the train passing through Cathays or Radyr stations, 
which he knew the line stopped at. Hmm. Weird. 'Perhaps I just didn't notice them' he thought.
<br><br>
Secondly, the train started to stop at some stations Matthew hadn't seen before, like Birchgrove. This wasn't even out of the corner 
of his eye either; Ewan explicitly mentioned it and had a 10 minute conversation about Birchgrove station! 'Perhaps I didn't notice 
Birchgrove last time', Matthew thought.
<br><br>
Thirdly, after about half an hour, we were still pulling through suburban Cardiff. This surely couldn't be right. Matthew quickly 
thought of an excuse, 'Perhaps... I just didn't notice the time in the summer?'.
<br><br>
Ewan started to check where the train was on Snap Maps. The map clearly showed that the train was deep in eastern Cardiff, far away 
from the line to Nantgarw. "The map lies!" said Matthew. "Snap maps is always wrong anyway".
<br><br>
That was all settled then.<br>
Everything was fine.</p>
<center><p><strong>And then the train started reversing</strong></p></center>
<p>Matthew had managed to catch the wrong train, and we were now half an hour away from the city centre, on some godforsaken pacer 
in suburban Cardiff. It was time to dial Matthew's stress-o-metre up to 11, where it usually sits.
<br><br>
Consulting his trustworthy timetable, whilst Ewan checked on his phone, we came to the conclusion that not only had we missed the 
early train to Nantgarw (obviously), but we had also missed our planned train to Nantgarw, which was the last to actually stop at 
Nantgarw in time.
<br><br>
Once Ewan had calmed Matthew out of panic mode, we decided that the best course of action was to get off the city line pacer at 
Queen Street, change to the Aberdare train, and get off at Taff's Well, 2 miles away from Nantgarw, with half an hour to spare. 
And duly, we did that. Matthew did, admittedly, run up a flight of stairs in panic, but otherwise things were okay. The Aberdare 
train announcement at Queen Street explicitly stated that there was no alcohol permitted on this early morning train. Welcome to 
the Valleys!
<br><br>
This time, Matthew recognised the stations on the route, Cardiff came to an end after 10 minutes, and Snap Maps revealed that we 
were going the right direction this time. We arrived in Taff's Well, and alighted.
<br><br>
For the next 2 miles, we powerwalked/jogged/sprinted, depending on how stressed Matthew was, and how knackered Ewan was at the 
time. Fortunately, we arrived with time to spare. When we reached the car park and came to cross each road, we managed the amazing 
magic trick of thanking the cars in unison. Absolutely magic.
<br><br>
We arrived in Coleg Y Cymoedd and Matthew immediately recognised the man taking the session. We went up, and said we were from 
Neath College and were here for the MAT session.
<br><br>
<i>"Neath College? What are you doing here? You must have had a long journey! Didn't anyone tell you that I am doing the exact same 
session tomorrow in Swansea? You didn't need to come all the way out here!"</i>
<br><br>
...
<br><br>
Yes. Someone told us that there would be a session on our doorstep, but we decided to come here instead.<br>
Of course no-one told us!
<br><br>
Rant over. The MAT session was good, I guess.
<br><br>
The real highlight of the day was actually exploring Coleg Y Cymoedd. It was absolutely huge! It could have swallowed up B Block 4 
times, and it was only 1 of 4 campuses of equal size for the college! Not only that, but the entire interior of the block was filled 
with an absolutely enormous atrium, 3 or 4 floors high, with a succession of flying staircases and walkways stretching up all the way. 
There were numerous classrooms with glass walls, and they had real carpet and fresh paint too! We didn't know what to make of it!
<br><br>
Ewan spent much of the day reporting back home about how lucky the other half had it. Sure, they had a McDonalds, KFC and Nandos 
around the corner, but that didn't come close to comparing to one of the 7 Wonders of Nantgarw: <strong>a functioning water fountain!
</strong>We couldn't believe our eyes! What was this magical thing, water pressure? Is this what water fountains were meant to do? 
This was a shocking discovery, but things only became more shocking.
<br><br>
We headed downstairs, to find that instead of a Brook-like canteen serving green eggs and ham, they had a full restaurant! A full, 
waited restaurant, complete with fancy crockery, cutlery and tablecloths, serving actual food, without the poisoning! Even more, 
you had to book a reservation, which was apparently very popular. What was this world we had stepped into?
<br><br>
We decided to head up to the kitchen to investigate. We stood by the kitchen door, and peered in, faces pressed against the glass. 
Then, one of the kitchen staff came up behind us and asked us what we were doing. Before we could reply sheepishly, she asked 
"would you like to come in and have a look?". And so, in this way, we had a tour of Coleg Y Cymoedd's kitchens, which was more than 
their actual students had had. By the time we left that afternoon, Nantgarw was legendary, and we were legends too.
<br><br>
We leisurely returned to Taff's Well on the way back, and the journey home was rather uneventful. Fear not though, for there is one 
final section to this adventure. When we recounted our tale in college the next day, it transpired that our chemistry teacher had 
also recently been to Nantgarw, and some of our medicine friends would also be heading there shortly after us for a BMAT course. 
Nantgarw, quite rightfully, was the centre of the universe, but only we had been given a tour of the kitchens there! 
<br><br>
(As a side note, Ewan would bully Matthew about him getting on the wrong train for months afterwards in physics lessons)
