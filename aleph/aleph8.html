<p> Matthew and Ewan then went on a trip to the University of Bath open day. Our journey involved a rail replacement bus journey, 
a surprise visit to Patchway, and Matthew spilling his lunch/burning hot tea down himself. Just a normal day then, really!
<br><br>
One Wednesday in October, Matthew and Ewan didn't turn up to college in the morning (thereby missing maths), but instead went to 
Neath train station to catch a train to Bath, for the Bath University open day. Missing maths wasn't a problem for Ewan, who was 
ahead of the course and on good attendance, but perhaps wasn't so good for Matthew, who despite also being ahead, hadn't turned up 
to a maths lesson in about 3 weeks, and was on about 40% attendance. Yikes.
<br><br>
We caught a GWR train to Bristol Parkway, which stopped briefly enough in Cardiff to avoid triggering Matthew's PTSD from the last 
adventure. At Bristol Parkway we alighted. ... Unfortunately, we now encountered a problem. The lines around Bristol were closed. 
At the time, there were extensive modernisation works taking place on all the Bristol lines, and we'd managed to arrive slap bang 
in the middle of them. This meant only one thing. Oh, the horror! A r...r...rail replacement bus!
<br><br>
We walked out of Bristol Parkway station (which is horrifcally ugly and in the middle of nowhere), to find our bus awaiting us.
It was a First bus, so that was familiar, despite not being reassuring. Admittedly, the double decker bus was from a completely 
different part of the country, but sometimes busses get lost, right?
<br><br>
The bus took well over half an hour to trundle down the M32 towards the city centre, and it finally dumped us in Temple Meads, 
ready for us to catch our Bath-bound train. I don't remember running on this occasion, but I have sprinted to catch countless trains 
at TM, so I may be mistaken. Either way, we were only on the train for a single stop before we alighted and entered Bath.
<br><br>
We walked into the city centre, and stood in front of the cathedral. Unless I am mistaken, we wandered for a bit along the streets 
of shops, saw an old market, and Palace Gardens. Matthew also bought a postcard for Freya in the souvenir shop outside the Roman 
Baths/the Cathedral. We then caught the unibus up to the university. It was on this bus journey that 
Matthew told Ewan he was no longer single, to Ewan's great dismay.
<br><br>
I then think we headed straight to the Dyson building, and went downstairs to the exhibition of past students' projects. We even saw your 
brother's poster (I hope you mentioned that to him). We talked to some current students, one running a Pascal's triangle-type game, 
one with a pile of Jenga blocks you could stack to create an overhang, and they also mentioned the (non-)convergence of a harmonic 
series. Whilst we were doing that, <strong>Prince Edward</strong> turned up for some reason?! We tried to stay in the corner so as 
not to invite attention to ourselves. Later on, Geoff Smith arrived, and we had a long chat to him about UKMT and the BMO, as we'd 
both recently had Golds in the Senior UKMT Challenge.
<br><br>
We were then invited into the room to have lunch. This is where things went wrong for Matthew.
<br><br>
Ewan, like a normal human being, managed to correctly load his plate and get a drink, before sitting down. Good job. Matthew, on the 
other hand, can barely pretend to be a normal human being, so this was not possible. His plate was imbalanced so slipped and bent in 
half. He then quickly moved his other hand to try and stop the slide. This would have worked, had his other hand not been holding a 
cup of boiling tea. He managed to splash some boiling tea on himself, which hurt, so he flinched violently, thereby not only spilling 
large quantities of tea over his body (which really hurt), but managing to drop his entire lunch on the floor. <strong>Everything. 
</strong> A kind student took pity on him, helped him clean it up, and when he was too embarassed to try again, actually got Matthew 
lunch. That was really kind, but only made him even more embarassed.
<br><br>
After a brief talk in the room, which may or may not have been brief, and may or may not have included bits of maths, 
we were taken to a large lecture hall, to hear a talk from Geoff (James, pay attention to this bit - 
<strong>Geoff Smith!!</strong>). He talked about the uni and the department and the course. It was quite a funny talk. ... (That's pretty much it. 
You can stop paying attention now). Oh, actually, I lie. He mentioned his work with UKMT, the BMO and the IMO, including IMO2019 (If 
you stopped paying attention, you missed out there). 
<br><br>
We then went on a tour of the university. It is at this point that I must apologise. I remember very little about the following 
order of events, and some of the events I remember are warped, distorted or just plain false. Think of this as a case study for your 
Netflix memory documentary rather than a "factual" NT account!
<br><br>
We saw the pond (and amphitheatre), the library, the union, the quads (cue spitting from Ewan) and some sort of theatre-y building. 
We also saw the extensive sporting facilities, an exam hall and the Chancellor's Building, but not necessarily in that order.
<br><br>
Following that, your guess is as good as mine. I have absolutely no idea what we did next, if anything at all. It is possible that 
the tour ended at that was that. It is possible that we did some maths. We may have done maths before then, which I have forgotten. 
I genuinely have no idea.
<br><br>
What I do know is that Matthew wrote Freya the postcard he'd bought earlier and posted it in the university post office. It was now 
growing dark, so we caught the unibus to the city, then got on a train to Bristol. This was a commuter train, so it stopped at all 
the little stops between the 2 cities. It was also around rushhour, so it was quite busy. 
<br><br>
We pulled into Bristol TM and exited, 
heading outside to the bus. It took us ages to get on the bus, and took ages for the bus to leave, but it took almost an hour for 
the bus to fight its way up the M32. Strangely, we were dumped not in Bristol Parkway, but in Patchway, a far lesser used station 
to the west. How bizzare. At some point on our journey home, we messaged and called our maths teacher Gareth, who had just recieved 
our UKMT scores. For once, the text messages were actually friendly and not at all threatening! That was even more bizarre. 
Finally, we caught the train home to Neath. We had a missed maths lesson to not catch up on.
