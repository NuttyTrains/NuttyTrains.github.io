  After many months of waiting, it was finally time for a hash! Getting on a packed train, meeting up with a load of old codgers and cramming into a busy pub, 
  all on the first day of lockdown reopening? Possibility of getting chocked: 0 <br><br>

  I can't promise length, but I can however promise that I have no sanity and life is 10000% better without it. This story took place last Monday at the time of
  writing and probably has aged like a fine bloody wine. It has floral notes of complexity, a sweetness that only time and give it and a slightly odd taste at the
  back of the mouth, or that may have just been my lunch. So join me and let's relive a time where I got so pissed I passed out in a field. <br>
  So this hash began as all good hashes should, getting on a train to head into the deepest darkest depths of Cornwall. I had literally just turned up at Camborne
  train station and <strong>ding</strong>, my phone told me I was off to the Boslowick Inn, Falmouth. For those of you less in the know about the pubs of Kernow, shame 
  on you! You should know better by now. However, the Bosee is a lovely old pub on the outskirts of Truro. It is of Tudor build and a sight to see, the inside has changed 
  very little from when it was built back when most of the hashers were having their midlife crisis'. However, that was not the major problem of this pub. The problem lay
  in it's location. You see the far side of Falmouth is not a good side of Falmouth and so the Bosee is placed in a lovely, juicy, tasty, burny, stabby, unfriendly council
  estate. We were only running from there, so what could go wrong? <br>
  So back to me on the train, by this time my thoughts had passed and I was nearly at Truro. The Cornish railway network is a funny beast and has a main spine and several
  spirs coming off it, branch lines. It's an interesting setup and annoying at best. So, I got off at Truro and crossed the platform and was over at the Falmouth platform.
  The platform was quiet and it was 10 minutes to the train so I went to go and relieve myself and then came back. When I came back however, all the seats were taken, not a 
  problem it was only a few minutes so I stood and waited for the train. I saw an 800 pull in behind me, nice, I didn't know they were back in service just yet, so I took a 
  picture for Matthew and I'll let past James describe that happened next,<br></p>

  <p>  <strong>JamesA</strong> - 800 in operation, and off it fell mountains of emmets. <br>
    <strong>JamesA</strong> - This is the busiest train I've been on since... god knows <br></p>

    <strong>Matthew</strong> — XD <br>
    <strong>JamesA</strong> — I think the students are least of my issues <br>
    <strong>Matthew</strong> — Everyone's off down the pub, aren't they? xD
    <strong>JamesA</strong> — ... <br>
    Fuck me <br>
    This is going to be... fun <br>
    <strong>Matthew</strong> — Yep <br>
    <strong>JamesA</strong> — I think the train has fucked itself <br>
  </p> <br>
  <p>
    Little does Matthew know, this was the best of it, the train emptied the whole population of London, Reading and any other bloody stop of the line onto that platform and
    just as the last people rolled off the 800 and it ran on it's way the little plucky cattle truck appeared around the corner, veering its head at the mass of people stood 
    waiting to crush it onto the rails. It trundled along slowly doing it's usual decaying exponential stop. At which point it refused to open it's doors and we stood on the 
    platform jostling to get on first. Social Distancing? What is that? I've never heard of that in my life. To no avail the poor old rail staff shouted to try and get people 
    to put on a face covering and to stand apart. IT was no use, at this point the mass of people has shoved me straight onto the closed doors, I was at a nice 5 degree angle 
    between where my toes were pointing and the angle of my back. It was at this point, the British Transport Police came over, <br>
    <strong>BTP</strong> - Oi! What 'ave we got goin' on 'ere then? <br>
    <strong>Station Manager</strong> - They aren't listening <br>
    <strong>BTP</strong> - Well, you know what we do then, get the stick. <br>
    It was at this point, the BTP started giving out fines to the holiday makers for not wearing masks and not socially distancing. They were nice, juicy and hefty, show those 
    bleddy emmets. The BTP, then escorted us onto the train, making sure only the allowed and alloted number were on the train. This, however still left the train uncomfortably 
    busy as I took a seat and an old codger decided it was decorum in the current times to sit next to me?! If they were a hasher, fair enough, but no it was a random old codger 
    from Up North. He was down on holiday with his massive case and 'ack his train ticket printed on a sheet of paper. That's the real sign of an old emmet, a polly pocket with: 
    a train ticket, hotel information and adress, a map of the local area and whatever shit they decide to chuck in there for fun. To make things worse, the pollypocket is also 
    always dirty. Anyways, we arrived at Penmere and some sweet sweet karma was dished up as the codger gets off the train, nearly falls over and then asks me if this is Falmouth 
    Town, this was as the train pulls off. This was <strong>not</strong> Falmouth Town, this was Penmere. So, as any self respecting local says, 'No, this is Penmere, Falmouth 
    Town' is a stop down the line. (Note for Matthew: FMT is 3 minutes down the road to walk at Codger pace) and at that, I walked off. The Bosee was a ten minute walk down the 
    road and was through the council estate, but it wasn't that bad, I was early. ON ON was at 1845 for 1900 and it was 1810 now. <br>
