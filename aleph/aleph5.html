<p> James successfully gained an interview with Big Blue. This meant he now had to successfully navigate London and Cambridge...
<br><br>
So James had a interview in London for IBM, this meant that he had to go to London, join him on his way through the tube, the second time ever and first on my 
own. Then to the splendeur of Tab. Getting lost shanked and then to top me off, getting to go home via Waterloo.
<br><br>
So this was a fun one. This is the one where we talk about the Night Riviera and more of a NT adventure than all the rest. He didn't sleep all night, but that is only 
the beginning of the grizzly and fun details!
<br><br>
Unfortunately, more than 3 years later, James doesn't have the faintest fucking idea about what happened on this trip, other than the fact that he loves BB very much.
<br><br>
So for this reason, I found a crappy online story generator and let <i>it</i> write this account (which I then <i>slightly modified</i>)! Enjoy!

<strong><b>Tube and Tab: what maybe happened</b></strong>
<br><br>
James looked at the Big Blue teapot in his hands and felt scared shitless.
<br><br>
He walked over to the window and reflected on his magnificent surroundings. He had always loved grey London with its sour, choking smog. It was a place that encouraged 
his tendency to feel unable to breathe.
<br><br>
Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Big Brother. Big Brother was a confident God with dark hair, spiky, ample hands and 
moist fingers.
<br><br>
James gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a stingy, miserly, insane, violent whiskey drinker with auburn hair and moist hands. His friends saw him as a 
security risk. Once, he had even helped push a prole off a cliff.
<br><br>
But not even a miserly person who had once helped push a prole off a cliff, was prepared for what Big Brother had in store today.
<br><br>
The rain hammered like sprinting seagulls and the smog teased like singing pigeons, making James drunk.
<br><br>
As James stepped outside and Big Brother came closer, he could see the damp glint in his eye and the resonant smile on his face.
<br><br>
"I am here because I want death to the proles," Big Brother bellowed, in an unstable tone. He slammed his fist against James's chest, with the force of 5491 inhabitants 
of Townhill. "I hate the proles, James Arthur. Big Brother loves you, James Arthur."
<br><br>
James looked back, even more drunk and still fingering the Big Blue teapot. "BB, BB, BB, I love BB," he replied.
<br><br>
They looked at each other with amazed feelings, like two ratty, rough rats getting shanked at a very clueless interview, which had Boriswave music playing in the 
background and two unstable LEAN bots screaming drunkenly.
<br><br>
James regarded Big Brother's dark hair and spiky hands. He held out his hand. "I love Big Brother." he whispered, gently.
<br><br>
"Maybe I shall send you to Room V." pondered Big Brother.
<br><br>
"I love Big Brother!" begged James with puppy dog eyes.
<br><br>
Big Brother looked amused, his body shaking like a homeless cw√¢c addict.
<br><br>
Then Big Brother came inside for a nice drink of alcohol.
