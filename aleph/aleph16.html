Aleph 16 - Chocktastic Processes in Bury Port
<br><br>
It's been a while since I've written one of these and a while since James has been on an Aleph adventure. In the absence of an R_0, James decided to go on an adventure of 
his own. However, he wasn't just going to run round following a certain level of insanity, he was going to document a few things in Burry Port while he was there. He had a 
few areas of attack: 1) The Amelia Earhart Memorial and 2) A coastal film location. He also had an alibi, if anybody questioned him. He was a videographer for the BBC, 
well… thats not entirely false (SHAMELESS PLUG TO MY RADIO PIECE). I'm getting ahead of myself.
<br><br>
So James left home and got on the 1000 bus down to Gowerton, this went seamlessly. He arrived at Gowerton, yes he had to run down the hill to get to the station, but he 
was early so he stood at his usual spot on the platform and waited. And waited. And waited. Fucking hell its been twenty minutes. Where on the fuck are this train? TfW 
had done it this time! They were nearly 30 minutes late! James turned around and checked the dot matrix, the next train was in an hour. Where was his train? He then went
and checked his trusty friend, RealTime Trains (TM), the train went past gowerton alright, and even stopped. It stopped? When? Oh, eight minutes early. Surely it waited? 
Oh it left five minutes early. 
<br><br>
Now, you have to understand something about James. Usually he leaves ten minutes for every connection he makes. Usually. Not in Swansea. He leaves 30 seconds to do a two 
minute walk. This usually has meant at every R_0 adventure James sprinted from  bus to the train. Luckily, every time he made it. However he didn't this time. It may also 
be due to the fact James usually gets the 0930 bus, or something like that. He can't remember. Who needs connection time when your bus is every half an hour? That is such 
a luxury. I expect Matthew to chime in at this point and tell me how the Central line is every 0.0001 seconds and if it's even 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
000000000000000000…. and so on …0000000000000000000000000000000000… and a bit more ...000000000000000000000000000… just a tad more ….01 nanoseconds late he will walk to the
next station. Bleddy Londoner he is. In good old Kernow you praise the lord if your train is every hour and some old dear hasn't hijacked it and is now taking it shopping 
where there aren't any tracks. 
<br><br>
So James had missed the train, to quote myself at this exact moment “&?@*& TfW what a load of #$&*#$ *&#*$#*# *&$#%&$!”. James can create some rather colourful language 
when James misses a train. James paced up and down the platforms like a demented fossa to let off some pent up steam. Now James didn't know what to do and James had 
forgotten to take a bottle of water with him so James went to the ‘Top’ shop in Gowerton. The ‘Top’ shop is Gowerton's premier provider of gone off and mouldy produce. 
If it ain't mouldy you get your money back guaranteed. So as any self respecting person would James bought some of the <s>mans</s>, no sorry James can't say that anymore, 
featherless bipeds, yes that's better, finest wares. James bought a bottle of water and some crisps that went off… four years ago. James went back to the station and 
started writing the script for his video, he decided that it would be the best idea to have one. The hour passed quite quickly, while swearing and listening to his 
favourite music. While sitting there, he learnt two things, well one of them was a reaffirmation: 1) Lots of trains don't stop at Gowerton and 2) BIRO PENS ARE A THING 
OF HELL AND DESERVE TO BURN. 
<br><br>
Finally, after what seemed like an eternity the train arrived. (This writeup is going to be a long one so buckle up!) James jumped on the train, with all his equptment 
and sat at a table while finishing his script. I should note that James looked very nefarious, more than normal. He had a bag laden with audio equipment and a tripod also
on his back. He also had a pair of headphone around his neck, wireless. It was definitely eye catching. James happened to sit next to a group of girls who thought his
whole setup was rather interesting and they spent the first part of the train trip giggling and watching him feverishly finishing his script while he periodically looked 
up and smiled at them. As he finished the script one of the girls, the one closest to him and most likely to give him chock, asked him what the bloody hell he was doing. 
James faultered for a minute, not actually thinking he'd have to use his alibi. He proclaimed his alibi and they seemed interested. He said he did a lot of stuff with the 
radio and this was just a few bits for BBC Four, nobody watches BBC Four he thought. He was correct as they had never heard of BBC Four. If not for anything else he gained
four more Twitter followers out of the interaction. The girls also told him where the memorial was and he was on his way.
<br><br>
James is also an actor, you must remember, and now he had a role to play. He was a BBC videographer. He was important and people were not to disturb his filming hence the 
wrath of the BBC. So he played it. He started walking around purposely. Burry Port had not seen the likes of this and many old ladies stopped and stared at the sight of Mr
Important BBC Videographer. James went up into the depth of Burry Port. He found his film spot. He felt slightly more comfortable as the police station was just off stage
left in his shot. So if things went pear shaped and he got shanked he was safe. </p>

<center><quote>(This was just a photo from after, it wasn't an actual shot. However you can see all the equipment set up)</quote></center>

<p>
As he was setting up in the War Memorial park he was getting stares from more old people and the local labourers were interested with what Mr Important BBC Man was doing 
in their little hamlet on the sea. James did consider doing the whole thing on the road but that would be very disruptive to everybody and probably the cars, these weren't 
the MathSoc awards night videos. He did two actual runs of filming and he is planning to chuck it out on this youtube channel some time in the next couple of weeks.
<br><br>
To anybody that has never been to Burry Port it is basically a blood clot around the railway line, or like a soldier blob on a wire. You get the picture. It has the 
Northern Part, where the first video was filmed and the southern part, where we find James now. He is just wandering about deciding where to go for his second filming 
and more importantly lunch. He deciding after wandering in the complete and utter wrong direction, to go for Pembrey Harbour. He set off along the South Wales coastal path.
The persona stayed with him as people along the path kept their distance by flinging themselves out of his way. He was god. After walking for approximately 30 minutes of 
walking, James was hungry, he reached an amicable spot for filming and lunch eating. So he found a grassy verge and had his lunch. A couple of people passed him and 
questioned his place of luncheon, however they didn't disturb him. As he was finishing off his lunch an old couple came along and said to him “"Who needs Spain?”, as with 
any normal person he replied “Not me!”. #FuckSpain. He had set up his equipment before somebody else passed him and asked about his set up and whether he was filming. 
Again the ever diligent actor, he told them about what he was doing for the BBC. However James this time thought of something funny and added, “Oh, don’t you worry I’m not 
a porn director”. To which the man laughed in hysterics, James thought he’d have a heart attack be he carried on walking and James was alone again.
<br><br>
He went back to the station and decided not to go back home. It was adventure time. James went to Ferryside. When he arrived he witnessed <s>plebs</s> good citizens of 
wales, <s> a shack </s> the village shop and <s> some wasteland </s> the local car park. It was a truly amazing and beautiful place. I promise that this is coming from a 
place of good will towards <s> the welsh language society </s> the people of Ferryside. I shall leave this adventure here.
