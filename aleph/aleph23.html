  Matthew descends on Battersea Power Station Station Station to meet the Imperial RailSoc, and ride the first ever train down the Northern Line extension at 05:28 
  in the morning, and meets Geoff along the way, as well as bumping into Hugo, Jago, TubeMapper, LU News and many many more! James was very jealous.

  This story actually begins this previous day, as Matthew decided it would be a good idea to not sleep that night :)

  At approximately 4am, Matthew set off on his bike, cycling through Holland Park on his way to Imperial, where he left his bike, before walking/jogging towards 
  Battersea. To absolutely no-one's surprise, he was late once again, as the Imperial RailSoc had wanted to meet at 05:10. By 05:08, he was on Chelsea Bridge, and so 
  decided to attempt to take a shortcut along the river, and through the new development. This turned out to be a huge mistake, as every street turned out to be 
  a dead-end. RIP. Fortunately for Matthew, a jogger was passing at the same time, also getting lost down dead ends, and so we decided to follow one another and head in the 
  same direction, even though neither of us knew where we were going, and only implicitly assumed that the other was also headed to the new station, which in hindsight 
  is hilarious. We jogged for an entire mile, down side streets and across roundabouts, and eventually both arrived at the station, to be greeted by none other than 
  Geoff himself, who was filming the start of his video right in front of Matthew. This was going to be an excellent morning!
