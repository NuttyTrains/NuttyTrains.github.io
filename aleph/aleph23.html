  Matthew descends on Battersea Power Station Station Station to meet the Imperial RailSoc, and ride the first ever train down the Northern Line extension at 05:28 
  in the morning, and meets Geoff along the way, as well as bumping into Hugo, Jago, TubeMapper, LU News and many many more! James was very jealous.
  <br><br>
  This story actually begins this previous day, as Matthew decided it would be a good idea to not sleep that night :)
  <br><br>
  At approximately 4am, Matthew set off on his bike, cycling through Holland Park on his way to Imperial, where he left his bike, before walking/jogging towards 
  Battersea. To absolutely no-one's surprise, he was late once again, as the Imperial RailSoc had wanted to meet at 05:10. By 05:08, he was on Chelsea Bridge, and so 
  decided to attempt to take a shortcut along the river, and through the new development. This turned out to be a huge mistake, as every street turned out to be 
  a dead-end. RIP. Fortunately for Matthew, a jogger was passing at the same time, also getting lost down dead ends, and so we decided to follow one another and head in the 
  same direction, even though neither of us knew where we were going, and only implicitly assumed that the other was also headed to the new station, which in hindsight 
  is hilarious. We jogged for an entire mile, down side streets and across roundabouts, and eventually both arrived at the station, to be greeted by none other than 
  Geoff himself, who was filming the start of his video right in front of Matthew. This was going to be an excellent morning!
  <br><br>
  Matthew stood awkwardly at the perimeter of the crowd for a while, trying to find the RailSoc, but to no avail. What he did notice though, was that this 150-strong 
  crowd was filled with other train nuts - basically everyone was wearing a tube mask or tube t-shirt, and there were cameras to film the event everywhere! Matthew brought 
  out his trusty, high quality phone camera, and started filming too, because our Youtube subscribers need <strong><i>content<sup>TM</sup></i></strong>!
  <br><br>
  At about 05:15, the doors opened, and everyone poured through the doors, with Geoff and Jago towards the front. As befitting a ceremonial grand opening, the escalator decided 
  to die after exactly 30 seconds in service, and so we walked down instead. Well done TfL, well done. Matthew stood towards the back of the queue, and walked down the escalator 
  into the large ticket hall, passing through the ticket barriers and passing Geoff and Jago on his way to the platforms. The platforms were done up nicely too, with polished metal 
  and concrete - it was very smart actually. It was a bit like the MTR. Seeing a the under-train section of the rails actually being clean was really disconcerting though, but it 
  was awesome to spot the new maps, roundels and in-carriage diagrams everywhere.
  <br><br>
  Everyone crowded around Geoff for a while, as he filmed his segment in the station, before the train doors beeped, we all boarded the train, and we were off!
  <br><br>
  And whose carriage was Matthew in, but Hugo's! After all this time, we had met once more. Matthew considered walking up to James' nemesis and asking him about the #IKEAmeansIKEA 
  challenge, but decided against it. He was too busy being overwhelmed by the a) not-screaming, b) well-ventilated and c) not-asphyxiating Northern line train - what was this 
  witchcraft? It is well known that those are necessary conditions for the existence of a Northern line train!
  <br><br>
  At Nine Elms, in true NT tradition, Matthew decided to jump on and off, along with plenty of others, equally invested in seeing Nine Elms also. It was built with a common theme 
  to Battersea Power Station Station - lots of polished metal and concrete, and had beautiful air conditioning. Who knows, maybe it will make that bit of the Northern line 
  actually bearable? Nah, just kidding.
  <br><br>
  The train itself was absolutely packed - about 150 passengers had crammed on, and the atmosphere onboard was like a party. What made it even better is that all the staff knew it 
  too! The train terminated at Kennington, to go around the loop and head back to Battersea, so we all trooped off, and crossed over towards the Southbound platform. There was 1 
  poor lady standing on the platform at Kennington, the first commuter we'd seen all day, and the look on her face when 150 party-goers, all completely sober, trooped off the 
  train, wearing a bunch of tube roundels, holding a bunch of cameras, and all following Geoff, was absolutely priceless!
  <br><br>
  As we walked over towards the other platform, I manage to appear in Geoff's video (twice!) - go and check it out!
  <br><br>
  We then assembled on the platform, waiting for our return train. Despite the dot matrix being fucked (they'd obviously not programmed Battersea Power Station Station into the 
  destination list), the train arrived, and we all boarded, heading back to Battersea.
  <br><br>
  Whereas in the train up, Matthew'd been in Hugo's carriage, Matthew did one better here - he was in Jago's carriage! In fact, for the entire journey to Nine Elms, Jago was 
  standing <i>right behind him</i>, and he had no idea! Check out Jago's video to catch a shot of Matthew's bag!
  <br><br>
  Once again, Matthew jumped on and off at Nine Elms (where Jago departed), and the train returned to Battersea, where we all disembarked, and the celebratory atmosphere continued. 
  Everyone quickly found the first dog to have taken the Northern line extension, people grabbed copies of the new tube map and celebratory opening print (although Matthew was 
  too shy to ask for one), and we all watched Geoff film yet more shots. We also discovered that trains here will only serve the Charing Cross branch, so perhaps Matthew's 
  long-held belief that the Northern line will be split is coming true... 
  <br><br>
  After a while, and a brief conversation with the BBC man, Matthew headed upstairs to grab himself a new tube map, passed Geoff yet again, and then headed up to the surface. 
  It was cold up there, so he quickly turned back and headed back down to find the Imperial RailSoc. And yet, on the up escalator, whom should Matthew pass but Geoff himself? 
  He gave Geoff a smile and a wave, and Geoff gave one back - mission accomplished!
  <br><br>
  Matthew then finally met the Imperial RailSoc, and we all headed to get some breakfast, before sitting in the station plaza for an hour or so, as we'd heard news that some VIPs 
  were coming.
  <br><br>
  Whilst we were waiting, we had a conversation with some of the senior TfL staff involved with the project, who viewed this station as their baby, and told us all about the 
  construction in great detail, which was fascinating.
  <br><br>
  We then headed back into the ticket hall, bought a souvenir ticket, and listened to the choir sing about nuclear war, and watched the colourful artwork installation change 
  colours, before Sadiq Khan, Grant Shapps, Andy Byford and Geoff appeared up the escalators. The former 2 gave some speeches before leaving the station, with everyone else 
  in tow. We even walked right beside Geoff briefly! We then stood and milled around for about an hour and a half, talking to various people and watching Sadiq Khan and 
  Grant Shapps give various interviews. We walked with yet more TfL staff, had a lengthy discussion with the editor of the London Underground News magazine (who had been on 
  the first Victoria line train as well), before capping it all off by having a selfie with Geoff! What an excellent morning! James was enormously jealous.
  <br><br>
  But it wasn't quite over yet - we then headed to Nine Elms to investigate that station. This had even more MTR vibes than Battersea, and the most surprising thing was how 
  clean it all was. Seeing "Battersea Power Station" on the dot matrix, as well as the extra branch on the map was also weird though.
  <br><br>
  Before long, the rest of the RailSoc arrived, and we had a good look at the station atrium/ticket hall. I wasn't keen initially, but it gave me Charles Holden vibes and it 
  grew on me. After a few more minutes waiting for the train (they are <i>not</i> frequent - only 5 per hour), we returned to Battersea once more, and headed to the pub for some 
  lunch, seeing the giant flying tube roundel over the power station itself along the way.
  <br><br>
  Matthew really enjoyed getting to know the RailSoc over lunch, and you may well find that they appear in future Alephs - he introduced them to some of the NT ways of life, and 
  they thought it was an excellent idea!
  <br><br>
  Finally, Matthew went home via Quartieri and the British Museum, before spending far too long discussing this very adventure with James, and uploading all the video footage, 
  of which there was so much that he'd had to wipe half his phone's memory to film it all. At long last, after a 29 hour day, Matthew died. Resquiscat in pace.
