  Hey, hey, Mister James, how many pints can you sink today? Is it 10? Is it 12? All we know is "throw the Jew down the well!"
  <br><br>
  Here is a secret look into the life of James, pre-Xi 3, where we came down to London (with painted nails) to meet Usman for a birthday party. Should be 
  great, right? Well this is James, so it will not be. Instead, it will include getting chocked in a railway station, getting completely lost on the fucked 
  tube, having his order in Imperial's student bar completely messed up, getting drunk out of his mind, staggering back to Usman's vey nice South Ken flat, 
  getting completely wiped out on a lethal dose of ethanol, making many REDACTED, REDACTED and REDACTED jokes, encouraging drinking games, gatecrashing 
  Izzy's new flat and drinking someone to death before magically finding himself in Matthew's house 4 miles away, where Xi 3 begins!
