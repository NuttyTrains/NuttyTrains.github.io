This one is going to be a short one, as whilst it was grand and audacious in scale, I was actually rather sensible throughout. Depression must be getting to me or 
summat.
<br><br>
Late in September 2020, Freya was moving to London, and so I volunteered to help her move in. As a result, I had already been out the previous night (Friday) from 
9-11pm to scout out the area/any parking, and had set off at half 1 towards Stratford to help her move in. Along the way, I got trapped in a tunnel due to an 
'incident' at Leyton blocking the entire line, but arrived in Stratford at half 2... only to have to kill an hour and a half (which I did so in the slightly-shitty 
Stratford Centre, which reminded me of a cross between the Quadrant in Swansea and Aberavon Shopping Centre in Port Talbot), whilst trying to avoid the insane 
Nigerian street preacher nutcases dotted around the town. Along the way, I even picked up an accidental Â¬station (which became the subject of an amazing twitter 
competition - congratulations James on your <a href="https://twitter.com/NuttyTrains/status/1307724657521549314">FREE life insurance!</a>)
<br><br>
Eventually, she arrived, and 16 person-trips later, all her stuff had been carted up to her room. I helped her unpack (kind of) for a few hours, before we set off 
towards Waterloo, for her to meet her friends in their accomodation in the South Bank. In Waterloo station, we walked along the travelators, transporting us through 
a steel tunnel deep underground... yet filled with the ambient noises of the Costa Rican rainforest... what a lovely and not-at-all incongruous touch! Once she was 
in their company, I headed home, arriving back at about quarter to 11, whereupon I lay down, exhausted, before cooking myself some noodle concoction (which was 
actually much nicer than it sounds).
<br><br>
Evening over. How lovely. I could sit and eat my noodles and relax.
<br><br>
WRONG! At half 11, I had to put down the remainder of my noodles, put my shoes and my winter coat on, and head back out for tube: round 2!
<br><br>
My plan was to take Freya home to Stratford on the tube, but thanks to the Chock, Sadiq Khan has cancelled the night tube <i>(grumbles in cockney)</i>. Therefore, I 
had to take her home on or before the last tube of the day, which departed Waterloo at 10 to 1 in the morning. To ensure ample walking time to get to the station, 
I would have to be outside the accomodation at half past midnight. And to do this, TfL's journey planner said I would have to catch the 23:35 to Epping. So I rushed 
down the 5 flights of stairs, walked briskly to the station, tapped in (to recieve my now-free journey: woohoo! Daily cap!), and did just that - for once, I was on 
time! I took the train to Bond Street, reading my analysis notes from last year along the way, changed to the Jubilee line, and went all the way to Waterloo. 
I walked briskly to the bus stop in front of the accomodation, thinking I might have a 5 minute buffer, only to discover that I was in fact 20 minutes early - it 
turns out that the default walking speed on TfL's journey planner is staggeringly slower than my walking pace.
<br><br>
So I sat at the bus stop near Waterloo, at quarter past midnight, re-reading and annotating last year's notes on the convergence of series, waiting. God, I am already 
a wreck, and term hasn't even started!
<br><br>
Freya arrived, and we headed back to Waterloo, through the subway filled with fly-tipped rubbish and piss, and made our way through the grand station concourse to 
the Jubilee escalators on the other side, descending into the bowels of the earth. We waited on the platform for a few minutes, before catching the busy penultimate 
train of the night to Stratford. Aside from a loud and boring conversation between the 2 (non-mask-wearing) girls opposite us, the journey was uneventful, and we 
arrived in the cavernous, yet almost vacant station at about 10 past 1. We passed the steam train situated outside the station entrance, walked to her accomodation 
and said goodbye, before I walked to the bus station, beginning my long attempt to get home - this is where the real nuttiness started!
<br><br>
I tend to avoid the night buses where possible, as they are slow, too numerous to know all their routes, and have a very stereotypical composition of passengers - 
I can confirm that the kinds of people you expect to be on the night bus are indeed on the night buses. About half the passengers look really sorry for themselves, 
being world-weary, bedraggled and on the verge of passing out from tiredness (I fall into this category) and the other half are groups of young people, often drunk or 
high or simply on a late night fried chicken kick after returning from the nightclub. Either way, this was going to be just-about-tolerable company for the next 
2 hours.
<br><br>
Stratford bus station looks vast from the outside, but actually only has 5 bays, 4 in the main concourse, and 1 off to the side on its own. Naturally, I walked the 
entire length of the concourse only to discover that my bus (the N25 to Oxford Circus) departed from the other bay. With the exception of a spanish tourist coming 
up and interrogating a passenger as to which bay their mythical bus left from (and in doing so revealed that they did not know West from East), waiting for the bus 
was uneventful, and I boarded at about half past 1.
<br><br>
Social Distancing on this first night bus was not as strict as it had been on the few Welsh buses I had been on in early September. Almost every pair of seats had 
1 person on, unlike the alternating system insisted upon by First Cymru. I sat down towards the back of the top deck, and watched out of the window as we passed West 
Ham, Bow, Stepney Green, Whitechapel and Aldgate, before entering the maze of streets in the City. The bus twisted and turned through the narrow streets, weaving its 
way between the now-desolate skyscrapers. We passed a street which had been modified "for social distancing". I can't say I was aware that cars also needed to keep 2m 
apart at all times, but at least I know now!
<br><br>
The bus passed the Bank of England and St Pauls, before following the central line down through High Holborn (under Holborn Viaduct), and then along towards Oxford 
Street, passing Tottenham Court Road, before terminating just before Oxford Circus. I disembarked from the bus, and started to stroll down the (still rather busy) 
Oxford Street, to the other side of Oxford Circus, towards McDonalds, hoping for a coffee, as it was now gone 2am. Unfortunately, as I arrived there, I noticed that 
the stop just outside McDonalds was closed, and that the bus I needed to catch was not far away.
<br><br>
Oh shit. Here we go again.
<br><br>
So I sprinted down Oxford Street in my winter coat, at 2am, with my analysis folder and fountain pen stowed in my rucksack, weaving in and out of the bemused 
pedestrians, as I attempted to reach the bus stop before my bus. Basically, the only differences between this time and last time were:<br>
a) Oxford Street was not deserted, unlike High Street Kensington<br>
b) I was carrying my analysis folder, not my stats folder<br>
and c) I was running towards my bus, not away from it<br>
This time though, I was successful, and arrived 2 minutes before my bus, meaning I was actually able to catch my breath before embarking upon the N207 to Uxbridge.
<br><br>
This bus was already fairly busy when I boarded, and continued to fill up. This driver clearly had no concept of social distancing, or perhaps she was just kind 
enough to not leave people stranded out in the dark at 2am. The bus passed Bond Street, Marble Arch and Lancaster Gate, by which time every pair of seats on the bus 
was occupied by one person. We passed Queensway and Notting Hill Gate, at which point the bus was so full nearly every single seat was occupied, and I even had 
somebody sit next to me, a shocking occurance in covidtimes! To make matters worse, he had no face mask!
<br><br>
The passenger sitting next to me left after we'd passed Holland Park, just before Shepherd's Bush. A large number of passengers disembarked at Shepherd's Bush, and 
the bus had almost returned to the normal scenario in covidtimes, but then a large group of spanish students arrived, and promptly filled up all the vacant seats 
again, including the one next to me. Fortunately, the one next to me was wearing a mask, and was kind enough to keep quiet, unlike the group of giggling, chatting, 
gawping, maskless women whom he accompanied.
<br><br>
The bus continued down the Uxbridge Road and into Acton, where I disembarked at the old town hall. 5 minutes later, my favourite night bus (and last for the evening) 
arrived, the N266 to Brent Cross. Fortunately, this last bus was almost empty, and I sat at the front of the top deck (perhaps not the best idea, following the 
Winchester bus crash). The bus made its way up through the town, crossing the Great Western Mainline and Western Avenue, before stopping at North Acton Station (which 
is now both my local tube and bus stop), where I finally disembarked. I went into my building, went up the lift and collapsed in my room. It was now 3am. After 
quickly finishing my microwaved dinner, washing up and getting ready for bed, I went to bed exhausted - no more night buses for me!
