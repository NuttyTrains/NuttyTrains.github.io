  On 24/11/21, Matthew left London for the first time since Digamma 2, to go on a RailSoc adventure!
  <br><br>
  Fresh from submitting his classical dynamics coursework, Matthew hopped on his bike and screamed his way to college, as he was late. Again. He had left with only 17 
  minutes to go until the meetup by the Queen's Tower, so he had to go as fast as he could. Nevertheless, he was making record time as he left Kensington Gardens, and 
  had only 1/3 of a mile to go.
  <br><br>
  Then the chain came off. Matthew kept pedalling, hoping that the derailleur would force the chain back onto the cassette. Instead? <strong><i>CRUNCH!</i></strong> 
  The plastic cover for the crankset shattered, meaning that the chain now would come off whenever Matthew tries to change into the outer ring... which is a problem, 
  as Matthew basically never uses anything but the outer ring. He wheeled the bike into the bike park, locked it up, and now having missed the meetup by Queen's Tower, 
  walked to HSK.
  <br><br>
  The District line was delayed at HSK, but nonetheless, Matthew reached Marylebone with plenty of time to spare (a first), arriving even before most of RailSoc! When 
  everyone did arrive, we all got handed our A4-sized tickets, which were extremely interesting (and free!). We need to get ourselves some tickets like this on NT:

  The train to Aylesbury Vale Parkway left at 12:57, and, taking up half a carriage, we set off to Aylesbury, going up the Met. It was a lovely journey up, with everyone 
  sharing random bits of information about railway history (and pacers - don't forget the pacers). We even attracted the attention of an old codger who works on a steam 
  railway! After about an hour, we arrived in Aylesbury, and were greeted by Simon, our guide. We walked out of the station, over the bridge, and down towards the depot 
  itself.

  Once there, our group split in 2, and we headed out into the car park towards the train sim. 2 trainee drivers and an instructor greeted us, and we headed inside to have 
  a go at driving the train. The train sim was awesome. There was a complete working console, complete with lights, switches, and many, many sirens. It was really interesting, 
  actually, finally learning what all those strange noises coming from the cabin were. There was a siren if you took your foot off the dead man's clutch, a siren if a passenger 
  triggered an alarm, a siren if you approached a red signal, and lots of other alert noises for various minor issues. 5 of our group (of 9) took shifts at the console, whilst 
  the instructor threw ever more devious scenarios at them. The first had a lovely sunny day, driving to Haddenham and Thame Parkway. The second had thick snow. The third had 
  snow and a sudden signal change to throw him off. The fourth had impenetrable fog (you couldn't even see the signals), and the 5th and final person had the friction 
  coefficient between the wheels and the rails turned to almost 0, leaving him unable to brake and causing him to overshoot Bicester Village! It was really fun watching the 
  drama unfold between the instructor and the hapless drivers. At one point, their radio system broke (remember this for later).

  Our groups then switched, and we all put on boots and high-vis vests, and headed into the depot itself. 3 trains were inside, all being cleaned down and fixed up. We walked 
  along the entire length of one being serviced, then saw another about to be jacked up with 4 hydraulic jacks. We then headed underneath the belly of the train, into a special 
  lowered walkway, and saw the wheels and engines of the train, which was very cool. Very grimy and oily though, but I suppose that is to be expected. Matthew finally learned 
  what that tire-like thing above the bogeys on the trains are: airbags. You learn something new every day. It was very interesting learning about the various hydraulic, 
  pneumatic, electrical and mechanical tricks that the train uses to operate, but most of it went over Matthew's head, as Matthew isn't an engineer. *spits*.
  <br><br>
  We then headed outside, to see a train about to undergo an exam - presumably the train-equivalent of an MOT. That train is the one seen below:
  <br><br>
  We saw a load of old wheelsets, some from trains no longer with Chiltern, and others which were brand new. It turns out that every year or so, they have to shave the outside 
  of the steel wheel off, to account for any damage it has undergone. They remove 10mm from the radius of the wheel each year in this way! That was astonishing compared to the 
  0.1mm lost per year due to frictional forces. The metal shavings that this process produces would have made great, albeit lethal souvenirs, so Matthew neglected to pick one 
  up. Pacers got mentioned here. Apparently their wheels got 'completely trashed'!

  Our groups then reunited inside for snacks and a group photo, before we returned to Aylesbury station and caught the London train.
  <br><br>
  This should have been the end of the adventure, and as Matthew's phone died, he thought he'd be home soon. But this was not the end of the adventure! Oh no!
  <br><br>
  As we approached Princes Risborough, we came to a halt in the middle of a pitch black field. And stayed there. For 10 minutes. The driver then came on the intercom, and 
  said 'We are currently being held at a red signal. <i>I do not know why</i>'. After 10 more minutes of waiting, he came on the intercom again and explained that his radio 
  was broken, so this train was now going to terminate at Princes Risborough, and we'd be booted onto the next, smaller, busier train. RIP. This was nothing like our sim! 
  In our sim, when the radio was broken, our driver simply kept his foot on the accelerator! There was no stopping to fix the problem or anything!
  <br><br>
  <i>Aside: in all seriousness, having learned about the simulator earlier, this was actually quite a serious problem - it meant that the red signal had been activated 
    because the driver was not responding to any communications, and could well have hurtled straight into danger otherwise: just like the planes in 9/11, or James on his 
    magical mystery tour after he buys a pacer and goes gallivanting across the country!

  When the new train arrived, we piled on, and returned to London. Matthew was taught about headcodes, which hopefully will be useful in tracking our trains during NT Epsilon, 
  and did some problems from a fluids problem sheet. He then disembarked at Wembley Stadium, walked to Wembley Central (what a dump) and headed home.
