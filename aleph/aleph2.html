<p> This is easily worthy of a position in NT. For some reason, Matthew decided to get on a train at 2am in the morning, wander 
hopelessly around Swansea until 4, and then go back home. Why? Just Why? (Much to James' worry)
<br><br>
In late August, it dawned upon Matthew that with the exception of meeting James once earlier in the summer, and seeing everyone 
on Results Day, Matthew hadn't actually done anything all summer. Yet he would be going to sixth form in just a week's time, and 
didn't want to have yet another wasted summer. He decided to do something grand, daring, audacious... and completely stupid. 
<br><br>
Armed with a train timetable, Matthew began searching through all the trains passing through Neath, and became interested in an 
apparent anomaly in the schedule: Paddington trains started at 4am and ended at about midnight, providing regular service, once per 
hour (although they started and ended at different times for different directions). Likewise, the local ATW trains started at 6-ish 
and ended at about half past midnight, providing varying degrees of frequency. This left a gap of 3.5 hours in the night with no 
trains... except one. There was one solitary Swansea-bound service at about 10 past 2 in the morning, and nothing for hours before 
or after (Westbound services started at 6-ish and ended at half-11-ish). This was terribly strange, and picqued Matthew's interest. 
He christened it the milk train (although in hindsight, the milk train would have run at about 5am, as opposed to 2am, but my point 
stands).
<br><br>
And then it dawned on him. To do something exciting in the last weekend of what had meant to have been an amazing summer, he would 
investigate the milk train, before catching the 4am Paddington service home. This was going to be a grand adventure, and he planned 
it extensively beforehand, buying tickets and formulating a plan.
<br><br>
On the the evening of Friday, 1st of September, Matthew went into Neath for a few hours to meet up with a friend from school, and 
then headed home. This in itself was one of the most exciting things to happen all summer, but the excitement was only just about 
to begin. By about midnight, his parents were in bed, and at half past one in the morning, he crept down the stairs, slipped his 
coat and shoes on, and left the house, having practiced this routine countless times before when going on early-morning walks. There 
was only one minor issue with the plan - he forgot to turn the CCTV cameras off. Oops. Fortunately, despite there still being CCTV 
footage on his parents computer of him leaving (and returning), he was never discovered.
<br><br>
Walking down the street, under the acrid glow of the sodium lamps once more felt good. It reminded Matthew strongly of the time he 
went to the Olympics. What was less reassuring was the high volume of police cars patrolling the street, accompanied by the gangs of 
completely pissed women and roving squads of youths. Matthew arrived at the station, using the night entrance, only to find a rowdy 
group of men on the platform and that the train was delayed until half past 2. Yikes.
<br><br>
Matthew killed time by wandering around the station car park, then slipped onto the platform discreetly as the train arrived, and 
headed on his way to Swansea, arriving and exiting swiftly. He then walked quickly down High St, through Castle Square and the city 
centre, swiftly finding his way down to Tesco. After crossing the road in a dodgy place and almost getting killed on a corner, he 
crossed Oystermouth road, passed the library, and reached the seafront.
<br><br>
It was hard to tell which was a deeper black, the sea or the sky. The stars twinkled in the sky, pale pinpricks of shimmering light 
in an ocean of darkness, whilst the warm glow of light from sodium lamps on the opposite side of the bay splashed rippling paintstrokes 
of light across the canvas of the black sea, the shadows of light gently rising and falling in the swell. I must have stood there, 
bathed in orange half-light, standing upon the blanket of sand coating the path, staring at the inky blackness, for about 10 minutes, 
before I slowly moved on.
<br><br>
I walked along the seafront path all the way to the Brangwyn Hall before turning around and retracing my steps. The entire journey 
was a huge nostalgia trip. It brought memories of my last 8 years going to school in Swansea flooding back to me, especially the 
memories of study leave, when we'd gone out and explored Swansea properly for the first time in my life. Even though study leave was 
punctured by a myriad of exams, going out, just for a simple walk, made me very happy indeed, which is how I felt retracing 
my steps that night too. By 3am, Swansea was surprisingly calm, serene and peaceful, and I hardly met anyone in my hour and a half 
walk. I spent a lot of time reflecting on that walk about the future. I would be going to sixth form in just a week, and in 2 years 
time, off to university. My world was changing rapidly after years of being stuck in steady-state. Things weren't going to be the same 
ever again. 
<br><br>
I arrived back at the station just before 4, having walked this time up the deserted Kingsway. Like clockwork, I caught the Paddington 
train, alighted at Neath, walked back through the now-deserted town centre, and slipped back into my house, and quickly went to bed. 
Even though the summer had been a wash-out, I had managed to do one noteworthy thing at the very least.
<br><br>
That is the end of this adventure, but I shall also append my first brief encounter with a Class 800, on only its first day of 
operation, just a few weeks later! For some reason, I had decided to go to Swansea after college one afternoon. I don't remember 
why, but it may have been to see one of my school friends. I arrived at Neath station, and awaited my GWR train.
<br><br>
Yet the train that arrived was different to the ones I'd seen before. I had been expecting an old blue Intercity 125, but instead 
a new shiny green train arrived, resplendent in its dark-green GWR livery. I had inadvertently managed to catch a new Class 800 train 
on its very first day of service! (James, it was 800020, if you are wondering). I was amazed by the new interior, which looked so 
modern and sleek compared to the other trains on the line. I was awed by the LED seat displays replacing the slips of paper in the 
top of each seat. Moreover, it was fast. We arrived in Swansea ahead of schedule, and I immediately set about messaging people 
about the brand-new train I'd seen!
