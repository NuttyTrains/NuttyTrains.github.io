<p> It had all been planned so well. He finished his work on time, caught exactly the right train, and amazingly, found both sets 
of library doors open - it was Matthew's lucky <s>day</s> night!
<br><br>
An hour and a half later, he was sprinting down High Street Kensington at half past 2 in the morning, simultaneously shivering from 
the cold, sweating from sprinting, and crying about his life, hoping to God he could catch the night bus. Why?
<br><br>
Matthew had a plan to tackle his stats coursework, one of many courseworks strung together in a tightly-packed necklace of pearls. For once, his complicated plan 
actually worked well, an unprecedented feat. However, it required some strange sleeping manoeuvres. He woke up that evening, did some chores, did some work from 
that day in uni, and finished his work right on time. He rushed out to the tube station, being slightly later than he'd hoped he'd have been, but managed to catch 
the last tube of the night, so all was going great. On the train, he could barely sit down, pacing back and forth through the empty carriages, even deciding to kill 
time by examining an <strong>Arriva</strong> bus ticket. RIP Arriva. You never lost the license to our hearts.
<br><br>
He walked through Notting Hill and Kensington to college (Hyde Park is closed at night), down Kensington Church Street (his usual walk, albeit reversed) and 
eventually found his way in through an unlocked gate, into college (on the 4th attempt). Matthew thought he had found himself a spot of good luck, and this attitude 
was re-inforced when he found, to his utter astonishment, that both sets of library doors were open! This could not be! In good spirits, he found his way to the 5th 
floor, went to his favourite spot and decided to warm up with an hour spent tackling a problem sheet.
<br><br>
After that, at about half past 1, he turned on the computer, logged on, and clicked on R Studio, ready to start some stats... only to find he couldn't access it. 
Hmm, that was odd. This had never happened before. He thought that perhaps he'd opened the application too quickly.He tried opening it again, but still no luck. 
So he logged off and logged back on again, but it still refused to let him onto R Studio. He turned the computer off and on again, to the same result. Very odd.
<br><br>
He moved his stuff to the next computer over, and tried the same, but still R Studio would not let him on. He moved down to a computer on the floor below, which was 
more intensively used, thinking that any bugs were more likely to be resolved on those computers. Nope, still no stats. Now rather desperate, he went to his 
second-favourite spot to try a computer there. It thought about letting him on, but in the end decided against it. This grand plan was starting to unravel very 
quickly and very disasterously.
<br><br>
The strangest thing was that only the previous day, Matthew had used R Studio just fine in the MLC. But for some reason, this was impossible in the library. 
Therefore, he walked down to tech support, looking for some assistance and a plausible explanation for this strange behaviour, but for some reason was surprised to 
find that there would be no-one there until 9 in the morning. Unlike Matthew, these were clearly normal people. How weird.
<br><br>
He resolved to try one last computer on the ground floor before he would have to try plan B. By pure chance, the desk number of the computer he walked over to was 
1020, his favourite number. This was it. It was a sign. If this failed, he would absolutely have to abandon the library and attempt to find a new way to complete his 
stats coursework. He powered the computer on, logged in, and clicked on R Studio...

<em>Cut to a freezing cold street corner bus stop, complete with its very own sad and dejected Matthew</em>
<br><br>
Having quickly checked the doors to Huxley, to see if there was any chance he could avoid a long journey home, Matthew had made his way to the main road, just 
opposite Queen's Gate into Hyde Park. The next bus was not for another half an hour - he had just about missed the previous one, so he decided to adopt his usual 
strategy and walk along the bus route until it caught up with him - after all, this was probably the sensible option, given the freezing cold. He walked for about 
half an hour, past Hyde Park, past Kensington Church, and along Kensington High Street (by now it was about half past 2).
<br><br>
He got to the 1st bus stop along Kensington High Street proper (about 1/4 of the way down), and saw no bus, so iterating from the previous few stops, he decided to 
continue walking to the next one, which he soon approached, towards the end of the main shopping district of the high street. Fortunately, guess what? The bus was 
now in sight by this point. All seemed well. But something seemed up with the bus stop. What did the sign in front of it say, and why were there road barriers 
erected in front of it? Oh shit.... the bus stop was closed, yet the bus he'd been waiting for was approaching rapidly, about to overtake him, and the next bus wasn't 
for 45 minutes... so Matthew started to run.
<br><br>
So there he was, sprinting down High Street Kensington at half past 2 in the morning, simultaneously shivering from the cold, sweating from sprinting, and crying 
about the sorry situation his life had led him to experience, hoping to God he could catch the night bus. He sprinted for about 1/3 of a mile, along the deserted 
street, jumping over indentations in the pavement, swerving around lampposts and desperately trying to keep pace with the bus, all in the acrid glow of the 
streetlamps, with a heavy bag on his bag and his winter coat fluttering behind him, at almost 3 in the morning.
<br><br>
Luckily the bus driver saw Matthew as he overtook him, and waited for a little longer at the stop (but only because he was had almost reached the stop by the point 
he had been overtaken, and also because the disembarking passengers had taken what seemed like an eternity to leave the bus), meaning he was able to throw himself 
through the doors as the bus was indicating to leave, fumble for his Oyster card, stagger upstairs, sit down and collapse from exhaustion. The ordeal was over.
<br><br>
The rest of the journey/quest to complete his stats was less eventful. Matthew changed at Hammersmith from the 9 to the 218, and alighted outside Woodward. He got R 
Studio working on his laptop, and spent the rest of the night (and much of the following day) working to complete the coursework in time. This story has a happy 
ending though, as he ended up with 100% on that coursework. Perhaps desperately throwing himself down Kensington High Street at half past 2 in the morning was worth 
the trouble after all.
