<p> So we all know that Cornwall is isolated, also we know that Public Transport is awful on a Sunday. James went down to the most 
isolated part of the UK, on a Sunday, what could go wrong? A lot.
</p>
<p> So it was a sunday, James had nothing to do, he had an idea to go to an amateur radio session. This story isn't long but it requires 
the certain level of masochism in the first place to consider it! The session was at Poldhu Cove, Lizard. If you know anything about the Lizard, 
you know that it is ridiculously hard to get to. Luckily James had an idea, he would cut the journey time, by getting a train to Redruth, brilliant,
amazing, he thought he was a genius. He arrives at Redruth, where is the bus? This is weird, the bus was supposed to leave in 5 minutes... until James hears:<br>
<em>Redruth Citizen</em>: A'wight bwuv, you lookin for L1.<br>
<em>James</em>: As it is, yes I am. <br>
<em>Crachead</em>: Left ten 'inits ago. Want some dope or cwac. <br>
<em>James Exits</em><br>
The man had no teeth, was wearing a fluffy wolf jumper, traditional Camruthful attire and seemed to be a drug dealer. Like a fat baker addicted to cakes.
From then he decided to get a taxi, he grabbed some cash and found some decent bloke to take him to Poldhu. The driver looked at him and then said:
<em>Drive</em>: £70<br>
<em>James:</em>: No. I'd rather walk<br>
<em> James walks back to the station </em><br>
<em>The taxi driver drives up</em><br>
<em>Drive</em>: £30<br>
<em>James</em>: £10<br>
<em>Drive</em>: £20<br>
<em>James</em>: £12<br>
<em>Drive</em>: £10<br>
<em>James, cheekily</em>: £10<br>
So James got to Poldhu and had his session, mainly trying to communicate with anybody he could. He then got back to Helston, time for nuttyness! So he went from 
Helston to Penryn, on the U4, which is usually a lot of fun, then a U2 to Redruth, James' regular bus service. Finally he got on a T2, <strong>T2 tucker!</strong>
(you can blame Lottie for that!) and then home.
