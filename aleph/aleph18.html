Didn't get on a single train here, but ticked off as many ¬stations as we do stations on some adventures. Walked for 25.4 miles, over the course of 11 hours. In 
addition to the station detours, I also printed work off in college, paced up and down Hyde Park for half an hour, on the phone, paced up and down Liverpool Street 
concourse for 10 minutes, and visited Sherfield, McDonalds, Boots, Superdrug and Westfield.

It was a lovely summery day, and I was fed up of being cooped up inside, so I decided I was going to go on a long walk to college to print off my work, and go an 
interesting, new way, avoiding the worst sections of the Westway (like my previous route), and pick up some ¬stations along the way.
<br><br>
I started off by walking across the street to Tesco to buy lunch, and then walked down towards Western Avenue. I walked along Western Avenue for a short distance, until 
I reached East Acton, then turned down to walk through Acton Vale. I passed a park, crossed the Uxbridge Road, and eventually winded up at Ravenscourt Park, my first 
¬station of the day. 
<br><br>
I walked along Hammersmith High Street to Hammersmith, passing many interesting shops, before negotiating the central shopping centre and the road network under the 
Hammersmith flyover. Eventually I made my way up Kensington High Street, passing Olympia and HSK, then diverted through the back streets of Kensington, along my usual 
back route to college, stopping off at Gloucester Road to tick it off, then headed into Huxley.
<br><br>
Once in the Central Library, I printed my notes and left. I walked over to Sherfield to get coffee, my traditional first year coffee that got me through lectures. 
After this, I walked down to South Kensington then Brompton Road. I passed the abandoned Brompton Road station, passed Harrods and Knightsbridge for the first time, then 
entered Hyde Park, where I called Tyler. I paced up and down on the phone for about half an hour, before continuing up to Hyde Park Corner.
<br><br>
I hadn't really intended to walk any further, but as I was meeting Freya in the centre later, and I was about to walk to new and virgin territory, I decided to continue, 
to help join up my disparate maps of inner London. I walked up past the Japanese embassy, Green Park, and then entered familiar territory by Piccadilly. I continued 
past Chinatown and into Leicester Square, then made my way up past Covent Garden and Holborn finally connecting up my mental map of central London and all the seperate 
areas I was familiar with. Finally, I followed the Central line to Liverpool St, a walk I have done a few times before all whilst talking to Matthew about the news. 
<br><br>
I arrived at Liverpool St with a low phone battery, so decided from here onwards that I would conserve charge. I paced up and down the station, having asked Freya to meet 
me there, walking up and down the concourse, even though there was a massive police presence and I was worried there had been a crash or a terror attack. Eventually, she 
said she had gone to Chancery Lane, so I doubled back to St Pauls to meet her.
<br><br>
We walked down towards Holborn, eventually finding an open McDonalds, where we bought dinner, and sat on the lower windowsill of a large office, unaware that just around 
the corner was a bench. We continued walking to Tottenham Court Road, whereupon we joined busy Oxford Street. I walked with her all the way along Oxford Street, stopping 
at Bens Cookies for dessert, and Boots and Holland & Barrett for medicines, supplements and hair dye. We got to Marble Arch, crossed along the side of the Marble Arch 
gyratory, and then kept walking along the upper side of Hyde Park all the way to Bayswater/Queensway. I tried to persuade her to go home at this point, as she was very 
tired, which she did at HNG. 
<br><br>
I continued on, passing Holland Park and onto Westfield. I was at this point desperate to have a wee, which I did at Shepherd's Bush station (near Westfield). I then 
kept walking through the rougher areas along the Uxbridge Road, walking through Shepherd’s Bush and Acton. My phone was now critically low, and I was desperately trying 
to pick off the final remaining ¬stations on my route. It was now extremely late, nearing midnight, and the Uxbridge Road was almost abandoned, save for the occasional 
car. I turned up past Acton Park to get a photo of Acton Central, made my way up the deathly quiet residential streets in Acton, which were in fact very peaceful.
<br><br>
At last, I made it to my final ¬station, Acton Main Line. I pulled out my phone, turned it on, opened the camera and quickly snapped a picture, with my phone dying 
before it was even able to save the full resolution version. Below, I present to you the final, amazing-quality image from my trek across London. Isn't it glorious?
<br><br>
I staggered up Horn Lane and across Western Avenue back home, walking up all the stairs to my flat, and collapsing on my bed. I had walked 25.4 miles and ticked off 
32 ¬stations over the course of 12 hours, so needless to say this was an adventure and a half.
