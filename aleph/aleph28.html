  Oh my God, an Aleph? I haven't written one of these in <i>years</i>.
  <br><br>
  In truth I wasn't going to write this, until I was reminded of &#x2135;<sub>23</sub>: Matthew met Geoff. This is a nice 
  (albeit much shorter) companion piece. I travelled down from Leeds in the afternoon, after submitting my final written exam, 
  and arrived at Kings Cross at 5. It is always nice to be back in London. Surprisingly, it is also nice to be back in Imperial 
  now that the trauma has faded...

  I was attending a lecture by Jago Hazzard, about the Northern Heights programme, hosted by Imperial RailSoc. The lecture was 
  very enjoyable, and it was nice to meet yet another person that Alex has not. See attached photographic proof below:

  Thus concludes the first (and probably last) Aleph in 3 years. If Alex wrote up all of their adventures, we'd be on 100 Alephs per year...
