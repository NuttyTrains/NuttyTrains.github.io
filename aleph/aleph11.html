<p> When Freya was down for the weekend, Matthew took her sight-seeing around London - at night. We saw many, many sights, both 
intended and unintended!
<br><br>
On a Friday afternoon in late October, exactly 4 weeks after we had last departed, Freya was coming down to London for the first time, 
to see me and stay over for the weekend. I left North Acton at about 3, and took the central line to Notting Hill Gate, before 
taking the Circle line to Victoria. Having scouted the station before, I followed my previous route through the station and down the 
street to Victoria Coach Station. However, Freya was not yet there - her coach was delayed. I went and bought her some flowers in 
the meantime, before heading back to see her for the first time in 4 weeks. All was right in the world again.
<br><br>
We headed back to my flat, and spent a few hours there. We eventually decided that we would try a Korean restaurant in Ealing, so 
we set off, arrived in Ealing Broadway, and walked through the town centre to the restaurant. We headed downstairs, sat at a table 
for two, and looked at the menu. I ordered fried udon noodles, and Freya bibimbap.
<br><br>
We ate our meal, sat and talked for a while, and then wrapped up warm and headed out into the cold of the night. It was roughly 10pm 
at this point, but we decided not to go home just yet - we wanted to go exploring in London first!
<br><br>
We caught the central line in Ealing Broadway and rode it all the way until Oxford Circus. The last time we had been to Oxford Circus, 
we'd barely been able to move, so we were quite surprised to find that the street was pretty desolate - there were only a few isolated 
groups around. Taking advantage of the lack of crowds, we walked up the street. Among many others, we passed Muji, Lush and Whittard, 
before arriving at Tottenham Court Road. We then doubled back, passing one of the country's largest Primarks.
<br><br>
We passed Oxford Circus again, before passing all of the famous giant department stores and the Disney store on our way towards Bond Street. 
We also witnessed a car drive the wrong way down a street, for some reason. We got back on the tube and headed to Piccadilly Circus. 
<br><br>
We disembarked and exited the station, and saw the dazzling neon displays, providing a backdrop to the Eros statue in front of us. 
We didn't spend long at Piccadilly Circus, as we'd been there during the summer, but I managed to see the giant illuminations 
at night for the first time, which has been something I've wanted to see for over a decade.

We then took the Piccadilly to Green Park and the Jubilee to Westminster, where we ascended up the series of escalators to the 
surface. Westminster station has an absolutely vast, towering atrium, almost 50m high, filled with steel pipes and concrete 
balconies, alongside criss-crossing stairwells and entangled escalators. Freya said that the sci-fi ethos of the station, bedecked 
in polished chrome panels, contrasting against the masses of grey-beige concrete, reminded her of settings from first person 
shooter games. It is a really surreal station.
<br><br>
The station is so surreal that when we saw Big Ben just a few minutes later, Freya was seriously underwhelmed. It didn't help that the 
tower was covered in scaffolding. We both took each other's photo in front of the London Eye, and then crossed the Thames on 
Westminster bridge. We walked up to the London Eye, passed under Hungerford Bridge, and then headed towards Waterloo, to try and 
catch the Jubilee line towards home, as it was now very late.
<br><br>
Except we struggled to find the entrance to Waterloo tube station. The main station was barracaded off (it was about 1am), and all 
the tube entrances within sight were closed too. To my horror/upset, we were now in an unfamiliar bit of London, pretty lost, at 1am 
on a Satuday morning. This was terrible.
<br><br>
Thanks to Freya, we walked back to Westminster, across the eponymous bridge. We descended the steps to the river embankment, aiming 
to use the waterside entrance, only to be told by 2 men that we were unable to enter, and should use the main entrance.
<br><br>
We crossed the street to the main entrance, only to find numerous ambulances and paramedics stationed outside. Crap. This was bad. 
They were wheeling stretchers into the station building. We scurried inside to find them congregating in the corridor leading to 
the waterside exit. It looked as if someone had been stabbed, just minutes between us leaving that exit and us rearriving! That 
was truly terrifying. (Nothing appeared on the news afterwards though, so perhaps everything was alright... hopefully).
<br><br>
We went back down to the deep Jubilee platforms, and were greeted by dozens of tiny mice, scurrying back and forth along the platform. 
They ran up to each other, touched noses, and then started endlessly sniffing the platform in circles. Despite having been in London 
for 4 weeks, this was still one of my first times seeing mice on the tube, and both of us were very enamoured. When we arrived in 
Bond Street to await our train home, we saw even more, scurrying back and forth.
<br><br>
Our train arrived, now solidly into its Night Tube schedule, and we headed back to North Acton. It had been a very long evening 
(We were out even later than I would be 2 months later for Ï™1), and we were both tired.
<br><br>
We had a very eventful weekend after that. We went back to Oxford Street to visit the shops we'd picked out in the evening, and 
we went to Twinings on the Strand. We also went to Ichiba in Westfield London and Pizza Hut in Bayswater. Unfortunately, she had to 
depart on Sunday evening, which was very upsetting.
<br><br>
I will append to this account my train journey just 2 weeks later, to Bristol and Bath. I set off from North Acton at 6:30am, caught 
the 7am IET from Paddington, and went to Bristol Temple Meads, where I met Freya. Along the way, I'd admired the rolling hills and 
greenery of the railway's surroundings. It was a bitterly cold, freezing morning. We went to get coffee in the city centre, and 
spent the day wandering around, visiting various shops. All too quickly, however, it was time to depart, which was even more upsetting 
than it had been in London 2 weeks prior.
<br><br>
It had not been a hugely successful day for me either. I managed to lose one of my socks in the wash that morning (although I later 
rediscovered it, 4 weeks later), then left my phone charger on the train and my gloves on the tube in the evening. 
<br><br>
I did, however, have a very nice evening visiting Ewan in Bath (at short notice). Having eventually managed to catch a unibus, I 
headed up the hill to Bath Uni (the reader is forgiven for wondering whether NT secretly revolves around Bath), and saw Ewan and 
his flat. After many hours talking, we headed back into town, and ate at Pizza Express (see, I told you this was an NT adventure),
before my train arrived at 10pm, and I headed home once more.
