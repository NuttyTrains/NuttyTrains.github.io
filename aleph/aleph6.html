<p> Matthew and Freya caught a very early train to Bristol (via Bristol Parkway), to go to the Bristol Uni open day. This turned 
out to be a very important day for us, despite the mad dash for the train home.
<br><br>
I woke up at 5:30am, and very early on, walked down to Neath train station. I caught the 6:41am train to Port Talbot Parkway, whereupon 
I disembarked to wait for Freya. She arrived at about 10 to 8 (when we had agreed to meet), found seats together and took the train 
all the way to Bristol Parkway.
<br><br>
When buying the tickets, Freya had mistakenly bought advance tickets to and returning from Bristol Parkway. Unfortunately, Bristol 
Parkway is a desolate wasteground nowhere near Bristol. We had rectified this by buying an extra ticket from Parkway to Temple Meads 
for her, but this meant we had to perform a slightly awkward manoeuver - travel to Bristol Parkway, and then change to the commuter 
line running through the city (which, at the time, was undergoing extensive reconstruction).
<br><br>
This was completely successful in the morning, but the CrossCountry train we caught was very busy (and smelt slightly funny), but 
we were only on there for a few minutes, before we exited Bristol Temple Meads. We got slightly lost in walking through one of the new 
redevelopments on the riverside, but we soon reached the north bank of the river, and quickly progressed through the city centre. 
<br><br>
We took a strange route, up the famous Christmas steps, and ascended successively steeper hills to the Cathedral at the bottom of the 
campus. At this point, I left Freya to attend her first event, and sprinted up the hill to my first talk, in 5 minutes. I greatly 
enjoyed the maths talk, in constrast to the maths talk I'd been to at my previous Bristol open day. Freya then attended my physics 
talk afterwards.
<br><br>
We then both headed to one of the university's annex buildings for a classics talk, before heading to an older, central building, 
surrounded by greenery, for her history talk, which she unfortunately did not enjoy. Finally, we went to her modern languages talk 
(after almost getting lost in a maze of corridors), and saw all the modern languages they had to offer there.
<br><br>
Between the history and modern languages talks, we also went to visit the university's newest flagship student accomodation block, 
which impressed both of us (although I had visited previously).
<br><br>
We walked back into the old town and started exploring for a bit. We visited Stamfords, a huge map and mapbook store, and spent 
excessively long there, immersed in the all the books. In fact, it was a ratherly over-excessive amount of time to spend there, as 
we then had limited time in which to reach the station. Despite walking at a quick pace all the way to Temple Meads, we had to sprint 
the last section. 
<br><br>
We sprinted up the long driveway to the station, legged it through the ticket office, passed through the barriers, and headed for the 
stairs. I practically threw myself down the stairs, inadventently leaving Freya behind, ran down the concourse, and leapt up the stairs 
to our platform, where our train to Bristol Parkway was waiting, ready to depart.
<br><br>
Except Freya wasn't there.
<br><br>
So I ran to the train, put one foot through the door, and left the other on the platform, and I stood there, half-in, half-out, 
for a full minute, whilst the guard shot murderous looks at me. The train was now delayed, thanks to me.
<br><br>
Freya ran up the stairs, jumped aboard, and we both headed to find seats. She was absolutely exhausted after so much running, and 
still hadn't recovered 15 minutes later when we arrived at Parkway. Indeed, I spent those 15 minutes apologising for making her 
run so fast and for so long, but at least we had made our train!
<br><br>
Except it had all been in vain. Our train was delayed by 20 minutes, meaning we could have comfortably caught the next train from 
Temple Meads, without running at all. Such is my life. We finally caught our train home, whereupon Freya headed to her friend's 
18<sup>th</sup> birthday party.
<br><br>
Except... it hadn't all been in vain. She was really touched. She'd really enjoyed watching me all day.
<br><br>
2 months later, we became boyfriend and girlfriend &#10084;
