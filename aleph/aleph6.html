<p> Matthew and Freya caught a very early train to Bristol (via Bristol Parkway), to go to the Bristol Uni open day.
<br><br>
I woke up at 5:30am and walked to Neath train station. I caught the 6:41am train to Port Talbot Parkway, then later continued to Bristol Parkway.
<br><br>
Freya had bought advance tickets to and returning from Bristol Parkway - a desolate wasteground nowhere near Bristol. We had rectified this 
by buying an extra ticket from Parkway to Temple Meads, but this meant we had to perform an awkward manoeuver - travel to Bristol Parkway, and 
then change to the commuter line running through the city (which, at the time, was undergoing extensive reconstruction). 
This worked in the morning, but the CrossCountry train we caught was very busy (and smelt awful).
<br><br>
We walked up the famous Christmas steps, and ascended successively steeper hills to the Cathedral at the bottom of the 
campus. At this point, I sprinted up the hill to my first talk in 5 minutes, which I enjoyed. We then went to a classics talk followed by an awful 
history talk and a modern languages talk. We also went to visit the university's newest student accomodation block (better than most).
<br><br>
We walked back into the old town and started exploring. We visited Stamfords, a huge map and mapbook store, and spent 
excessively long there - we then had limited time in which to reach the station: we had to sprint the last section of the journey. 
<br><br>
We sprinted up the long driveway to the station, legged it through the ticket office, passed through the barriers, and headed for the 
stairs. I practically threw myself down the stairs, leaving Freya behind, ran down the concourse, and leapt up the stairs 
to our platform, where our train to Bristol Parkway was waiting, ready to depart.
<br><br>
Except Freya wasn't there.
<br><br>
So I ran to the train, put one foot through the door, and left the other on the platform, and I stood there, half-in, half-out, 
for a full minute, whilst the guard shot murderous looks at me. The train was now delayed, thanks to me.
<br><br>
Freya eventually staggered up, came aboard, and sat down. She was exhausted and still hadn't recovered 15 minutes later when we arrived at Parkway. 
Unfortunately it had all been in vain. Our train was delayed by 20 minutes, meaning we could have comfortably caught the next train from 
Temple Meads, without running at all. Such is my life.
