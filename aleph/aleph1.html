<p> During study leave one day, Matthew decided to go home on the train, which was a first. Unfortunately, he made some critical 
mistakes.
	<br><br>
This is quite a short adventure, but still an amusing story. It was study leave in Year 11, in early June. By this point, some 
people had finished all their exams, and everyone left had only 1 or 2 to go (Matthew had 4 or 5, if memory serves me correctly), 
so naturally, everyone was spending most of their time pissing around and being clique. This didn't please Matthew, so at 1 o'clock, 
he decided to go home on the train, which he had never actually done before.
	<br><br>
Matthew signed out on the register, and walked down the crescent, turned onto Walter Road, and walked towards the train station. 
It was a reasonably short walk, which took 20-ish minutes (Matthew's walking pace was slower back then), before he arrived at the 
station and went to the ticket office.
	<br><br>
Matthew: Can I have a child single to Neath please?
Ticket Lady: Are you sure you won't be coming back? A return is much cheaper than 2 singles<br>
Matthew: <em> I'm sure </em>
	<br><br>
Matthew caught the train and triumphantly arrived in Neath, happy that he had managed to get home and avoid another 3 hours of pissing 
about and cliqueiness. We walked home, only to find that there was no car in the drive, and no-one was home. This was a problem. 
He decided instead to walk up the hill to his grandparents' house, only to find they were also absent. This was a big problem.
Here, I ought to explain why I have included this as an NT adventure:
	<br><br>
Matthew had brought money that day, anticipating that he might want to catch the train.<br>
However, Matthew had not brought his keys, as he assumed that someone would be home to let him in (in his defense, it was half past 2, 
and Ffynone didn't finish until 4, so this was a reasonable assumption).<br>
Furthermore, he had no mobile phone, so was unable to contact anyone to say where he was.<br>
So now you see why this was a problem.
	<br><br>
With no way to get into the house, neither any means of contacting anyone to say where he was, the outcome of the scenario would 
have been distinctly unpleasant. So Matthew was forced to go back to the train station, and buy another ticket!
	<br><br>
Matthew: Can I have a child single to Swansea?<br>
Ticket Lady: Would you like a return?<br>
Matthew: No, this time I am sure I only want a single.
	<br><br>
The train arrived in Swansea at about 25 to 4, giving only 15 minutes before his mum would pull up on the hashed yellow lines, 
expecting him to be out immediately (which, by the way, never happened). So he ran. He ran for as long as he could (not very long 
at the time), and powerwalked the rest, back though the city, back up the hill, back along Walter Road (running into his music 
teacher along the way), and up to the school, seeing his mum parked, as predicted, on the hashed yellow lines, waiting impatiently. 
He dived into the car (before 5 to 4), received his daily bollocking for being late, and headed home. Again.
	<br><br>
The moral of this traumatic experience for Matthew was to always carry his keys and his phone. As with everything, he learnt the 
hard way.
