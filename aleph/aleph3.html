<p> So you know that it takes two hours to get to Exeter on the train? Well James did this every saturday for
four months to get a couple of STEP qualifications, just for fun. He is still yet to do STEP III.
<br>
STEP was a wonderful time, the usual trip was from Newquay, along the branchline to Par, still James' favourite piece of 
track on the network, even more than HoW. So he would then wait for 30 minutes or more to get up the line to Exeter! It was usually 
uneventful, I usually worked on Further Maths or if I was running behind on the problem sheet from last week, then it was to be worked
on the way up.<br>
I would then walk to Exeter Mathematics School, to do the session, I distinct remember my first session I was early and they weren't 
expecting anybody but I turned up and ruined that! So myself and the tutor got on with some problems and this was to start the beginning
of my relationship with hard maths problems, which would drain the last remaining sanity out of my body and keep me going through the year 
to follow with all it's problems, because remember a maths problem can break you mentally but it only a good problem can heal your emotional
state.<br>
On one particular Saturday I had missed the branchline and I remember specifically going to St Austell instead with my father, who really doesn't
do public transport, let alone trains. He was amused by the length of the HST.<br>
The sessions would last 4 hours, so it was worth going to, usually they'd involve Nick telling us some weird and whacky Maths thing and then doing
a problem sheet on them. I miss a lot about those sessions and still value and use the Maths I learnt, we did a lot of integration stuff and I loved it.<br>
Then after these session's I'd head to McDo Exeter and then onwards to EXD and back home, if I was lucky enough to get the train.
</p>
<p> One of the 'STEP' times that I remember was when I went for an extra session with my tutor, this was a Friday and I remember being slightly lenient with the 
time that day, wanting to get the most out of my money. It should also be noted that on this day, James has an advance first class tiket, noted as the start of the 
curse of the first class ticket. So I knew that I was short on time, so I got a lift back to the train station. I arrive at the station and I run to the platform and 
then I see the train run off down to the platform back down south.<br>
So James headed back into Exon, ready to find some food, as at this time, he was hungry. Luckily James' father was passing by so he could get a lift, but he headed to 
Pizza Expressto wait out the time it takes his father to get there. Luckily this Pizza Express is extremely scenic, it overlooks the Cathedral. The Pizza was good and 
James got home... eventually.

<p><small>As a footer to this, it is worth noting that every Saturday in September and October 2018, Matthew took the train to Swansea for 
MAT sessions. Due to this being a short journey on a non-pacer line, very few interesting things happened, although as Ewan will 
testify, we missed more than one train due to Matthew thinking it was a good idea to get out of bed at 08:20 to catch an 08:32 
train. The only exception to this was Matthew once catching a 6:00-ish train to Swansea, because why not? After MAT, Matthew, 
Ewan and Freya would walk back to Swansea, Ewan would go home, and Matthew and Freya would have study dates in various cafes.</small>
