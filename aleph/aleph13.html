<p> What could break James' Northophobia? What could break James' Terra Incognita? What could scare James shitless? That's right, 
it was time for MathJam Annual Gathering 2019, in Stone via Brummy. ft. James Grime, Matt Parker and a Quadruple Electrified Pacer! (Don't 
you worry the land only stopped a few miles north of Stone, so James didn't dare go any more North)
</p>
<p>Good Morning! I am off to Annual Maths Jam Gathering today. This is held in Stone and I will be taking my favourite mode of 
transport, the train! Join me, on the adventure and remember, This isn't tourism, this is masochism!</p>
<p> There will be updates throughout the day, so keep an eye on this space</p>
<p><b><em> Update 1: 1019 CBN </em></b></p>
<p>I am at Camborne ready and raring to go! I can see the 800 arriving from the distance let's go!</p>
<p> I have taken my seat, let's go! </p>
