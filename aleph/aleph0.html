<p> We have written the story of James's first encounter with a train, but the story of Matthew's first encounter with a train remains 
unwritten... until now!
<br><br>
Okay, that is a lie. My childhood fascination with Thomas the Tank engine meant that I'd been on plenty of steam trains in my time, 
but it wasn't until I was 10 years old that I rode on a modern train, and what a way to start it was! (Also, this will be written 
in 1st person, not in my usual disembodied 3rd person, because that would be inappropriate here).
<br><br>
In 2012, the Olympics were in London, so my Dad bought 2 tickets for me and him to see one of the athletics heats in the Olympic 
Stadium. He had also tried to buy tickets for a cycling heat in the Velodrome, but these had sold out. He managed to get some 
morning tickets, meaning we'd have to set off very early in the morning to reach London on time. Therefore, we bought tickets for 
the 4:09am train from Neath to Paddington.
<br><br>
That morning, I was woken up at 2am and we got ready to leave the house at half past 3, before walking down to the station. 
Embarassingly, I took my dad's camera and took frequent film clips over the course of the day, which I refuse to watch on principle.
<br><br>
Neath at night was a very strange place. From what I had been told, I had expected it to be filled with raging drunks, littered 
with needles, and there to be an unsavoury character around every street corner. Yet there was none of that. Neath was dead. 
Completely and utterly dead. There wasn't a single person, a single car engine, or even a breath of wind. The only noise was of our 
echoing footsteps. That night, the stars were on full display, yet the town and the sky was drowned in the acidic orange light from 
the ubiquitous sodium streetlamps. Every wall glowed bright orange, every paving slab shone brightly and the sky burnished above us, 
less black than orange.
<br><br>
We entered the station using the night entrance, and soon enough our train, an Intercity 125 pulled up, and we settled in for the 
long 3 hour journey ahead of us. My dad fell asleep, but I was awake the whole way. Even though I couldn't see out of the window 
due to the extreme darkness, I took note of the stations as we passed them - Neath, Port Talbot Parkway, Bridgend, Cardiff Central, 
Newport, Bristol Parkway, Swindon, Didcot Parkway, Reading, and London Paddington.
<br><br>
Despite it being the height of summer, it was only light enough to see outside by about Didcot, where I saw numerous other Intercities 
parked up. On the line past Reading, I asked why the train wasn't stopping at all the little stations (I specifically asked about 
Iver, which along with the other little stations, forms part of TfL Rail at the time of writing). Before long, we pulled into the 
capital, and entered the magnificence of Paddington. Paddington's gracious arches would be enough to stun James years later, so you 
can only imagine the effect it had on me at age 10. 
<br><br>
That was my first ever train journey, but it was not my only first that day, for this was my first ever time visiting London (ironic 
then, that by the end of the same decade I am living in London). By extension of that fact, it was to be my first ever time on the tube. 
To make matters worse, it was about half past 7 and approching rush hour.
<br><br>
We bought tickets at the ticket machine (I still have mine at home), and went down the stairs, through the ticket barrier and turned left 
for the Bakerloo line. The Bakerloo line, as mentioned elsewhere, has an old-timey, almost Sherlock Holmes feel to it. It has a brown 
moquette, very 70s ends to the seats, and a series of other antiquated features that just make it seem incredibly charming and twee. 
What isn't twee about the Bakerloo line is the incessant shaking and rumbling as it travels down the line, often in quite a circuitous 
manner.
<br><br>
I didn't really appreciate the charm of the Bakerloo line, having been crammed into a busy commuter-rush train for the first time, 
on a loud train in a dark tunnel, surrounded by people much much bigger than me. After all, I was well under 5ft tall at the time, 
and simply unable to reach the handrails at the top of the carriage. Instead, I stuck to my dad tightly, hoping the crush didn't 
worsen.
<br><br>
I was wrong.
<br><br>
We changed at Oxford Circus to the Central Line, and this train was significantly hotter, denser and longer than the previous. 
Even to this day, I have only ever seen 1 tube train more packed than this one (it was so packed I couldn't physically fit on), 
but my opinion of this train was certainly worsened by my relative height to everyone else. In fact, I was deeply troubled by the 
crush of people by the time we exited the train (along with most others) at Stratford, and began the long walk from the 
inconveniently-located station to the Olympic Park.
<br><br>
Along the way, I had fleeting moments of terror when my dad first let go of my hand, then appeared to forget I was there and speed 
up, all whilst we were in the biggest crowd of people I have ever seen, before or since.
We passed various bilingual (English-French) banners, before the Orbit Tower and the various venues came into view. I pointed out the 
various stadia, having studied them extensively, before we reached the Olympic Stadium itself, climbed the stairs, and took our 
seats. The stadium was absolutely enormous! It seemed larger than a meteor crater, filled to the brim with cheering fans. There were 
giant screens around the stadium, beaming live feeds of the fans, and counting down until the morning's events began.
<br><br>
I don't remember a huge amount about the events themselves, other than that they all happened more-or-less simultaneously, rather 
than sequentially. I do remember the sounds of cheers echoing around the stadium, following the runners as they circled the track 
in one of the longer running events. I also remember the TV camera pointed at the fans just a few rows below me, meaning that I 
very nearly appeared on TV (but fortunately didn't). 
<br><br>
Luckily, I kept extensive records of the games themselves, allowing me to fill in some of the blanks. On that day, the 7th of August, 
I went to see the 10am Athletics event, in the main Olympic Stadium. The events that day were:<br>
Women's Javelin Qualifying,<br>
Men's 110m Hurdles Heats,<br>
Men's Triple Jump Qualifying,<br>
Women's 5000m Heats,<br>
and Men's 200m Heats.
<br><br>
I vaguely remember the triple jump and javelin events, although they took place on the opposite side of the stadium to me, so I didn't get a 
particularly good look at them. I also vaguely recall the 110m hurdles. The women's 5000m heats lasted a very good while, as they circled 
round and around the track, followed by a perennial wall of cacophanous cheering, rotating around the stadium as the women passed each stand. 
The highlight of the event was the 200m heats, in which Usain Bolt appeared. They were off like rockets, doing a half lap of the stadium, to absolutely 
rapturous cheers and applause. It was a fantastic spectacle to behold!
<br><br>
The event finished at lunchtime, and we left the stadium, heading out towards the food court near the Orbit tower. However, as it was exceptionally busy, we 
decided against getting food and trying to go up the tower. We instead decided to head into London. Stratford station was packed, so instead, 
we were directed by crowd martials along the long landscaped path to West Ham tube station, a distance of a few miles, which was a very pleasant walk. 
We got on the District line (and actually had seats), and rode the tube all the way to Westminster. In hindsight, this means that 
I actually had a chance to ride on the old D stock, which I wouldn't have had a clue about at the time. We then alighted and saw 
Big Ben from almost directly below the clock tower, something which I have since repeated with both Freya and James. 
<br><br>
We walked past Westminster Abbey and up Parliament Street to Trafalgar Square, if memory serves me correctly. After seeing Trafalgar 
Square, we walked through Admiralty Arch and up The Mall to Buckingham Palace. We then went and sat in Green Park, where we bought a Team GB-emblazoned 
Union Flag (which is still in my room today), then got on the tube and took the Jubilee and Bakerloo lines back to Paddington (thank you 10 year old Matthew for 
annotating the tube map!).
<br><br>
At about 4pm, we arrived back in Paddington, quite possibly via Lancaster Gate. I had lunch from one of the sandwich shops there, 
and we caught the train home. The train journey back was equally uneventful, except the couple opposite us occasionally argued about 
where they should alight. We arrived home late in the evening and were picked up in the car and taken home, after a very long and 
exciting day.
