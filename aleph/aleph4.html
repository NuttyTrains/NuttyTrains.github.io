<p> Matthew decided it was a great idea to catch a train to Llanelli, and just walk to Parc Trostre from there, 
through various rotten bits of Llanelli. Definitely a great idea.
<br><br>
Matthew had been trying to meet with a friend from school for quite some time (I believe that the first class 800 encounter was 
one such failed attempt), so decided in that December to bite the bullet and go straight to where he worked in Parc Trostre. 
He had only ever been to Swansea on his own on the train before, so going further was a novel experience. Those were the days...
<br><br>
It was a fairly miserable day, with a light sheet of mizzle clinging to everywhere. Matthew headed down to Neath, bought a ticket, 
and caught an ATW train to Llanelli. After about half an hour, he arrived at the station (which has a level crossing, as would be 
pointed out to James in ϡ6), and exited onto a backstreet, somewhere in southern Llanelli.
<br><br>
It is at this point I should add that not only had Matthew never been to Llanelli via train before, he had never actually been to 
Llanelli full stop (it is not hard to see why this was practice for later NT adventures). He opened Google maps, and began to navigate 
around the outskirts of an industrial estate, along a series of rundown railway terrace houses, and through various other dodgy 
places that a sane person might not go.
<br><br>
He reached a large park, and walking through that was the longest, albeit most pleasant section of the journey. At the other end, 
he ran across a busy road, and walked through a series of car parks and junctions at Parc Trostre to reach his final destination... 
only to find that his friend had just left. Damn. Not only that, but he could not buy lunch, as he had no money. With nothing else 
to do, he walked all the way back to the train station, and headed home.
<br><br>
Whilst this is quite a sad adventure, it didn't take long for the spark of adventure that &#x2135;<sub>3</sub> and &#x2135;<sub>4</sub> 
had ignited within him to flare up massively. Matthew was eager for more adventure, to steadily further places. When he met up 
with James over Whitson, the direct result was NT βI. Nutty adventures on the train had been born!
