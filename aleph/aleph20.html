  Determined to finally reach the edge of London after it had eluded him on Koppa 4, Matthew set out to do exactly that: a journey to the edge... on foot.
  <br><br>
  Matthew decided he needed a <strong>"short"</strong> walk to clear his head, and so he set off from his flat, and started walking up Chase Road through Park Royal. 
  He walked through the glorious sights of the industrial estate, before turning to cross the enormous bridge to Harlesden, which he usually avoids because Harlesden 
  is shit. Here he watched a cyclist almost off himself by crashing into the kerb, right in front of a lorry.
  <br><br>
  He reached Harlesden, then walked across to Willesden, another area he isn't too keen on. He continued up through Willesden to Willesden Green, then passed under 
  the Jubilee line, and past a potential house for third year in Dollis Hill. Then he decided to walk to the top of Gladstone Park, just like in &#x2135;<sub>10</sub>. 
  <br><br>
  Gladstone Park is really nice - it is a little steep hill that gives lovely views of West London - he could clearly see the cluster of towers in North Acton, including 
  Woodward, where he lived in first year, and Holbrook, where he lived in second year. After admiring the view for a while, he then had a choice to come to. Did he; <br>
  A) Turn back now and walk southwards towards home? <br>
  B) Walk eastwards for a bit towards Hampstead Heath? <br>
  C) Walk westwards for a bit to reach Wembley? <br>
  Or D) Walk northwards and try and reach <i>THE EDGE</i><br>
  A was a sensible option - he had a date to go on later and should therefore head home. B and C were perfectly fine - neither was more than 2-3 miles away and both had 
  decent transport links home. D was nuts - the edge was almost 10 miles away through hilly north London. <br>
  So of course Matthew chose D.<br>
  When Matthew later informed James about this adventure, James foolishly assumed that Matthew had merely taken the train out all the way to the edge, and had had a 
  little jolly at the edge of London to escape the city air. But no, Matthew had walked for hours and miles, through smoggy London air, up and down various hills, in 
  order to have a small amount of time at the edge before heading home at Matthew speed. But more on that later.
  <br><br>
  Matthew's course of action was therefore decided. He plotted a "direct" route north, to avoid the reservoir and enormous motorway junction, and then set off once more.
  He walked through Dollis Hill and Neasden (the latter bit was horrible - it was alongside a very noisy and polluted road), before turning up towards Kingsbury. 
  <br><br>
  At this point, Matthew's intention had been to walk directly up through Kingsbury towards Watling Street, but as soon as he turned onto the correct road, he noticed 
  a turning off in a slightly different direction. "Hmm, that looks like a nice quiet road - much nicer than this one" he thought. "I'll take that one instead", and thus 
  turned up Salmon Street. This was a mistake. Almost immediately the road was clogged with traffic, and the nice wide pavement ended (it was closed due to <i>literally 
  every house on the street having building work done</i>), and Matthew was forced to duck and dive along the grassy verge, trying not to get hit by passing cars. 
  Soon enough, he was fed up of this road, and so decided to turn off before the pavement narrowed again as the road passed through a country park, as he could see the 
  traffic queueing up already. Instead, he decided to turn off and skirt around the park - it looked like a lovely little residential street. It couldn't be worse, nonne?
  <br><br>
  But it was worse. It was a private road, and thus was filled with potholes and had no appreciable pavement. To make matters worse, there were roadworks going on, so 
  all the (considerable traffic) was weaving on and off the almost-nonexistent pavement anyway, making life hell. After cars started ignoring the man with the manual 
  traffic light and almost crashed into one another, causing the man to throw down his sign in disgust and storm off, Matthew started looking for an exit, and soon 
  enough was walking along a desolate street back to the original road that he had rejected, walking down the hill in the knowledge that he'd immenently be walking 
  back up it.
  <br><br>
  Take 2: Now on the correct road, Matthew continued walking up through Kingsbury, and was beginning to make progress again. Then it started to rain. He spent the next 
  few minutes swearing at the evil small-mindedness of the weather, before it eventually cleared up. After this, he continued up through Queensbury (which stretched on 
  forever) before arriving on Watling Street at Burnt Oak.
  <br><br>
  You'll never guess it, but Watling Street (the most famous Roman Road) is straight.
  <br><br>
  He walked along Watling Street all the way to Edgware, which was his intended destination. He turned off, to be greeted by an enormous, ominous and threatening black 
  cloud, then walked to the tube station, the northern line terminus. It was kind of disappointing - it looked much, much better in the Jay Foreman video. The station 
  entrance was reduced to just a side door, so Matthew only had a peep inside, and the bus station reminded him very, very much of PT or Merthyr.
  <br><br>
  Now Matthew had nominally reached his destination - the edge(ware) of a tube line, and basically the edge(ware) of London. But as always, there was almost something 
  else, just a "short" walk away - this time, Stanmore (Note to James: this Stanmore-Edgware trip is a staple of many tube challenges). So Matthew continued up Watling 
  Street to Stanmore. Along the way, he passed a new housing development (Stonegrove and Spur Road, which he found out after many hours of searching), which had street 
  names taken straight from Futurama (presumably) - Farnsworth Drive, Fry Lane and Brannigan Way. Very odd.
  <br><br>
  This time however, Matthew was now on the very edge of London - he could see the greenery on the opposite end of the roundabout, and Stanmore was a mere 2 minutes 
  away. He was finally at the edge of London... almost - there were 1 or 2 houses beyond the roundabout. "Huh, no big deal", Matthew thought to himself, "I'll just 
  walk past them", and so set out climbing Brockley Hill. 
  <br><br>
  <i>Note to self: climbing the 3rd tallest hill in London (tallest in North London) whilst walking along a 12-inch pavement by the side of Watling Street is a bad idea.</i>
  <br><br>
  After a very long walk, he reached the top... and started to descend. If he had come this far, then he was going to make it to the very edge of Greater London! 
  Screw you Koppa 4! After reaching the bottom and crossing over the M1, Matthew finally reached the edge, and had left London!
  <br><br>
  Well that wasn't worth it. How could he tell people where he'd been? He decided to go "just a little further" to Elstree. He ran across the slip roads of 
  a dual carriageway (almost died), then crossed the road again, before climbing a short but enormously steep hill to reach the village centre, and was thoroughly 
  underwhelmed - he'd been to tiny Welsh villages on the HoW line that were bigger! There was literally one shop (where he bought water). But nevertheless, it was 
  quite sweet, having been in the big smoke for so long.
  <br><br>
  Matthew then doubled back, almost being run over again, then reclimbing Brockley Hill, and crossing Watling Street on a blind bend (its first bend since London). 
  The approaching storm cloud loomed ominously over Matthew as he stuck his finger up at the sky and threatened it; <i>dared it</i> to rain on him. Despite that, 
  he decided that the best course of action was to take a detour to the viewpoint at the top of Stanmore Hill, which had beautiful views, before descending the hill 
  to Stanmore station at the end of the Jubilee line, just as the storm hit. Whilst on the train he had the following conversation:
  <br><br>
  <strong>Koppa</strong><br>
  Also, did that adventure you have count as an Aleph? I just need to know because I went on my own Aleph today xD<br>
  <strong>JamesA</strong><br>
  The first hash? Fuck yes. My bus broke down<br>
  <strong>Koppa</strong><br>
  XDD<br>
  Okay, you can have #19, I'll have #20<br>
  Would you like 1 random out of context photo from Aleph 20?<br>
  <strong>JamesA</strong><br>
  Yes<br>
  <strong>Koppa</strong>

<div id="box100"><p>
  Hehe<br>
  <strong>JamesA</strong><br>
  All the way to Hertfordshire!?<br>
  Did you go back to where we failed on K4?<br>
  <strong>Koppa</strong><br>
  Close, but not quite<br>
  <strong>JamesA</strong><br>
  Did you go up the NR line and back down to the border?<br>
  <strong>Koppa</strong><br>
  You will have to find out xD<br>
  <strong>JamesA</strong><br>
  When do I expect Aleph20?<br>
  <strong>Koppa</strong><br>
  I might write it tonight or tomorrow. It is only a very small adventure. If it wasn't so bats, I'd make it a beth<br>
  <strong>JamesA</strong><br>
  Oh god...
  <br><br>
  He then took the Jubilee to Wembley Park, and the Met to Ickenham, before disembarking and walking to West Ruislip in a nod to Koppa 4. Just like in Koppa 4, 
  time was beginning to run out, and so he had to miss out the failed walk to the edge of London (yet again). Then he took the Central line home. In total, he did 
  roughly 16 miles of walking, with the outbound journey to Elstree being 12 miles.
  <br><br> 
  <strong>But that's <i>not</i> all folks!</strong> Matthew then headed back out, into central London. He took the central line to Bank, then changed to the Northern 
  Line, where he had an out-of-body experience: despite heading north, the train announced that it was headed to Morden... in the south. He got onboard, the train 
  doors closed, and the train announced <i>"The next station is London Bridge. This train is terminating at Morden"</i>. <strong><b>Fuck</b></strong>.
  <br><br>
  But sure enough, the train rocked up in Moorgate, and announced as such. The doors shut, and the train announced <i>"The next station is Bank. This 
  train is terminating at Morden"</i>. What the fuck was going on? Why was this happening?
  <br><br>
  He turned up in Old Street: <i>"The next station is Moorgate. This train is terminating at Morden"</i>. This was such a weird backwards experience. Finally, he 
  arrived in Angel, marched up the long escalators, and then marched to Tanakatsu, a lovely katsu restaurant, arriving all of 90 seconds early, a new record for him!
  Freya arrived shortly afterwards, and we had a very nice meal together.
