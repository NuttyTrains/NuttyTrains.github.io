<p> In freshers week, Matthew took the tube to a Japanese teahouse near The Angel, before taking the DLR from Bank to Greenwich 
to see an exibition about the moon. The DLR was like a rollercoaster!
<br><br>
In comparison to other adventures, this is a bit of a washout. After his first ever uni maths lecture (with KBuzz), Matthew took 
his work on the tube with him, and took the district line to Westminster. Here, he changed to the Jubilee line, to give him an 
excuse to see the vast expanses of concrete and steel that make up the colossal atrium of the station (see &#x2135;<sub>11</sub> 
and ϙ1 for further details). He took the Jubilee through the science fiction-themed stations to London Bridge (London Bridge station 
would fit in with the Death Star, and has custom steel panels which say "London Bridge"), and changed to the Northern Line. Yuck. 
(Matthew's hatred of the Northern line is summed up the best on ϙ1 once again).
<br><br>
He took the packed train, via Bank, to Angel, and ascended the longest single escalator on the tube network, to surface in Islington. 
Whilst tempted to run across the A1, to add to his list of "A Roads I have crossed dangerously" with the A4 and A5, he decided against 
it, and headed directly to the tearoom, Katsute 100. It was a lovely little Japanese tearoom, which Matthew would later take Freya 
to. He ordered a Genmaicha tea, which is a steamed sencha tea from Kyoto, with added toasted rice to give it a unique flavour. 
It was served in a beautiful earthenware Japanese teapot, with a ceramic gauze and 2 spouts, and was told he could refill the teapot 
with free hot water for a 2nd and 3rd cup. The tea was completely unique, but very nice, so he did so.
<br><br>
After sitting there, looking into the garden for an hour, going over the lecture content, he left, got back on the northern line, 
and changed at Bank, before descending deep into the abyss, and catching the DLR to Greenwich. He sat on the second row from the 
front, and had a fantastic view of the train climbing the steep and twisted tunnel to the surface, before rocketing along 
rollercoaster-like tracks above East London. The tracks undulated next to each other, for no apparent reason, and twisted and interwove 
into what must have been a knot. The track curved sharply to the right, and we wove in and amongst the skyscrapers of Canary Wharf, 
stopping at its magnificent (albeit very weird) station. The line then plunged underground to cross the river, and I alighted 
on the opposite bank, at Greenwich.
<br><br>
It took me a while to locate the Oyster validator, as I had not been aware that the DLR has mostly no ticket barriers. It then took 
me longer again to weave my way around the university of Greenwich to reach the National Maritime museum, to visit the Moon Exhibition 
(which I don't have the slightest clue as to why it was in a naval museum). Despite the steep ticket prices, I enjoyed.
<br><br>
I walked up the hill to the Royal Observatory, and admired the views of London. I then stood with one foot in either hemisphere! 
I had previously stood, in Iceland, with one foot in America and one in Europe, so this was a nice partner to that event. I then 
headed back down and returned to the DLR.
<br><br>
This time, I wormed my way to the front of the train, and filmed much of the (unfortunately, less exciting) journey home. I'd upload 
the video, but my camera skills leave something to be desired, and the video quality is shockingly awful. We descended back into 
the deep tunnel at Bank, where I caught the Central line home, after a fun day out.
