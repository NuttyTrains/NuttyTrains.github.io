<p> 2 weeks into term, Matthew went on a very long Tube journey to Chesham, at the very end of the Metropolitan line. He saw many 
ducks. Again, a very lacklustre adventure compared to some of the others, but the distances involved are impressive.
<br><br>
On the second Friday of term, Matthew caught the Victoria line and changed to the Jubilee at Green Park. He then headed north, all 
the way to Dollis Hill (a zone 3 station, to allow him to maximise use of his travelcard). He alighted and went for a walk towards the 
hill, which was a lovely park (Gladstone Park), passing beautful Edwardian terraces on the way. He climbed the hill, admiring the 
views of London it afforded, and headed up to the ruined house at the summit. He bought himself a tea, and sat on a bench for a while 
before heading back down.
<br><br>
He then boarded the Jubilee, changed at Wembley Park to an Uxbridge-bound Met train. At Harrow-on-the-Hill, he changed to a Watford-bound 
Met train, and at Moor Park, he changed once more to a Chesham-bound Met train. After Moor Park, the miles and miles of leafy Metroland 
suburbia gave way to pockets of woodland between villages, before crossing the M25 and arriving in pure countryside. Even though 
he'd only been in London for 2 weeks, it felt like ages since he'd seen any countryside, and he was incredibly glad to see the forest 
once more. The line split after Chalfont and Latimer, and the single Chesham track curved gracefully along the pristine valley leading 
to the town. It was so strange being on a tube train in the middle of the countryside!
<br><br>
The train pulled into the station, which was filled with sweet flower beds and little gnomes. It even had a signal box. I left the 
station and headed into the small, quiet town centre. I saw the town clock, visited Waterstones and Sainsburys (where I stocked up 
with a huge amount of snacks, enough to scare me into recording all future purchases in a spreadsheet), and crossed the river to 
see the quaint half-timbered houses, the churchyard and the park. The greenery and serenity reminded me of a less rubbish version 
of home.
<br><br>
As rush hour dawned ever closer, I got back on the train, and headed to London. There, I changed at Harrow-on-the-Hill to an 
Uxbridge-bound Met train, which, as predicted, was packed. Luckily, at Rayners Lane, I changed once more to an eastbound Piccadilly 
train, which was silent. I went south through various quiet stations, including Sudbury Town, as I watched the sun set. I then 
alighted at North Ealing, which also looks like a quaint village halt, and walked through Ealing's Hanger Hill and Japanese 
neighbourhoods to West Acton on the central line, to head home. I enjoyed that last change so much that I sometimes go home from 
college by taking the Piccadilly to North Ealing, walking to West Acton, and taking the Central line home, just because of how serene 
the walk is.
