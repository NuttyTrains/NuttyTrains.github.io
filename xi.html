    These adventures are going to be very painful and will doubtless end up as a mistake :). These adventures are currently based around Oxford and will stretch either 
    to Gloucester or to Cambridge. Not sure which one yet. Cue pain, depression, pain, more depression and a side order of pain.

    This isn't tourism, it is masochism. Sweet, sweet sadomasochism. Now that James has decided to <i>live</i> in the Bad Place, it was time for a painful adventure around the 
    Oxford triangle!
    <br><br>
    Matthew caught his vey nice cheap train up to Oxford early in the morning, making a sub-1 minute connection in Notting Hill Gate to just make it in time. He arrived in 
    Oxford and to his surprise bumped into James who had been walking to meet him. We headed to Cafe Nero and Matthew pulled out his laptop to take care of some work whilst 
    James headed back to Teddy Hall to have a meeting and tutor his gullible <s>money-tree</s> student.
    <br><br>
    Before long, James returned after conning his <s>money-tree</s> out of a lesson, and we headed back to James's room, last redecorated in the 80s, in Teddy Hall, passing 
    a group of students trashing each other on the way. 
    <br><br>
    We saw his room and mirror and then headed out to the trains. Missed the train, so wandered up the Oxford Canal, filmed some stuff, wandered through Jericho and headed 
    to Gloucester Green Market (bought cherries), then dropped the fruit off at Teddy Hall and actually went to the trains. Caught the train up to Banbury, jumping on and 
    off, did a tiny loop of the edge of the town centre, then returned to the station and caught a very nice train to Bicester North, which was delayed, so we missed our 
    connection. Instead, we wandered through Bicester Town centre and headed out to Bicester Village, where we filmed some clips in a multi-storey car park. We caught the 
    train, missed Islip and returned to Oxford. We went to Banana Tree and had Pad Thai and Beef Noodles, got screwed over on the service charge, and then picked up 
    Matthew's stuff at Teddy Hall and got back on the (long) train home, whilst James went drinking in Oxford.
