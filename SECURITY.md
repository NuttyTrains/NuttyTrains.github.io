# Security Policy

I just saw this on "list of files I haven't created", so I thought it would be funny to write one. Here is the NT security policy:

1) Keep secure

## Supported Versions

There is only one China
I mean, there is only one version of the website (apart from the dodgy old forks that we each have one of).
If you have a different version, then go home, yer drunk!

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If something is wrong, fucking fix it. 
Keep edit warring with yourself until it kind-of, maybe works on alternating Tuesdays.
If that fails, report it as an issue
All issues must be include in the description "Sir, can I have some help, pwease?"
