<p>
The chock had just about affected our plans during Koppa 2, but would come to dominate our lives through 2020. We attempted to keep 
<a href="ChockDiary/chock.html">a diary</a> in the earliest days of pre-lockdown in late March, but this failed comically (as per usual).
<br><br>
 Thanks to The Chock<sup>TM</sup>, our 2020 plans were pretty much ruined... or were they? Even though we were unable to go on any adventures after ϙ2 due to 
BBB's first lockdown (shocking, I know), as lockdown relaxed, trains were still reserved for essential journeys only, and S Wales - Cornwall or vice versa isn't 
quite an essential journey - we'd either get nicked or get chocked if we had tried to meet up, being in different parts of the country. So we decided to come up with 
a plan... well, Matthew did, at 2am, on a walk. Now that local, non-public-transport travel is once again permitted, he decided to try and visit our local stations 
(at a social distance) <i>without</i> using trains, thereby creating a new type of NT goal: ¬stations! As ever, here are the rules:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> To flatten the curve we must:
	<ul> 
	  <li> Stay at Home </li>
	  <li> Protect the NHS </li>
	  <li> Save Lives </li>
	  <li> Or alternatively, just take logs of both sides - that'll probably work </li>
	</ul>
     </li>
      <li> To ¬visit a station we must:
	<ul> 
    <li> Get to, and leave the station <i>without</i> using trains </li>
	  <li> Approach the station at a social distance </li>
	  <li> Look around furtively, making sure to appear suspicious </li>
	  <li> Take a shitty photo of the station </li>
	  <li> Attempt to upload said shitty photo to Twitter </li>
	  <li> Have Twitter reject the shitty photo </li>
	  <li> Try again, and upload crappy screenshot of the shitty photo to Twitter </li>
	  <li> Get ¬chocked </li>
	</ul>
     </li>
    </ol>

<p id="ChockNo">We have visited 59 ¬Stations</p>

    <button onclick="ChockMore()" id="ChockMoreBtn">Show Chock Station List</button>
    <span id="chockmore">
     </span>
     <br><br>

     <p>
       After a stroke of luck though, James was able to come up to Wales in early July, so 2020 wasn't a complete waste. We managed to get 7 adventures done in the 
       summer, and these were some of our best yet, even though we had greatly toned down the trains aspect and focused more on the destinations. 
       <a href="r0.html">Here</a> is the real list of our adventures that summer, and <a href="r0.html">here</a> is an... <strong>improved</strong> list.
