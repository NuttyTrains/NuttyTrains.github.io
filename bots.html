    <h1 class= "spacing"> Welcome to Nutty Trains! </h1>
    <div class="intro">
    <p> Ever since firing up our NT Twitter account on Xmas Eve 2019, twitter bots have formed the core of the account, to the point that most people believe the account to be a 
      bot account. From only a few hours in, bots formed the majority of our tweets, and our original 2 bots kept the account going strong from 2019 all the way into the start of 
      the pandemic in March. However, thanks to Covid/Chock, after Koppa 2, Nutty Trains was forced to become Nutty ¬Trains for many months, and was forced again to become Nutty 
      ¬Trains again for many months after Koppa 3. So like everyone else, we had to shift our stuff online. Except, because this is NT, we did this in a... unique way. Our 2 bots 
      were joined by a 3rd towards the end of the 1st lockdown, to everyone's great amusement. But as our R0 adventures went ahead, the bots went silent after an attempted hacking 
      attempt. It was only in the run up to Koppa 3, when James introduced Matthew to twit, Heroku and the cmd that the bot revolution really began... and quickly got completely 
      out of hand! We egged each other on, with increasingly awful bots of all shapes and increasing size, all in the pursuit of divine nuttiness. 3 bots became n, as I have now 
      lost count, old bots were revamped to become even worse than before, and titans such as DrFosterII, TrumpBot, SongBot, the UwUs and NuttyFake were born. This page will 
      be dedicated to these bastions of nuttiness as they evolve over time, so that their greatness can be preserved for all posterity, right alongside the adventures that they 
      were meant to tweet about... instead of fake covid models, songs about politicians or Hashmas, fake Trump quotes, Kernow facts and Express headlines, various vile UwU 
      abominations, or even fake NT tweets, put through a blender and vomited out 100 times a day. Welcome to !botland! </p>

           <td> NTTimeBot was our very first twitter bot, created between Koppa 1 and Koppa 2 by James, to count down the number of days until Koppa 2. It took James 
            ages to crack the Twitter API (which is, and remains, very poorly documented), but he eventually got a functioning bot and was able to tweet using NTTimeBot. 
            After this he set about copying Matthew's countdown.js from this website, in order to count down to Koppa 2. <br>
            After Koppa 2, NTTimeBot was mostly dormant through Chock and the summer, until Matthew updated it for Koppa 3. Since then, it has become Matthew's best friend, 
            and he seems to update it on a near-weekly basis, giving it new things to countdown to, whether that is the next adventure, the presidential election, or the 
            end of lockdown. NTTimeBot was coded to tweet every half hour in the lead-up to Digamma 1, and then refused to die, despite being killed in at least 3 different 
            ways, which is ever so slightly worrying. <br>
            It is still running as of July 2021 (now on Replit), and is the valuable cornerstone of the NT Twitter Armada. NTTimeBot was the home of the ChockClock for many 
            months - RIP </td>

            station table on this website. As it tweeted the same information every day, it was eventually turned off somewhere in the early phases of Chock. <br>
            In Autumn 2020, Matthew replaced NTStationBot with NTElectricBoogaloo, which assumed its original function. He then instead fed NTStationBot our full list 
            of stations, and since then, it has tweeted out a random station from a previous adventure. In December, he upgraded it further, and now it also tweets out 
            a photo from a previous adventure every weekend. Thanks to StationBot, we landed ourselves a newspaper article! </td>

            twitter account was hacked and we had to turn him off in August. <br>
            Matthew later rewrote DrFoster into DrFosterII, completing the rhyme, adding new politicians and new places, and even new rhymes. DrFosterII for some reason 
            has a burning hatred of Kier Starmer. <br>
            And at long last, Dr Foster has made it to Replit. He hurt his cock and caught the chock, and will never go to heroku again!</td>

            But that was only the start of UwU1's glorious career. We then started to write horrible UwUfied responses to burn people's eyes, and we unleashed the bot 
            upon our own account, as we wrote more and more increasingly bad tweets. We turned our beefed-up bot on another anti-lockdown account that had dared reply 
            to us, a few months later, and the bot has only become worse since. Woe betide the fool that interferes with NT now! </td>

            (evil), so Matthew attempted to build in plenty of safeguards that mostly resulted in the bot crashing. After we ran out of free dyno hours for December, 
            !bot was run from the NT server and from Matthew's computer, before quietly being retired as new bots came online. !bot was the last of its generation, as

            SongBot was meant to self-destruct after Boxing Day, but then resurrected itself in January 2021 and took quite an effort to kill off. <br> Matthew's friends

            extra-nutty meta-NT. NuttyFake was born. First, Matthew had to learn to scrape our account for all existing tweets, filtering out tweets with URLs and @s, 
            before dumping them in a massive food file for the bot. This was then fed through js-markov to tweet at high frequency, and was a source of endless amusement 
            to us. Matthew built a parallel bot to tweet out fake tweets from James's account as well. The heart of the bot, however, was append3.js, a bot that continually 
            scraped the account for new tweets, chopping out the unsuitable bits and filtering out the unsuitable tweets, before adding them to the food file. As heroku is 
            useless, it refused to run append3.js, so we were forced to run append3.js from Matthew's computer for months. <br>
            Eventually though, after many months, we improved append3.js, and append5.js was born, finally allowing us to scrape tweets with images (the best tweets). 
            Then we rolled everything into index.js and uploaded it to repl.it, so that it can run 24/7, and not just when Matthew remembers. </td>

            very hard to do on the tube, when we were underground, so he proposed that he could get a Twitter Bot to do this. Whilst TweetyBoi cannot yet do tube trains, 
            during Digamma 1, it finally kind of mastered NR trains and tweeted out all the stations on our respective journeys to and from Taunton and Brizzle... with only 
            a few dozen mistakes. TweetyBoi is commanded via Discord, but can very easily get confused, tweeting out the stations too fast, tweeting out the same station 
            multiple times, tweeting the stations backwards, or just plain wrong, and sometimes it refuses to tweet full stop. It is for this reason that TweetyBoi spends 
            most of his time singing Borat's Jew song in The Bin, <i>where bad bots go to die</i>. <br>
