    <h1 class= "spacing"> Welcome to Nutty Trains! </h1>
    <p> Ever since firing up our NT Twitter account on Xmas Eve 2019, twitter bots have formed the core of the account, to the point that most people believe the account to be a 
      bot account. From only a few hours in, bots formed the majority of our tweets, and our original 2 bots kept the account going strong from 2019 all the way into the start of 
      the pandemic in March. However, thanks to Covid/Chock, after Koppa 2, Nutty Trains was forced to become Nutty ¬Trains for many months, and was forced again to become Nutty 
      ¬Trains again for many months after Koppa 3. So like everyone else, we had to shift our stuff online. Except, because this is NT, we did this in a... unique way. Our 2 bots 
      were joined by a 3rd towards the end of the 1st lockdown, to everyone's great amusement. But as our R0 adventures went ahead, the bots went silent after an attempted hacking 
      attempt. It was only in the run up to Koppa 3, when James introduced Matthew to twit, Heroku and the cmd that the bot revolution really began... and quickly got completely 
      out of hand! We egged each other on, with increasingly awful bots of all shapes and increasing size, all in the pursuit of divine nuttiness. 3 bots became n, as I have now 
      lost count, old bots were revamped to become even worse than before, and titans such as DrFosterII, TrumpBot, SongBot, the UwUs and NuttyFake were born. This page will 
      be dedicated to these bastions of nuttiness as they evolve over time, so that their greatness can be preserved for all posterity, right alongside the adventures that they 
      were meant to tweet about... instead of fake covid models, songs about politicians or Hashmas, fake Trump quotes, Kernow facts and Express headlines, various vile UwU 
      abominations, or even fake NT tweets, put through a blender and vomited out 100 times a day. Welcome to !botland! </p>
