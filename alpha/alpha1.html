	Back in December 2015, a joint Business Studies & Latin school trip was organised to Bath, for the Latin students 
    to visit the Roman baths, and for the Business students to study the Christmas market. Both groups would then be given 
	time to explore the city (including Matthew visiting a 5* Indian Restaurant in a dodgy alleyway), before heading home. 
	However, the real highlight of the trip were the train journeys there and back. 
    <br><br>
    The group met at Swansea train station on that cold December morning, and James was especially excited to be 
	travelling on his first train, even though he was still a bus addict at the time. Experiencing a GWR HST from Swansea 
	to Newport was the first step to converting him though! We then changed to a 3-car GWR DMU, which had been fully 
	reserved, forcing everyone to stand in the corridor all the way to Bath. Along the way, one of our classmates (Jake) nearly 
	got decapitated by a passing train whilst sticking his head out of the window. This was going to be a fun trip.

	The Roman baths were optime according to Matthew, whilst James enjoyed the Christmas Market very much. Matthew later 
	went to the Eastern Eye - a 5* Indian restaurant in a dodgy alleyway, before wandering aimlessly around the city 
	centre. James also wandered around aimlessly, but omitted the restaurant bit. James was able to explore the shopping 
	centre (this later became a running theme in NT adventures), whilst Matthew managed to stumble upon Pulteney Bridge, 
	and watched a different classmate (Scott) throw himself onto the road in front of a moving bus to retrieve his rugby 
	ball. Despite later adventures consisting of just Matthew and James, we strive to uphold this level of nuttiness and 
	risk our lives as frequently in all our adventures.

	The journey back was less eventful, as night drew in. Once again, we changed at Newport onto a HST, and headed back to 
	Swansea (Matthew alighting at Neath). This adventure was the earliest precursor to our NT adventures, but it was also 
	an important component of the foundation of our friendship.

	Whilst the below video is not actually from Alpha 1, it is from only about 2 weeks after, so it is close enough.
