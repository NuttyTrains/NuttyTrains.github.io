	1 year later, and after the success of the Bath trip, a follow-up school trip was planned, this time just for Latin 
	students, to the British Museum in London. Firstly, we had to arrive even earlier at Swansea station, to catch a GWR 
	HST all the way to Paddington. Matthew turned up in his tweed jacket, assuming that this trip would include a trip to 
	a fancy restaurant like the last one, but this didn't happen. The only result was that he looked sorely out of place! 
	<br><br>
	This was still one of James's first times on a train, as was the case for Matthew. The journey was uneventful, and 3 
	hours later we arrived in Paddington, where James was absolutely gobsmacked by the size of the station. They don't make 
	stations like that in Cornwall!
	<br><br>
	We then got on the Circle-District line at Paddington, and went 2 stops south to Notting Hill Gate. These are the first 
	stations to appear on our list of stations, as they were the first ones that we considered to be "ticked off" in line 
	with some system of rules. We then changed to the Central line (which is <em>really</em> far underground at Notting Hill 
	Gate), and journeyed to Tottenham Court Road. We then walked to the British Museum.
	<br><br>
	When we arrived in the museum, we were shocked by the scale of it too - it was vast! We then spent numerous hours 
	looking around the Roman Britain exhibition in the museum. We were then granted 2 hours to ourselves to explore the 
	museum, which we spent in the oriental pottery + chinaware section. As it grew dark, we caught a bus back towards 
	Paddington, as the tube was immensely crowded due to rush-hour. We saw the congestion on Oxford Street due to Christmas 
	shoppers.
	<br><br>
	We arrived back in Paddington to catch the GWR HST home. There was initially some resistance due to some of our reserved 
	seats being occupied, but after Reading, it was a very uneventful journey home. Matthew alighted at Neath, and James at 
	Swansea. It was this adventure more than anything else that converted James to love trains and formed the inspiration 
	for the Î² series of NT adventures.
