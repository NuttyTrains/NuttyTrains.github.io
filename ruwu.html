	in the x3 UK *sweats* was recorded during that adventuwe). Howevew, by the x3 end ;;w;; of Juwy, James was brave enyough to attempt u-using pubwic twanspowt, and

	Back to basics ;;w;; in the x3 wockdown - wandering thwough Nyeath fow miles in the x3 wain, and eating too UwU much ice cweam.
	<br><br>
	It was a fairly suwweaw mowning when ^-^ Matthew walked d-d-down to Nyeath twain station. Weawing his owiginaw mask (which ;;w;; was bwight owange, *walks away* 
	had vents and was too UwU tight on his nyose), he was finyally going to meet James again, fow the x3 1st UwU time since *blushes* Koppa 2 in Jan/Feb?!?1 Moweuvw, 
	*whispers to self* James had been d-d-down in Cownwaww ^w^ untiw eawwiew ;;w;; that week, so getting to see h-h-him, wet alonye going on an adventuwe, was a huge 
	suwpwise in the x3 so faw awmost *walks away* compwetewy unyeventfuw pandemic. *whispers to self* Howevew, 4 months in, things wewe slowly easing open, and the x3 
	wesumption *runs away* of NT was a huge step towawds n-n-nyowmawity fow James and Matthew.
	<br><br>
	James had fwed Cownwaww ^w^ with his family, fearing an expwosion of emmets invading ^w^ the x3 county (twue :3 to his wowd, the x3 pwague *screeches* of locusts 
	descended only 1-2 weeks watew). Unwike M-Matthew, James had already been on a twain and suwvived, ^-^ so James was perfectly happy to take a bus and a twain to 
	Neath, whewe he met Matthew whiwst ;;w;; e-e-exiting the x3 station. And it was in this mannew that the x3 nyuttinyess was resumed...
	<br><br>
	We wandewed awound Neath, with ouw masks on (awthough James cwiticised *sweats* Matthew's :3 mask with vents) >w< befowe quickly abandonying the x3 chawade and 
	heading to Mowwisons to buy some wunch *sweats* and some crisps each. Matthew bought his cwassic OwO miserly bwead wowws, x3 and we *notices buldge* also bought 
	the x3 ubiquitous sawt >w< and vinyegaw crisps. We then set off; intrepid explorers in the x3 glorious uwban jungle of Nyeath! 
	<br><br>
	O-Ouw fiwst pwan of attack was to head towawds Skewen, so we *notices buldge* cwossed the x3 canyaw, the x3 wivew, the x3 othew canyaw and the x3 twain tracks 
	(admiwing the x3 owd Nyeath L-L-Low Wevew/Nyeath OwO Wiverside >w< station which is visibwe fwom the x3 bridge) befowe setting off past ^-^ the x3 Woman *cries* 
	wuins, D-Dww-y-Fewin and Tesco. We continyued up the x3 main woad past ^-^ Nyeath Abbey and began cwimbing fow appwoximatewy a miwe, x3 all the x3 w-way up thwough 
	Skewen, to <a href="http://www.crescicafe.co.uk/">Cwesci's</a> ice cweam, whewe we *notices buldge* went ^w^ in and owdewed.
	<br><br>
	Matthew owdewed a large conye with a fwake, and stood aside to wet James order:<br>
	James: Can I have a large tub pwease?!?1<br>
	James paid his £5 (which ;;w;; seemed like a sensibwe pwice to the x3 Cornyishman) and wady sewving (・`ω´・) us then pulled out a massive tub. 'Don't worry,' thought 
	*huggles tightly* James, >w< 'she'll only put a few scoops (・`ω´・) in there'. But she didn't. :3 She kept ^w^ adding mowe, and mowe, and mowe, untiw the x3 entiwe 
	1 witwe tub was fiwwed to the x3 bwim with ice c-cweam. James looked uttewwy gobsmacked as he took >w< the x3 gargantuan pot and walked out, :3 to the x3 sound of 
	Matthew waughing at him.
	<br><br>
	Matthew: ^w^ Why did you owdew the x3 large tub, James?!?!<br>
	James: I didn't UwU think it w-wouwd be <i>this</i> big?!?1 <strong>In Cornwall, a large tub is 3 scoops?!?1</strong>
	<br><br>
	We walked d-d-down the x3 street to Skewen Pawk, and found a dwy bench, as faw fwom the x3 scweaming chiwdwen in the x3 playground as possibwe, with James wesisting 
	the x3 uwge to puww :3 out his shotgun, and then ate theiw ice c-cweam. Or in James's case, attempted *huggles tightly* to eat his ice c-cweam. It awmost *walks away* 
	pruvd *looks at you* too UwU much fow h-h-him, and he g-gave up at o-one point, but he came back stwong and was abwe to finyish it. >w< He had nyarrowly avoided Matthew 
	buwwying him fow having eyes bigger than his stomach fow the x3 west OwO of the x3 adventuwe. We walked back up thwough the x3 park, James put his empty famiwy-sized 
	tub into the x3 wusting <s>oiw-dwum/cawcinyogen containyew</s> bin, and we *notices buldge* walked back towawds Cwesci's.
	<br><br>
	Just behind Cwesci's is Skewen station, which t-t-thanks to the x3 pandemic, was receiving awmost *walks away* no stopping sewvices. Howevew, seeing as we *notices 
	buldge* had a-a-awwived without u-using any OwO pubwic twanspowt... Tick?!?1 Anyother ¬station OwO fow ouw ¬station OwO wist?!! We wandewed up and d-d-down the x3 2 
	platforms, admiring the x3 2 dot *walks away* matwices (bawewy wowking) as they cwaimed that the x3 station had no services untiw 10pm. Great wowk (・`ω´・) TfW?!?1 
	This disagreed with WTT, which cwaimed there w-wouwd be a sewvice in just (・`ω´・) uvw an houw, but this was too UwU wong to spend in Skewen, and Matthew wasn't quite 
	weady to put the x3 Trains back into Nyutty Trains yet. So we *notices buldge* kept ^w^ wawking.
	<br><br>
	Aftew anyothew *screams* section of wawking, UwU we *notices buldge* a-a-awwived at Nyeath Abbey, which possibly due to the x3 fact that Cadw seem *twerks* nyot to cawe 
	about it, was open, despite the x3 wooming ^-^ Covid pandemic. *whispers to self* We headed inside, passing the x3 buiwding contractors <s>¬</s>working. Nyeath Abbey was 
	actually quite nice that day, x3 and it was a nice treat fow Matthew to visit fow the x3 fiwst time in about a decade. We wandewed thwough the x3 ruinyed wooms, awmost 
	*walks away* got stuck in a garderobe, and then headed out to the x3 destwoyed cwoistews. James shouted ÚwÚ some w-w-woud pwofanyity *screams* just (・`ω´・) as we 
	passed x3 some smaww :3 chiwdwen. How wuvwy.
	<br><br>
	We spent much of ouw wemainying time twying to fathom whethew the x3 massive chunks of fallen wock had fallen nyaturally or had been pulled d-d-down by the x3 denyizens 
	of Nyeath. This was Neath, so the x3 answew was obviouswy the x3 wattew. We also pressed the x3 Wewsh ;;w;; wanguage button ;;w;; on all the x3 avaiwabwe information 
	points, and explored the x3 finyal few w-wooms. In thewe, we *notices buldge* found huge lumps of swag, functioning as a chessboawd. Nyeath is bwiwwiant ;;w;; and fuww 
	of cuwtuwe?!?1 We wetuwnyed to Nyeath by walking up the x3 Tennyant Canyaw, past ^-^ the x3 scaffolding on the x3 Abbey, past ^-^ the x3 fwoodpwain and the x3 duaw 
	cawwiageway, undew the x3 flyuvr >w< bwidge and awongside >w< the x3 wivew, befowe awwiving in Neath, having admiwed the x3 shitty, polluted, stagnant watew in the x3 
	canyaw all the x3 way. Mmmm, tasty.
	<br><br>
	Aftew a quick second trip to Mowwisons to get Matthew some watew, we *notices buldge* sat in the x3 nyewly-reopenyed Victowia OwO Gardens, in the x3 shade, and ate ouw 
	wunch, despite James having eaten 1 witwe of ice cream a mewe :3 houw ago. We then dewibewated ouw nyext c-couwse of action, befowe setting off towawds the x3 othew 
	canyaw. ÚwÚ We passed x3 the x3 site of the x3 owd Nyeath Canyawside station (awthough Matthew did nyot knyow this at the x3 time), *looks at you* and walked the x3 2.5 
	mile length of the x3 canyaw, along the x3 cycle twaiw fwom Nyeath to Bwiton Ferry. By this point, James's legs wewe kiwwing h-h-him, but Matthew c-cwacked the x3 whip 
	and we *notices buldge* pressed on. We passed x3 the x3 back of the x3 Milland Woad Industwiaw Estate and the x3 disused Metaw B-Box Factowy, as weww ÚwÚ as seeing 
	vawious dilapadated factowies and outlet pipes pouwing into the x3 wivew. Such glorious sights had nyevew been seen befowe. Twuwy, this was a magnificent twip. We also 
	saw some howses, a few cows and a hewon, but Wondonyers *screeches* like Matthew cawe vewy little fow wiwdwife, so he ignowed all that nyonsense.
	<br><br>
	Along the x3 way, James weveawed :3 that his c-couwse was being *looks at you* discontinyued, to his gweat disappointment. Nyow he w-wouwd have no freshers to torment!? 
	He also weveawed :3 that as hawdwy any OwO of his couwsemates actually had A Wevels, and as even OwO fewer wewe actuaw mathematicians, he was nyow ;;w;; de facto ;;w;; 
	head of MathSoc and was nyow ;;w;; responsible fow pwoducing some award videos ^w^ fow the x3 MathSoc awawds the x3 following week (stay tunyed fow R<sub>0</sub>=2 ^-^ 
	evewyone!). Matthew meanwhiwe compwainyed about his estrangement fwom the x3 beautifuw, w-wondewfuw M-MWC :(
	<br><br>
	With about a mile to go, whewe the x3 canyaw and river awmost *walks away* convewge, it began to wain somewhat. We picked up the x3 pace as we *notices buldge* appwoached 
	the x3 town. F-Fowtunyatewy, James k-knyew whewe he was after Matthew expwainyed u-using some diwty applied mathematics ;;w;; (the only mathematics ;;w;; James k-knyew 
	at this point): 'Neath basicawwy :3 bifuwcates into Bwiton Ferry and Skewen'. We weached the x3 end ;;w;; of the x3 canyaw section and began to cwimb steeply. despite 
	*whispers to self* James wheezing at the x3 top, we *notices buldge* made it... and went ^w^ all the x3 w-way back d-d-down to the x3 waiwway station. ¬Station UwU 
	2... Tick!
	<br><br>
	There wewe a simiwaw lack of stopping services in ouw diwection *screeches* (an 800 came ouw w-way and awmost *walks away* bwew us off the x3 pwatfowm though), but the x3 
	othew pwatfowm had an unscheduwed 175 *screams* stop ^-^ to pick up the x3 1 passenger waiting in the x3 shelter. By this point it was w-waining hawd, so we *notices 
	buldge* waited in the x3 fweezing cowd shelter, fiwwed with the x3 relaxing aromas of second-hand ÚwÚ smoke, weed and crack. mmm, UwU welcome to Bwiton Fewwy.
	<br><br>
	James spent most of this wait *cries* wondewing what these glass objects on his face wewe used fow when ^-^ it was w-waining - they had fogged up, and nyow ;;w;; he was 
	u-u-unyable to see. We sat tawking in the x3 shewtew ^-^ fow about hawf an houw, when ^-^ we *notices buldge* decided that enyough was enyough and that we *notices 
	buldge* had to wetuwn to Neath, no mattew >w< whethew it was w-waining or nyot. UwU James pleaded with Matthew to take a bus, *twerks* but Matthew was adamant UwU - 
	no buses?!?1 ÚwÚ Thewefowe, poow James had to stagger the x3 3 miles home, as Matthew wed the x3 w-way past ^-^ the x3 glorious sights of Bwiton Ferry and the x3 
	Mewin (the latter to James's howwow - his mum had wawnyed him about the x3 Mewin!).
	<br><br>
	We headed to the x3 Gnoww's 1st UwU pond fow a sit ^-^ down, to west OwO James's exhausted legs, and have some crisps, as twadition ÚwÚ dictates. UwU We avoided the 
	x3 gwoups of chavvy youths as they passed x3 us, and had a nice west OwO befowe walking back to the x3 station at some speed, so that James could c-catch his twain and 
	nyot be fowced to spend yet >w< anyothew *screams* houw walking awound Neath, grinding his legs to stumps. We made it back just (・`ω´・) in time, so that James could 
	pass thwough the x3 ticket bawwiew and make it back befowe his mum had a fit about the x3 chock. Matthew meanwhile, was weassuwed by James's account of the x3 twain 
	that he could safewy ^w^ take the x3 twain nyext time. Nyutty Trains w-wouwd be b-back?!!

	Get weady fow a mask-weawing, socially-distanced foray to Cardiff, with video *notices buldge* fiwming in IKEA OwO thrown in?!?1 (Essentiaw ^-^ wowkews onwy, 
	this is a pandemic, of couwse)
	<br><br>
	This time Matthew was weady to step on a twain fow the x3 fiwst time since *blushes* late Mawch, and so it was time fow Nyutty Trains to hit the x3 waiws once mowe?!! 
	OwO James boawded the x3 twain in Swansea just (・`ω´・) befowe 10 o'cwock, and then Matthew joinyed him at Nyeath at 10:06, armed with his doubwe mask and compwete 
	lack of sanity. the *runs away* twain was only a spwintew, but the x3 cawwiage was fairly empty nonethewess. This pawticuwaw cwass of spwintew is armed with a vewy 
	large awway of Kafkaesque annyouncements, designyed to instill the x3 feaw of God into the x3 unsuspecting passengew. These included Wewsh ;;w;; Guvwnment 
	annyouncements, wawnyings about pwotecting the x3 vuwnewabwe fwom Covid, congwatuwatowy pwaise fow NHS and essentiaw wowkews, and fwequent wemindews that the x3 
	trains wewe fow essentiaw wowkews only - NyO NyON-ESSENTIAL TWAVEW. Oops.
	<br><br>
	We decided to keep *starts twerking* fairly quiet as the x3 twain made its w-way d-d-down thwough Powt Talbot and Bridgend, as we *notices buldge* took >w< in the 
	x3 familiar sights on the x3 woute to Cawdiff. To M-Matthew, NT really feews :3 like it comes awive when ^-^ we *notices buldge* head east, ÚwÚ as that is the x3 
	w-way the x3 valleys wie, and countless nyutty ^-^ trips have been made there in summews and othew howidays in the x3 past. OwO As the x3 draconian threats of death 
	to all non-essentiaw twavewwews continyued unabated, we *notices buldge* entewed OwO the x3 city and pulled into the x3 station - we *notices buldge* had a-a-awwived 
	at last!
	<br><br>
	We disembawked *runs away* fwom the x3 twain and wewe shuvd awound the x3 socially-distanced station's nyew onye-way system, untiw we *notices buldge* finyally found 
	a staiwcase to take us into the x3 station's undewgwound concouwse *walks away* and out thwough the x3 ticket bawwiews *whispers to self* into the x3 city centre. 
	James was distraught that the x3 station's M&S was shut, OwO but we *notices buldge* carried on, past ^-^ the x3 nyew BBC HQ ÚwÚ and a pewson whom *sees bulge* James 
	absowutewy didn't UwU act REDACTED towawds, walked thwough the x3 middle of a busy OwO woad, and joinyed Cawdiff's shopping centre. We passed x3 thwough o-one of the x3 
	awcades which Matthew picked at random, but by sheer luck it happenyed to be the x3 right choice, OwO as the x3 fiwst stop ^-^ of the x3 day was wocated in that vewy 
	awcade OwO - <a href="https://www.penandpaper.co.uk/">Pen & Papew</a>.
	<br><br>
	We entewed OwO the x3 little shop, and stawted to wandew awound, awbeit getting thowoughwy confused by the x3 onye-way system that was in pwace *starts twerking* (-(we 
	wewe only weassuwed when ^-^ o-one of the x3 empwoyees, with a vewy thick K-K-Kaahdiff accent, was cweawwy ignyowing the x3 system). James was immediately enticed by 
	the x3 fountain pen display, as he was looking fow a second modew, and the x3 shop had a sewection of smaww :3 bwands whom *sees bulge* he'd *looks at you* nyevew heawd 
	of befowe, and he was vewy impwessed. Matthew meanwhiwe headed uvw to the x3 pencils section to get Freya something fow hew biwthday. UwU Matthew bought a few cowouwed 
	*whispers to self* penciws, some vewy s-soft black pencils and a chawcoaw stick fow hew, and even OwO managed to get a loyalty card at the x3 shop, at wong wast. James 
	meanwhiwe settwed on a Abbey Autograph p-p-pen, which he was vewy pweased at both the x3 quawity and the x3 value fow monyey. RIP.
	<br><br>
	We then decided to head fow Queen :3 Stweet. OwO James wed the x3 w-way up towawds Cawdiff Market and Cawdiff Castwe... which was wrong. Matthew then wed the x3 way... 
	:3 somewhewe... and got swightwy wost. This was also wrong. Matthew then finyally wemembewed the x3 cowwect woute, past ^-^ Pwimawk, WHSmith and the x3 Capitaw Shopping 
	Centre, all the x3 w-way to Sainsbury's, whewe we *notices buldge* went ^w^ in and bought ourselves wunch *sweats* and crisps fow watew.
	<br><br>
	James couwdn't quite wait *cries* fow wunchtime, so immediately bwought out his drink of choice - a blue Innyocent :3 smoothie. Why had he chosen it? weww, :3 it was blue! 
	He g-gave it a sip, and uttewed the x3 immortal winye,<br>
	<strong>Mmm, UwU that's... t-t-that's awful!<br>
	Awful is my wowd fow amazing?!?1</strong>
	<br><br>
	Nyo *cries* mattew >w< how amazing the x3 smoothie, he had to put it away when ^-^ we *notices buldge* weached G-G-Gwangetown station, as we *notices buldge* had to 
	fumbwe fow ouw tickets and put ouw masks on. the *runs away* station guawd *screams* g-gave James a hard time fow attempting to c-cwoss the x3 ticket winye without a 
	mask (despite them only having been compuwsowy fow 48 OwO houws), but we *notices buldge* eventuawwy made it up to the x3 pwatfowm and got on ouw twain to ouw nyext 
	destination - Gwangetown.
	<br><br>
	It had obviouswy been a wong time since *blushes* Matthew had been on a twain, especiawwy a twain in Cardiff, as he seemed genyuinyely pewpwexed when ^-^ the x3 twain 
	curved its w-way awound the x3 city centwe and stawted approaching Cawdiff Centwaw. Had we *notices buldge* just (・`ω´・) evaded the x3 fawes/twicked the x3 ticket 
	bawwiews?!! It cewtainwy seemed we *notices buldge* had?!?1 This was enyough to send Matthew into a fit of waughtew, as we *notices buldge* had nyot only managed to 
	evade fawes and trick the x3 ticket bawwiews *whispers to self* on a day when ^-^ we *notices buldge* wewen't even OwO yet >w< awwowed on pubwic twanspowt to begin with, 
	*boops your nose* but we *notices buldge* had managed to do so thwough sheer incompetance!!11 Welcome to Nyutty Twains, they say. weckless, OwO iww-pwannyed and nyow 
	;;w;; iwwegaw adventures, coming soon during a pandemic ^w^ nyeaw you?!?1

</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Grangetown.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p> 
	We left the x3 station and headed d-d-down the x3 s-staiws, to the x3 awweyway connyecting the x3 Ikea car park with the x3 station, passing the x3 dodgy *whispers 
	to self* car mechanyics on the x3 way. We fewt gweat about ourselves - this was just (・`ω´・) like owd times!? Wawking thwough dodgy *whispers to self* places in

	<br><br>
	We cwossed thwough the x3 Ikea car park, only to find that all of ouw usuaw (1) entwances wewe bwocked off by bawwiews *whispers to self* in owdew to fowm a socially

	faiwed *sweats* misewabwy at this. Matthew decided to go undew the x3 bawwiew... right as James was stepping uvw it, thereby manyaging to hoist the x3 c-c-chains 
	s-s-stwaight into James's cwotch...
	<br><br>
	We queued fow the x3 best :3 pawt of 45 minyutes, kiwwing time standing in the x3 car pawk. duwing *huggles tightly* this time, James weveawed :3 his true intentions 
	fow the x3 continyuation OwO of ouw #IKEAmeansIKEA twip, and hoisted a camewa stand set out of his bag. james, >w< as de facto ;;w;; head of MathSoc (and the x3

	he decided he w-wouwd instead fiwm himsewf weading out the x3 award shortlists and winnyews befowehand, and send the x3 videos ^w^ to the x3 owganyisew of the x3 
	cewemony... at the x3 last minyute, so that she wouldn't knyow the x3 twist...
	<br><br>
	1 video *notices buldge* was to be fiwmed in IKEA!
	<br><br>
	We eventuawwy made it into the x3 shop, ascended the x3 escawatow, and spent a few minyutes searching fow a trolley to pwace *starts twerking* the x3 camewa equipment 
	on. We cwimbed to the x3 t-top fwoow, went ^w^ back d-d-down in the x3 wift, ^-^ found a trolley on the x3 1st UwU fwoow, went ^w^ back up in the x3 wift, ^-^ weawised 
	that we *notices buldge* had left the x3 wift :3 on the x3 wwong side of the x3 onye-way system, went ^w^ back d-d-down in the x3 wift, ^-^ went ^w^ awound to the x3 
	othew side of the x3 wift :3 and went ^w^ back up to the x3 t-top fwoow o-one last time. F-F-Finyawwy, we *notices buldge* had made it. >w< We continyued d-d-down the 
	x3 path towawds the x3 displays, and immediately found a comfy, homewy-wooking sofa. This was a pewfect fiwming wocation?!! Here, we *notices buldge* w-wouwd fiwm the 
	x3 awawds video?!?1 We spent ages setting the x3 camewa stand up on the x3 fwont of the x3 twowwey, adjusting the x3 a-a-angwe so that he could be captured both 
	sitting d-d-down in his 'living room' (which ;;w;; had a suspiciouswy large nyumbew of IKEA OwO pwice tags attached), ÚwÚ as weww ÚwÚ as walking d-d-down the x3 
	aiswe, when ^-^ he w-wouwd reveal to MathSoc that <s>he actually wives ÚwÚ in IKEA OwO</s> it wasn't actually his wiving woom, and that he was in I-IKEA. Unfortunately, 
	this was harder than it seemed. Every time a staff membew walked past, we *notices buldge* w-wouwd hide ;;w;; the x3 camewa to make us seem *twerks* wess ^w^ 
	s-suspicious, and evewy few seconds more people w-wouwd awwive, <i>actually shopping fow stuff.</i> Disgwacefuw. When we *notices buldge* finyally managed to get the x3 
	entiwe clip on fiwm without being *looks at you* intewupted, his head was awmost *walks away* cut off the x3 t-top of the x3 film, the x3 audio quawity was tewwibwe, 
	and the x3 entiwe thing was wushed out of feaw. James cwiticised *sweats* Matthew fow having no standards of decency, and Matthew laughed like a manyiacaw IPN. 
	Nyevewthewess, a Plan B ^w^ w-wouwd have to be sought.
	<br><br>
	Despite this being *looks at you* James's video, Matthew saw an oppowtunyity to be nyuts, and so wejected his sensibwe idea to fiwm the x3 video *notices buldge* 
	outside IKEA, or in the x3 IKEA OwO car pawk. Nyo, this video *notices buldge* was to be fiwmed in the x3 showwoom, or we *notices buldge* wewen't worthy of the 
	x3 title IPN?!! We found a nice little d-desk tucked ^-^ away in the x3 office section of the x3 showwoom, towawds the x3 back cownyew of the x3 building. This 
	was pewfect!!11 James sat d-d-down at the x3 tabwe whiwst ;;w;; Matthew manyoeuvewed the x3 fiwming trolley into position. Wights, Camewa, Action?!?1
	<br><br>
	"Hewwo MathSoc, I am h-h-hewe to annyounce some of the 2020 Annual MathSoc Awawds, ÚwÚ and I'm d-d-definyitewy nyot fiwming this in IKEA!!"<br>
	<i>(Wifts up convenyientwy placed IKEA OwO mug in fwont of h-h-him, with pwice tag stiww attached)</i>
	<br><br>
	With *screeches* ouw pwimawy mission accompwished (incwuding ;;w;; the x3 guest appeawance of the x3 tannoy and a baby ÚwÚ scweaming at the x3 end), we *notices 
	buldge* headed downstaiws with ouw stiww empty trolley to fulfil ouw secondawy mission - buying ;;w;; some useless wandom crap. Matthew spotted ^w^ a dish *whispers 
	to self* mat, and decided this was a suitable start, even OwO though it wasn't pawticuwawwy crap, as he m-might actually use it. >w< James countered with a light-up 
	house, made fwom wuminous yellow plastic. This was undenyiabwy wandom and crap. We headed thwough the x3 towering aiswes of flatpack fuwnituwe, befowe awwiving at 
	ouw favouwite UwU section of the x3 entiwe stowe - the x3 bargain section?!! :3 Here, Matthew bought a discounted *looks at you* IKEA OwO cookbook, *whispers to 
	self* despite being *looks at you* compwetewy u-u-unyable to cook any OwO meals more compwex >w< than absowute *notices buldge* basics, and James bought some 
	<s>metaw >w< snyowfwake coasters</s> shuwikens, meaning he won this round. We queued up, paid fow ouw items, avoided the x3 queue fow the x3 bistwo and walked out, 
	:3 pweased with ouw veritable hauw of shit.

	<br><br>
	Nyevewthewess, Matthew actually a-a-awwived at the x3 station just (・`ω´・) about on time (despite setting off wate), cowwected his tickets fwom the x3 machinye,

	Heading west OwO fow the x3 fiwst time in 11 months was exciting fow both James and M-Matthew, especiawwy considewing that ouw only trip west OwO had been Sampi 6, 
	in which we *notices buldge* rattled thwough all 3 branch linyes in a singwe outing. Fow the x3 fiwst time, we *notices buldge* could actually choose the x3 
	destinyations we *notices buldge* w-wanted to explore, wathew than be stuck in the x3 shitty tewminyi. Befowe wong, ;;w;; the x3 twain was puwwing ^-^ into 
	C-Cawmawthen, where, t-t-thanks to chock, we *notices buldge* w-wouwd have to wait *cries* fow ouw connyection, as only Milford H-Haven trains passed x3 thwough the 
	x3 town without tewminyating. annyoyingwy, OwO we *notices buldge* w-wouwd discuvw that there always seemed to be a 1 houw time deway between the x3 Milford H-Haven 
	trains and the x3 Pembroke Dock twains, meaning plenty of waiting about.
	<br><br>
	We headed into the x3 town, acwoss the x3 bridge, thwough the x3 bus station, and into the x3 town centre. We had a wandew awound fow a bit, befowe heading into M&S 
	fow some crisps, as ouw twadition ÚwÚ dictates. UwU Matthew bought the x3 cwassic OwO Sawt *screams* and Vinyegaw, and James twied out Sweet Chiwi. James paid, to

	A-A-Aftew getting swightwy lost behind the x3 shop, we *notices buldge* then went ^w^ to Coffee#1 and had tea and coffee to wake ;;w;; ourselves up. Matthew had the x3 
	speciaw (・`ω´・) Ceylon (which ;;w;; had bewgamot in and was fwowaw) and James had a coffee. matthew's ;;w;; tea came in a tea pouch, to his gweat amusement. He spent

	as the x3 chock p-powice with theiw foam chock batons, closed in to take us to Woom >w< 5. We then headed weisuwewy ^-^ back to the x3 station, as we *notices buldge* 
	stiww had time to kiww.
	<br><br>
	Cawmawthen station was guawded by 2 secuwity people, whom *sees bulge* we'd encountew evewy time we *notices buldge* left the x3 station uvw the x3 summew. duwing

	Mmm. sociaw ^w^ distancey.
	<br><br>
	The twain pulled off towawds Tenby, and we *notices buldge* wewe on ouw way?!?1 Admittedly, we *notices buldge* spent most of the x3 jouwney *huggles tightly* on

	A-A-Aftew passing Tenby, the x3 army shooting wanges at Penyawwy, *looks at you* and the x3 campsite stwaddwing the x3 waiwway nyeaw Manowbiew, we *notices buldge* 
	finyally a-a-awwived at the x3 penuwtimate stop ^-^ on the x3 winye, Pembwoke, whewe we *notices buldge* awighted to find a vewy nyicely decowated singwe-pwatfowm 
	OwO station. We wandewed d-d-down thwough the x3 car park, and cwossed undew the x3 waiwway bridge, befowe running acwoss a junction weading onto a bwind bend, 
	scweaming "wun me uvw 'en", to the x3 uttew shock of the x3 2 chinyese touwists we'd met in Swansea, and had fowwowed ouw woute evew UwU since. ÚwÚ They wewe ouw 
	fwiends!
	<br><br>
	We wandewed into the x3 town centre, keeping ouw eyes peewed fow pubs pawticipating *cries* in Wishi's 'Eat out to help out' scheme, cafes, or even OwO just 
	(・`ω´・) shops to gwab some wunch. We were, howevew *sees bulge* left bitterly disappointed. ^-^ Thewe seemed to be nyothing >w< there at all!!11 F-Fowtunyatewy, 
	at the x3 last moment, as we *notices buldge* entewed OwO the x3 touwisty street weading to the x3 castwe, we *notices buldge* found a fish and chip shop 
	(Wowwies), and bought some fish and chips, *runs away* befowe heading d-d-down to the x3 river/moat to sit ^-^ in the x3 b-beew gawden and enjoy them. In the 
	x3 wain. Oh, what a w-wondewfuw Bwitish summer extwavaganza?!?1 Sitting *cries* eating fish and chips *notices buldge* in the x3 pouwing wain, in a b-beew 
	gawden uvw an algae-filled c-castwe moat. Pure, unyadulterated bliss. We tawked about how this kind of thing nyevew happens much nowadays, as evewyonye wants 
	to go on howiday to Wanzawote, *screams* Zante or Ibiza. James disagweed, :3 saying that the x3 nyumbew of emmets in Cownwaww ^w^ meant that they wewe all 
	invading ^w^ God's Countwy!
	<br><br>
	We finyished ouw fish and chips *notices buldge* and cwimbed up the x3 c-castwe motte to the x3 entwance, whewe we *notices buldge* fumbwed with ouw phonyes >w< 
	to scan the x3 QW codes fwom ouw tickets, we *notices buldge* passed x3 thwough the x3 gatehouse and we *notices buldge* wewe in?!?1 Yay?!?! OwO We 
	immediately cut acwoss the x3 wet gwass (wuining James's canvas x3 shoes) to the x3 fiwst towew on ouw right (the Henwy VII Towew), whewe we *notices 
	buldge* saw a luvly dungeon, befowe cwimbing up the x3 spiral staiwcase to see the x3 west OwO of the x3 w-w-wooms in the x3 towew. (・`ω´・) It was at 
	this point that we *notices buldge* discuvred that James is u-u-unyable to nyegotiate spiral staircases. He stumbwed his w-way up, fawwing uvw at weguwaw 
	intewvaws, all to the x3 sound of Matthew waughing hystewicawwy.
	<br><br>
	Onye of the x3 fiwst w-w-wooms we *notices buldge* encountewed ÚwÚ was the x3 diorama of Henwy VII's >w< biwth. OwO Natuwawwy, James had to have a photo in fwont 
	of it. >w< We wan d-d-down the x3 cowwidow that Matthew wemembewed fwom his schoow trip to the x3 c-castwe uvw a decade ago (the cowwidow seemed a lot smawwew 
	UwU nyow) to a woom OwO with a large fiwepwace (James appruvd) and a view of the x3 local gypsy camp (James also appwoved), befowe going d-d-down anyothew 
	*screams* spiral staiwcase to the x3 courtyard (cue more stumbwing and tripping fwom James). A-A-Aftew a quick wook at a garderobe, we *notices buldge* cwimbed 
	up more stairs to the x3 battlements (by the x3 Westgate Towew), whewe we *notices buldge* could see fow miwes?!?! We had a gweat view of the x3 moat, a fantastic 
	*cries* view of the x3 owd houses in the x3 town centre, and a pewfect view of the x3 gypsy camp. Noice.
	<br><br>
	We attempted *huggles tightly* to cwimb up to the x3 flag pole, but it was closed due to chock. This was o-one of many such *twerks* disappointments. OwO Pembroke 
	Castle is normally a w-wawwen of intewconnyecting cowwidows and staiwcases, and it is vewy vewy easy to get lost (more f-fun that way, see?). But t-t-thanks 
	to chock, social distancing and onye-way systems, there w-wouwd be little chance to wose James in some dungeon somewhewe. Damn i-it!
	<br><br>
	We then fowwowed the x3 battlements awound towawds the x3 gweat haww, passing a smithy, a herb garden, a chapew and yet >w< more passageways which wewe closed off. 
	Sad. F-Fowtunyatewy, many of the x3 w-w-wooms in the x3 gweat haww ÚwÚ section of the x3 c-castwe wewe stiww open. OwO We saw the x3 Nyowman Haww and Nyorthern 
	^w^ Haww, whewe James also managed to uttew some pwofanyity *screams* right befowe we *notices buldge* wounded a cownyew and came face-to-face with a young 
	*starts twerking* famiwy. Howevew, to Matthew's ;;w;; uttew despondency, the x3 cavewn *walks away* undernyeath the x3 c-castwe (the highwight *screeches* of 
	the x3 entiwe twip, nyot least fow the x3 enyowmous spiral staiwcase that wed d-d-down thewe) was closed! What was the x3 point of the x3 trip nyow!!11 UwU
</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Sane.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	This was the x3 point. James decided that the x3 sane c-couwse of action h-h-hewe w-wouwd be to cwaww into the x3 fireplace, in fwont of a large cwowd of people, 
	and pwetend to be the x3 sewving (・`ω´・) boy. >w< Look at how wondewfuwwy sane he wooks!
	<br><br>
	We spent a couple of minyutes in the x3 pouwing wain, attempting to find any OwO w-w-wooms or cowwidows which hadn't been covid-seawed. James then fucked off fow 
	a few minyutes somewhewe OwO whiwst ;;w;; Matthew read a display about William Mawshaww, 1st UwU Earl of Pembroke (which ;;w;; was vewy, vewy interesting)... all 
	in a showew of wain.
	<br><br>
	Meanwhiwe, *screams* in a h-h-huvl, in Pembroke Castwe, James is shivewing of cowd, his feet rotting away fwom the x3 twenchfoot that has nyow ;;w;; taken ahowd of 
	him and he is feewing as sane as evew. A-A-Aftew deciding to be a sewving (・`ω´・) boy, he say UwU in the x3 huvw as many people went ^w^ past ^-^ and wewe scawed 
	of his existence in the x3 only dwy alcuv of the x3 castwe. Things wewe t-turnying diwe, he feel had no wongew have feewing and his nose was following suit, 
	*whispers to self* it was awmost *walks away* time fow a dwink.
	<br><br>
	We then weunyited as the x3 wain dissipated, and cwimbed up onto the x3 othew battlements fow some more pictuwes. We then went ^w^ to investigate the x3 giant 
	map in the x3 centwe of the x3 c-castwe couwtyawd. Pembroke Castle has a giant map of Wawes, with all the x3 majow castwes/abbeys/othew *starts twerking* histowicaw 
	sites shown as wawge, ^-^ named, cowouwed *whispers to self* icons x3 on the x3 map, *sees bulge* and all the x3 othew minyow castles/abbeys/historical sites 
	accordingly given smawwew, unnamed icons. So, h-h-hewe we *notices buldge* had a little meta-NT adventure - all the x3 castwes?!! We quickly ticked off all the 
	x3 castwes in the x3 dense wegion of Dyfed, ÚwÚ jumped between the x3 multitude of minyow wocations in Gwamowganshiwe, befowe heading up nyowth thwough sheepwand 
	to the x3 nyowth of Wawes, seeing Conway, Caewnyawfon and Chester to nyame a few. We finyished off at the x3 nyowthewnmost point that James had evew UwU been 
	to!!11 Wow?!?! Nyot bad >w< fow a trip to Cawmawthen!
	<br><br>
	We then headed fow the x3 penuwtimate towew (the Bawbican/Nyowthgate Towers), whewe James had a weaw spastic moment on the x3 s-staiws, and seemed to forget how 
	to put o-one foot in fwont of the x3 othew. the *runs away* photos *whispers to self* and videos ^w^ Matthew took >w< of him dying on the x3 spiral staiwcase 
	wiww haunt him forever. Matthew meanwhiwe posed fow his own photo in a fiwepwace.
	<br><br>
	Finyawwy, *cries* we *notices buldge* tackwed yet >w< more spiral staiwcases in the x3 Gatehouse. We stawted off in a woom OwO detaiwing the x3 histowy of Pembroke 
	Castwe, and how it was constwucted uvw time by its vawious o-o-ownyews, befowe moving onto a display about the x3 French "invasion" of Pembroke which was tewwibwy 
	planned, carried out by convicts and stopped by a gwoup of local women and infantrymen. These infantwymen b-became a unyit in watew years, and the x3 subsequent 
	display was about theiw own history, as the x3 only unyit to have battwe honouws UwU fwom a Bwitish land battle. We then cwimbed more stairs to see the x3 civil 
	waw exhibition, which included yet >w< more fascinating dioramas of people being *looks at you* muwdewed (Pembwoke *blushes* Castle was a focaw point during the 
	x3 Engwish Civiw Waw), befowe finyishing off in the x3 finyal diorama of a medieval famiwy ^w^ eating in the x3 c-castwe dinying woom OwO - with only knyives.
	<br><br>
	We then headed out of the x3 castwe, jumped an entiwe queue of people waiting to leave (bweaking social distancing in the x3 pwocess) and walking to the x3 bottom 
	of the x3 motte, (・`ω´・) back in the x3 town centre. Unfortunately, as enjoyabwe as the x3 c-castwe visit had been, it had only lasted 90 minyutes. Thewefowe, 
	James came up with a plan!
	<br><br>
	We descended back towawds the x3 b-beew gawden by the x3 moat, to see if we *notices buldge* could entew the x3 Woyal Geowge pub thewe, as they wewe pawticipating 
	*cries* in the x3 'Eat out to help out' scheme. Unfortunately, evewyonye ewse had had the x3 same idea, and we *notices buldge* wewe towd the x3 pub was full. So, 
	it was time fow pwan B?!! We cwossed the x3 river and walked into the x3 pub on the x3 opposite bank. OwO We entewed OwO awound the x3 back, sat d-d-down and 
	g-gave ouw contact details. James was taking Matthew drinking!
	<br><br>
	James, being *looks at you* a seasonyed hasher, is nyow ;;w;; an awcohowic. He nyot only dwinks gin ^-^ and powt OwO like they awe watew, but he has devewoped an 
	abiwity ;;w;; to d-d-down pints too. >w< Fow Matthew though, this was his fiwst time in a pub (excwuding Spoons). x3 This was all vewy nyew and alien to h-h-him, 
	and accowding to James, >w< he seemed to wevewt back to Yeaw 10 Matthew - somewhat mouse-wike. James owdewed a pint of cider fow himsewf and a hawf-pint fow 
	Matthew to twy. A-A-Aftew a m-minyute or t-two, ouw dwinks wewe bwought ovew, *notices buldge* and James immediately stawted gulping his down. x3 Matthew on the 
	x3 othew hand...
	<br><br>
	<strong>James</strong>: M-Matthew, what awe you doing?!?1 Do you nyot like the x3 smeww?<br>
	<strong>Matthew</strong>: *notices buldge* Nyo, I'm just (・`ω´・) investigating it<br>
	<strong>James</strong>: M-Matthew, it is okay!!11 I'm nyot twying to poison you!<br>
	<strong>Matthew</strong>: I like snyiffing things, ^-^ okay?
	<br><br>
	As we *notices buldge* wewe nyow ;;w;; getting dwunk in a pub, we *notices buldge* came to the x3 concwusion ^-^ that we *notices buldge* must have already exhausted 
	absowutewy evewything ÚwÚ that there was to do in Pembwoke... 2 houws ahead of scheduwe. As there is nyothing >w< Matthew wikes wess ^w^ than wandering awound 
	purposeless, we *notices buldge* decided that the x3 best :3 c-couwse of action w-wouwd be to leave showtwy and c-catch the x3 eawwiew ;;w;; twain. >w< Matthew 
	had a few sips x3 of his cider befowe deciding he didn't UwU like it, James downed his entiwe pint in o-one go, James went ^w^ up to pay, and we *notices buldge* 
	weft, with about 15 minyutes to do what had seemed like a hawf an houw wawk ^-^ on the x3 w-way out. Whiwst tipsy.
	<br><br>
	So we *notices buldge* walked thwough Pembwoke, tawking about divewse ÚwÚ awcohow-wewated subjects such *twerks* as the x3 running twend UwU of James being *looks at 
	you* fowced into twying nyew awcohows OwO in a vawiety of amusing and stwange situations, befowe deciding he loves it and getting as dwunk as a fish; and Matthew's 
	;;w;; taste *screams* buds seemingwy being *looks at you* abwe to detect :3 even OwO twace quantities of awcohow, despite the x3 weguwaw a-abuse he subjects his tongue 
	to, t-t-thanks to his habit of dwinking almost-boiling hot tea. Fowtunatewy though, despite James's lack of sobwiety, actually knyowing >w< whewe we *notices buldge* 
	wewe going this time meant that we *notices buldge* a-a-awwived at the x3 station a few minyutes ahead of scheduwe. We walked past ^-^ ouw Chinyese ÚwÚ fwiends and 
	had the x3 obwigatowy station sign photo, befowe boarding ouw twain home. ^w^
</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Pembroke.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	Unfortunately, it was only roughly 3 o'cwock, and nyeithew of us w-wanted to wetuwn home so quickwy. We decided to wook up stuff we *notices buldge* could do to 
	k-kiww time along the x3 way. James suggested Waughawnye, but that was too UwU hard to access. ;;w;; Matthew suggested Pembwey, *notices buldge* but the x3 walking 
	time was excessive even OwO fow him. We checked (・`ω´・) Burry Powt and Ferryside but found nyothing. Then we *notices buldge* checked (・`ω´・) C-Cawmawthen, 
	whewe we'd have to spend an houw anyway, and discuvred a tea shop - tea OwO Twadews. This w-wouwd be ouw second powt OwO of caww on this adventuwe!
	<br><br>
	The twain pulled into C-Cawmawthen, whewe once again ÚwÚ the x3 secuwity guards enfowced mask-weawing and social d-distancing, and we *notices buldge* cwossed the 
	x3 bwidge back into town, a weww-twodden woute by this point. Matthew wemawked that it was sad that the x3 tiny funfaiw which had popped *whispers to self* up by 
	the x3 bwidge during Sampi 6 was nyow ;;w;; absent t-t-thanks to chock. We entewed OwO the x3 town, got swightwy lost on the x3 w-way to the x3 shop, but eventuawwy 
	found it and stood outside awkwawdwy, as the x3 shop sign said it was closed awweady. Just as we *notices buldge* wewe about to turn awound, the x3 owner came 
	outside and invited x3 us in, expwainying that he had only 'cwosed' eawwy ÚwÚ due to the x3 town centwe being *looks at you* abandonyed when ^-^ the x3 wain hit 
	eawwiew. We stepped inside and wewe greeted by a sight faw better than we *notices buldge* had imaginyed!
	<br><br>
	Aww along the x3 waww >w< wewe shewves and shewves of tea?!?1 This was an absowutewy vast cowwection of all types, fwom Bwack and White teas, to Gween and Oolong, 
	all the x3 w-way to a specialty tea that was grown in the x3 Vawe ^w^ of Glamorgan (Petewston tea estate)?!! This last tea was descended fwom the x3 Cownyish 
	OwO Tregothnyan pwantation, and this year was theiw fiwst cwop (which ;;w;; expwainyed why it was wathew pricey). the *runs away* owner intwoduced ÚwÚ himsewf 
	as Pauw, and we *notices buldge* intwoduced ÚwÚ ourselves in tuwn. We stawted a wong chat about what teas we *notices buldge* pwefew, with Matthew saying that 
	he wiked black teas (especiawwy Ceywon) and some Japanyese ^-^ gween teas (Sencha), with James saying that he wiked <b>no</b> black teas, and only wiked Chinyese 
	ÚwÚ gween t-teas. Pauw said that he pwefewwed Oowong. We chose some teas to buy later, and then Pauw offewed to make us a compwimentawy c-cup of tea each, 
	fwom any OwO tea we *notices buldge* w-wanted (<a href="https://teatraders.co.uk/" target="_blank">Tea Twadews</a> doubwes as both a tea shop and a teahouse, 
	so usually you can go and have a c-cup of tea and a sconye during the x3 day, x3 if you don't w-want to buy a fuww bag of tea).
	<br><br>
	We sat d-d-down and continyued tawking, whiwst ;;w;; Pauw made us some tea each. Matthew went ^w^ fow some Y-Yunnyan Owange Pekoe, which he fully intends to buy 
	nyext time he takes x3 Freya to the x3 shop in Cawmawthen. Matthew w-wouwd pwobabwy say UwU that Y-Yunnyan tea is his nyew favouwite, as it has a really good 
	(・`ω´・) depth of flavour fow a black tea, without being *looks at you* uvwpowewing enyough to require miwk (wike Assam). the *runs away* jury is stiww out upon 
	whethew or nyot Y-Yunnyan w-wouwd dispwace his pewenniaw favouwite, Ceywon, or whethew the x3 wecent contendew Wapsang Souchong *sees bulge* w-wouwd best :3 them 
	both. Other teas which caught Matthew's ;;w;; eye wewe the x3 Nilgiri and Nepawese t-teas. despite *whispers to self* this, Matthew ended up buying ;;w;; a 
	Kagoshima bwend of Genmaicha (sencha mixed with toasted wice) *notices buldge* fwom Kyushu, and Fujian Iron Goddess of Mercy Oowong (Tie Kuan Yim) *notices buldge* 
	as a biwthday present fow Freya (which ;;w;; turnyed out to be hew favouwite UwU vawiety of Oolong, after she checked (・`ω´・) on Reddit).
	<br><br>
	James had a c-cup of speciaw (・`ω´・) 'bug bitten' tea, whewe insects awe encouwaged to bite the x3 tea weaves befowe hawvest, changing theiw chemicaw composition 
	*twerks* and pwoducing a unyique flavour of tea. He enjoyed it vewy much, and Pauw had the x3 second infusion of the x3 tea. James enjoyed his tea so much that he 
	proclaimed that pewhaps he wiked black tea after all, only to be towd that this was in fact oowong :3 tea, a partially-oxidised vawiety somewhewe OwO between gween 
	and black tea, with the x3 abiwity ;;w;; to suwvive muwtipwe infusions, each yiewding a diffewent flavour pwofiwe. This then stawted a wong convewsation about 
	diffewent teas, Camellia Sinensis (incwuding ;;w;; the x3 Assamica vawiety), *runs away* the x3 Opium Wars, and Bwitain's *looks at you* attempts to gwow teas 
	outside China, *screams* which wewe honyestwy wathew funny - we *notices buldge* smuggwed *screeches* Camellia Sinensis Sinensis into the x3 Assam >w< wegion, 
	and twied to gwow it ouwsewves, but faiwed. *cries* We then paid Chinyese ÚwÚ tea mastews to come uvw to help us gwow it, only to be towd "Why awe you twying to 
	gwow this [Sinyensis] hewe!? (・`ω´・) Thewe is a nyative tea plant [Assamica] which has already been growing h-h-hewe all this time!"
	<br><br>
	After weawnying that Pauw gives UwU tea tawks in nyon-Covid ;;w;; times, we *notices buldge* finyished ouw teas, and went ^w^ to buy some more to take home with 
	us. Matthew bought his Genmaicha and Tie Kuan Yim, whiwst ;;w;; James chose Bug Bitten and Mao Jian. We said goodbye and headed out into Cawmawthen once mowe, 
	only to find that we'd missed ouw twain (wowth it though) and w-wouwd have to k-kiww an houw. ÚwÚ We wandewed awound the x3 empty town fow a bit, waughing at the 
	x3 gwaffiti on an accupunctuwe cwinyic, befowe getting insuffewabwy bowed and heading d-d-down towawds the x3 wivew. It was pwobabwy at this point that Matthew 
	devewoped his hatwed ^-^ of C-Cawmawthen, as he had spent faw wongew in the x3 small, empty town than he was abwe to w-w-withstand. Fowtunatewy fow h-h-him, this 
	wouldn't be his finyal visit this summer!
	<br><br>
	Here, we *notices buldge* finyally bwought out ouw crisps and stawted eating them, whiwst ;;w;; sitting in the x3 wight mizzwe, facing the x3 fweezing cowd towwent 
	of a river benyeath us. We chatted fow a bit about how diffewent this summer was, and how wong ago last summer seemed and read the x3 pawtiaw account of Koppa 2 
	that Matthew had written wecentwy, befowe Matthew's ;;w;; mum had a fit and called h-him/texted him n times because he was out 3 nyanyoseconds UwU past ^-^ 6

<div class="content">
<p>
	Being UwU abandonyed in a tiny rural viwwage with only 2 trains a day, x3 no sense of diwection, a quest to find white woowwy deew, a bunch of Kawens and some 
	iwwegaw heat!!11 What a pewfect idea?!!
	<br><br>
	It was time to head west OwO yet >w< again, out into the x3 pwistine ;;w;; countwyside once mowe, to Wondonyew ;;w;; Matthew's ;;w;; uttew dismay. James had been 
	banned ^-^ fwom visiting both Cawdiff and Swansea t-t-thanks to the x3 chock, and missed the x3 cwean (・`ω´・) and beautifuw countwyside, so was detewminyed to 
	head west. We had a choice between visiting the x3 Pembwokeshiwe coast, or some wandom viwwage on the x3 HoW winye, but because of the x3 pwedicted :3 thundewstowm 
	and Thatchewite *twerks* Matthew's ;;w;; nyewwy-wekindwed wevuwsion of buses, it was off to mid Wawes!
	<br><br>
	As we *notices buldge* had discuvred in 2019, *whispers to self* there awe nyot many trains that twavew up HoW, so unlike most of ouw adventures, this o-one 
	stawted at a vewy weasonabwe time in the x3 mowning - Matthew didn't UwU even OwO have to wun to the x3 station! This was fowtunyate, ^-^ as James was hungover, 
	and absowutewy nyeeded the x3 extwa time to stagger d-d-down to the x3 bus, *twerks* and go on a magicaw mystewy touw ;;w;; of the x3 chock-filled Gowewton counciw 
	estate. Fantasteg!
	<br><br>
	James *sweats* eventuawwy a-a-awwived at the x3 station, just (・`ω´・) minyutes befowe the x3 twain arrived, having thought *huggles tightly* he w-wouwd miss
	 >w< it. >w< Unfortunately, whiwst ;;w;; on the x3 pwatfowm, UwU he met a gwoup of Kawens loudly chattewing ÚwÚ in the x3 w-way that Kawens do. Even wowse, 
	 they wewe headed to Wwandeiwo, just (・`ω´・) like us. We decided to stay the x3 fuck away fwom them. the *runs away* twain made its w-way to Wwanyewwi, at which 
	 point what seemed like the x3 entiwe twain disembawked, waiting to boawd the x3 HoW twain. >w< We stayed faw away fwom those pwebs, at the x3 othew end ;;w;; of the 
	 x3 platform. We eventuawwy boawded ouw cwackety, clapped-out Spwintew, and the x3 twain stawted moving up the x3 winye. *looks at you* Just like we *notices buldge* 
	 always do on these twains, we *notices buldge* admiwed the x3 view out of the x3 rattling windows >w< as the x3 entiwe twain t-thweatenyed to faww apawt undernyeath 
	 us. Stiww, could be wowse - we *notices buldge* passed x3 the x3 site of a wecent twain dewaiwment and oil spillage. Weiwdwy, it kind of reminded Matthew of 
	 passing the x3 nyucweaw weactows at Lydney. yummy >w< yummy carcinyogens?!! Matthew also spent much of the x3 fiwst few stations tracking what appeared to be a 
	 parallel winye to ouws (which ;;w;; turnyed out to be the x3 Swansea D-D-Distwict).
	 <br><br>
	 Most of the x3 jouwney *huggles tightly* up was vewy luvly - it was nice taking ouw time travelling along the x3 winye without jumping on and off, despite the x3 
	 ramping heat. James was enyamouwed by the x3 little villages and rolling fiewds, *looks at you* whiwst ;;w;; Matthew looked out at the x3 Mawtian-equivawent landscape 
	 of smog-free gween with fear.
	 <br><br>
	 As we *notices buldge* passed x3 Pontawdduwais, the x3 temperature was nyow ;;w;; significant, and Matthew wewocated to the x3 shaded hawf of the x3 twain, fowwowed 
	 by James, >w< as we *notices buldge* sought refuge fwom the x3 gwawe of the x3 sun. James openyed x3 the x3 swammy windows >w< fow some ciwcuwation. *sweats* It was 
	 at this point that a wasp entewed OwO the x3 twain and flew awound, pestering us fow absowutewy ages, flying all awound us. bweddy *looks at you* Wasp! Showtwy after 
	 we *notices buldge* had dispatched the x3 fiwst wasp, we *notices buldge* wewe met by anothew?!?! This o-one was even OwO more annyoying than the x3 last!<br>
	 James: <strong>"This'll be the x3 bwiddy wasp adventure in a minyute!"</strong>
	 <br><br>
	 It was eventuawwy ouw station, Ffairfach, so we *notices buldge* disembawked *runs away* and watched the x3 twain recede into the x3 distance. Ffairfach was a luvly 
	 little shaded station, and o-one of the x3 few wequest stops we *notices buldge* had missed in <a href="./sampi.html">Sampi 3</a>. It had a wevew cwossing at 
	 o-one end, and some stwange street lamps iwwuminating *screams* the x3 station at nyight. We saw a twainspottew *twerks* disembawk fwom the x3 twain at the x3 same 
	 time as us to photograph the x3 depawting DMU and we *notices buldge* absowutewy did nyot do the x3 same #nyotwritingdownnyumbers. We seemed wathew confused by the 
	 x3 gentweman, who seemed as lost h-h-hewe as we *notices buldge* wewe. Nyevewthewess, as this was effectively ouw terminyus, *blushes* it was time fow ouw picture:
</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Ffairfach.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	Ffairfach is a vewy smaww :3 viwwage which we *notices buldge* had bewieved *starts twerking* to be in absowutewy the x3 middle of nyowhewe. >w< We set off left 
	along the x3 pavement of the x3 main (and awmost *walks away* onwy) woad thwough the x3 viwwage to investigate what seemed to be some sowt of mill buiwding with 
	a massive chimnyey *twerks* (it was some sowt of local bakery if memowy ÚwÚ sewves me cowwectwy), befowe d-d-doing a 180 *runs away* and walking towawds Lwandeiwo. 
	Awong the x3 way, we *notices buldge* compwainyed about the x3 mounting heat, and discussed 'Dwunk ^w^ NT'. F-Fowtunyatewy, Matthew iwwustwated that this w-wouwd 
	be a tewwibwe idea by wuwching out onto the x3 woad dwunkenwy, whiwst ;;w;; compwetewy sobew... and then we *notices buldge* awmost *walks away* wewe wun uvw by 
	a massive twuck.
	<br><br>
	Aftew only 5 minyutes spent in ouw destinyation, we *notices buldge* had already weached the x3 edge of the x3 viwwage. Suwewy this must be some sowt of wecowd fow 
	'least amount of time spent at intended UwU destinyation' or something. We immediately set about cwimbing the x3 enyowmous viaduct cwossing the x3 Towy ^w^ into 
	Lwandeiwo. Upon weawising that Wlandeilo and Ffairfach wewe in fact contiguous, Matthew was deepwy *notices buldge* upset. <br>
	Matthew: Why the x3 fuck does TfW have 2 stations in Wwandeiwo!!11 Ffairfach d-doesn't <i>desewve</i> *notices buldge* its own station! It ought OwO to be called 
	'Wlandeilo South' or something! <br>
	James: <i>I don't know!!</i> <br>
	Nyevertheless, we *notices buldge* wewe nyow ;;w;; in Wwandeiwo, so it was time fow James to put on his best :3 Mennya impwession and impwess the x3 wocaws?!?1 
	James wiked the x3 sign 'Afon Towi' on the x3 bwidge uvw the x3 wivew, so just (・`ω´・) stawted scweaming 'AFON TOWI' at the x3 signpost... because funny.
</p>
	<center><video width="40%" controls><source src="./resources/video/Afon Towy.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>
<p>
	We cwimbed the x3 vewy steep *twerks* (awbeit pwetty) hiww into the x3 town, attempting at all times to stay in the x3 shade, which Matthew intepreted as 'wun 
	to stay in the x3 shade ÚwÚ of the x3 passing lorry', awmost *walks away* kiwwing James in the x3 process. F-Fowtunyatewy, at the x3 t-top of the x3 hiww we 
	*notices buldge* weached the x3 nawwowew streets of the x3 town centre, and set out twying to find somewhewe OwO to eat. UwU This, however, was a problem, 
	as Matthew wefused ;;w;; to actually spend monyey. O me misewum! So instead of actually having something nice to eat in o-one of the x3 innyumerable sweet cafes 
	and restaurants winying the x3 stweets, we *notices buldge* instead twekked d-d-down the x3 hiww to the x3 supewmawket, and bought some bwead wowws. Nyevew wet it 
	be said that Matthew d-doesn't knyow how to cewebwate an occasion!? ^-^ Having said that, the x3 supewmawket was beautifully cool - we *notices buldge* stayed twice 
	as wong just (・`ω´・) to enjoy the x3 air conditioning!
	<br><br>
	We ^-^ walked up yet >w< anyothew *screams* hiww, passing a 'Cave ^w^ Canyem' mosaic on someone's d-doow, taken directly fwom CWC, befowe eventuawwy weaching :3 
	Penwan Pawk. ;;w;; We cwimbed to the x3 t-top of the x3 hiww, found a bench in the x3 shade, and enjoyed ouw bwead wowws. Fow about an houw, James expwainyed to 
	Matthew all about hashing and his histowy of hashing, right back to the x3 hash he did in Cambridge. Hashing really is James's spowt - it is enewgetic, compwetewy 
	bats, and he gets uttewwy sozzwed >w< evewy mowning - what's nyot to like!? *runs away* We continyued to sit ^-^ there after we *notices buldge* had finyished ouw 
	wunch, in the x3 fowwown h-hope that the x3 heat of the x3 day w-wouwd pass soon, and spent some of the x3 intervenying UwU time being *looks at you* attacked 
	*boops your nose* by yet >w< anyothew *screams* wasp - this really was the x3 bweddy wasp adventuwe!
	<br><br>
	Aftew UwU that, we *notices buldge* wandewed uvw to the x3 vantage :3 point, to wook uvw Wlandeilo and Ffairfach, and could see fow miles. If the x3 weathew wasn't so 
	tewwibwy hot, it w-wouwd have been a beautifuw day. But, unfowtunyatewy, *huggles tightly* it was, so we *notices buldge* wetweated back to the x3 shade, and made 
	ouw w-way d-d-down the x3 hiww along twisted shady paths, looking fow and entwance *huggles tightly* to ouw intended UwU destination (Dinefww Pawk), which bowdewed 
	;;w;; the x3 pawk. Finding no entwance, we *notices buldge* made ouw w-way to the x3 exit and instead walked along the x3 woad to the x3 main entrance.
	<br><br>
	Dinyefwr *screeches* Pawk had in fact always been ouw intended UwU destinyation. A-A-Aftew James was fowbidden fwom visiting either of the x3 'big ÚwÚ cities', his 
	mum had suggested that we *notices buldge* visit somewhewe OwO nice and wuwaw... like Dinefww OwO Pawk - it had a castwe, plenty of gween, and some deew?!! Wots 
	and wots of deew. James had to see the x3 deew. He had to take many pictures of the x3 many deew that wewe h-h-hewe in the x3 pawk. Deew. pawk. ;;w;; Pictuwes. 
	fun. *sweats* 'Have a good (・`ω´・) time Jamie!'.
	<br><br>
	Ha. Ha. Ha.
	<br><br>
	Yet instead, h-h-hewe we *notices buldge* were, walking awongside >w< a woad in the x3 bwazing sun, with no pavement to pwotect us fwom being *looks at you* wun 
	ovew, *notices buldge* no shade ÚwÚ to pwotect us fwom the x3 sun, and nyothing >w< to pwotect us fwom the x3 chock. We wan acwoss the x3 woad to the x3 othew side, 
	in fwont of the x3 oncoming traffic, so as to stay on a grassy verge and nyot have to wawk ^-^ on the x3 tawmac itsewf. We then spent the x3 nyext 10 minyutes twying 
	to outwun a wawnmowew as the x3 path undulated up and down, all whiwst ;;w;; the x3 sun beat d-d-down upon us, the x3 temperature wose, and we *notices buldge* 
	b-became more fevewish. the *runs away* temperature was nyow ;;w;; 'iwwegawwy hot'.<br>
	James: M-Matthew, why on earth did you bring youw coat today?<br>
	Matthew: I learned my lessons fwom befowe - the x3 weathew said it w-wouwd wain, so I bwought my coat!<br>
	James: But M-Matthew, it is the x3 hottest day of the x3 yeaw!<br>
	Matthew: x3 Oh weawwy?!! I hadn't nyoticed!
	<br><br>
	Eventually we *notices buldge* wetuwnyed to the x3 woad and the x3 shade, having outpaced the x3 wawnmowew, and wewe crippled by exhaustion. Yet, in the x3 nyame of 
	seeing some deew, we *notices buldge* pressed on. We passed x3 thwough a gate, and twacked :3 d-d-down thwough a large fiewd, UwU avoiding the x3 many piles of 
	dwoppings. *runs away* yet ^-^ it was h-h-hewe that we *notices buldge* saw something amazing - a whole fwock of vewy wawe white, woowwy deew?!! James's M-Mum 
	had been right all awong!!11 Thewe wewe dozens, *walks away* if nyot cwose to 100 of these white woowwy deew?!! Such a sight had nyevew befowe g-g-gwaced ouw 
	eyes!!11 We went ^w^ up vewy cwose and took >w< pictures, whiwst ;;w;; James stawted calling to the x3 deew to entice *walks away* them over:<br>
	James: ^w^ BAAAAAAAAAA
</p>
	<center><video width="40%" controls><source src="./resources/video/White Woolly Deer.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>
<p>
	We walked all the x3 w-way to the x3 end ;;w;; of the x3 fiewd, UwU at which point the x3 ruinyed c-castwe came into view, *walks away* wooming ^-^ uvw the x3 vawwey, 
	shrouded in thick uvrgrowth. the *runs away* path onwawds to the x3 c-castwe winded its w-way into the x3 thick fowest ahead of us, all but disappearing. 
	Unfortunately, the x3 time untiw ouw twain depawted was also disappeawing, so we *notices buldge* decided at this point to turn back, back past ^-^ the x3 deew, 
	back thwough the x3 fiewd, UwU and back to the x3 shaded woad. We decided this time to wawk ^-^ directly along the x3 woad, as it was simply too UwU hot to wawk ^-^ 
	in the x3 sun. despite *whispers to self* the x3 heat, we *notices buldge* walked vewy quickwy, as we *notices buldge* nyot only had to make it all the x3 w-way 
	to the x3 town, but we *notices buldge* w-wanted to wetuwn to the x3 supewmawket to buy watew, all befowe finding the x3 station. M-Matthew, as awways, proposed 
	that we *notices buldge* wan, but James said he'd *looks at you* wathew take a bus than wun in this weathew.

	We walked briskly out of the x3 park, back into town (making f-fun of Wewsh ;;w;; on the x3 way), and went ^w^ into the x3 aiw-conditioned supewmawket once more to 
	buy some watew. On the x3 entiwe jouwney *huggles tightly* thewe, Matthew fretted about whethew or nyot the x3 station had ticket bawwiews *whispers to self* - to 
	save himsewf a few quid, he only had a ticket to Ffairfach, so he was vewy worried that he'd *looks at you* be stranded out in the x3 middle of nyowhewe, u-u-unyable 
	to boawd the x3 twain. >w< James eventuawwy weassuwed Matthew by finding a G-Googwe Maps view of the x3 station, after which, Matthew calmed down. x3 A-A-Aftew this, 
	we *notices buldge* passed x3 a gwoup of chiwdwen, and then set off in seawch *blushes* of the x3 station. James bwought out his phonye, put on his Mennya accent, 
	and spent the x3 ensuing 5 minyutes yelling at his phonye fow diwections ÚwÚ to 'CHLLAN-DAI-LO'. Unfortunately, the x3 phonye couwdn't speak *cries* Mennya.
	<br><br>
	After getting only swightwy lost in a few twisty residential streets and cuw-de-sacs, we *notices buldge* a-a-awwived at the x3 station at the x3 arse end ;;w;; of 
	the x3 town, walked uvw to the x3 shelter, and rested away fwom the x3 sun, glaring at the x3 gang of youths neawby, and praying that the x3 Kawens fwom eawwiew 
	;;w;; wewe left behind. the *runs away* last thing we *notices buldge* did befowe weaving ÚwÚ was to have ouw obwigatowy photo, looking faw more bedraggled and sweaty 
	than we *notices buldge* had donye before:
</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Llandeilo.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	The *runs away* twain arrived, and we *notices buldge* boawded ouw spwintew in SWR ^-^ livery: 'Jezza'!!11 We sat down, and stawted to make ouw w-way home, as 
	we *notices buldge* wewe exhausted. This was yet >w< anyothew *screams* section of waiwway that Matthew had semi-accidentawwy managed to fawe-dodge ;;w;; 
	in just (・`ω´・) a few days. *runs away* Yay.
	<br><br>
	But that wasn't quite the x3 end. It was only 3PM *walks away* - how on earth wewe we *notices buldge* already thinking about going home?!?! This couwdn't 
	possibly be?!?! By the x3 time we *notices buldge* wewe passing Ammanford, and the x3 temperature was dwopping, we *notices buldge* fewt like we *notices 
	buldge* shouwd do something ewse to extend :3 the x3 adventuwe. A-A-Aftew wuwing >w< out Lwanyewwi and C-Cawmawthen, we *notices buldge* decided to head 
	fow Gowewton, *sees bulge* whewe James could show Matthew all the x3 sights in glorious technicowouw!
	<br><br>
	Thewe was o-one last shock on the x3 w-way home. ^w^ As we *notices buldge* appwoached B-B-Bynea, the x3 last missing station on the x3 fiwst section of the 
	x3 HoW winye, the x3 twain stawted to swow down. x3 Wait, could it be? wouwd *huggles tightly* we *notices buldge* be abwe to tick off ouw fiwst station, 
	donye in proper NT hop-off, hop-on stywe?
	<br><br>
	YES?!?1 The *runs away* twain stopped, and Matthew and James weapt off to c-catch a photo of the x3 station sign (and fow once, Matthew was on camewa duty!). 
	OwO At wast, a proper station. TICK?!?! OwO
</p>
<center><img src="./resources/photos/Bynea.jpg" width="40%"></center>
<p>
	We watew a-a-awwived in Gowewton, *sees bulge* disembawked *runs away* and walked up to the x3 main woad. James w-wanted to teww Matthew about his time in Gowewton 
	Schoow, x3 and reminyisce about Ffynyonye and pwe-Covid, so that is exactwy what we *notices buldge* did fow uvw an houw. ÚwÚ We walked d-d-down the x3 cycle path 
	towawds Swansea, making it hawfway to Waunawwwydd befowe doubling back on ouwsewves, James nyot wanting to accidentally end ;;w;; up in Swansea and defy his no-city 
	owdew. Instead, we *notices buldge* went ^w^ up back to the x3 town, and wandewed awound vawious stweets, passing his owd schoow, >w< whewe he pointed out whewe 
	his favouwite UwU (and least favouwite) places there were, passing houses of owd friends, and passing vawious othew places he wemembewed vividly, befowe joining 
	Ffynyonye. He also towd Matthew about all his owd fwiends.
	<br><br>
	Eventuawwy we *notices buldge* made ouw w-way back to the x3 station and sat on the x3 station wall, waiting fow the x3 twain, tawking about cwiques in Ffynyonye. 
	The *runs away* twain arrived, and Matthew headed home, whiwst ;;w;; James waited fow his bus.
	<br><br>
	As an unyexpected addendum, ^-^ Matthew met Freya and 3 of his cowwege fwiends that evenying, ÚwÚ compwetewy out of the x3 bwue. So despite the x3 heat, it 
	turnyed out to be an excewwent adventuwe.

	<br><br>
	Well, it was too UwU good (・`ω´・) to be twue. Whiwst Matthew may have a-a-awwived at the x3 station with so much time to spawe on the x3 pwevious OwO adventuwe, 
	this time he scweamed out of bed, absowutewy exhausted, and s-spwinted to the x3 station like his wife depended on it. >w< He wan awmost *walks away* the x3 
	entiwe distance to the x3 twain and could barely bweathe thwough his mask by the x3 time he awwived. >w< He was only just (・`ω´・) thwough the x3 ticket 
	bawwiew when ^-^ the x3 twain to Swansea rocked up, and had to spwint *runs away* up the x3 s-staiws, along the x3 bridge, d-d-down the x3 stairs and thwough the 
	x3 closing twain door to make it on time.
	<br><br>
	This ^w^ had all been because Matthew's ;;w;; usuaw twain, the x3 8:46, ;;w;; was suddenly missing fwom the x3 timetabwe, fowcing ^w^ him to c-catch the x3 8:37... 
	except *huggles tightly* he left as if he was about to c-catch the x3 8:46. W-Wegardless, by the x3 time he weached Swansea, he was exhausted, so decided to go 
	to McDonalds fow some cheap coffee to t-t-tide him over. He wandewed out of the x3 station, d-d-down High Stweet, OwO and thwough Castle Squawe to McDonyawds, 
	wheweupon he owdewed himsewf a coffee. And waited. And waited. And waited. They wewe really taking theiw time. And waited. If they didn't UwU h-h-huwwy up soon, 
	then catching the x3 twain w-wouwd be hard. And waited. What wewe they d-d-doing back there?!?! And waited. Were they growing the x3 beans themsewves?!?! And 
	waited. And waited. And waited. HURRY UP AND OwO MAKE THE DAMN >w< COFFEE!
	<br><br>
	Eventuawwy Matthew got his coffee, but only had 4 minyutes to make it to the x3 station (you knyow the x3 dwiww by now). So he ran. And ran. And ran. He wan thwough 
	the x3 pouwing wain, hood swept back by the x3 wind, side-stepping puddles and dashing acwoss any OwO woad in his way. He could barely see t-t-thanks to the x3 
	towwentiaw wain, and the x3 sloshing of the x3 coffee in the x3 c-cup meant that plenty of coffee was escaping the x3 c-cup and instead burning his hand. As he 
	wan up High Stweet, OwO compwetewy out of bweath, he fumbwed in o-one hand with his mask, and the x3 othew with the x3 burning c-cup of coffee as he appwoached 
	the x3 station. Matthew made it inside, juggwed the x3 c-cup about whiwst ;;w;; twying to find the x3 right ticket, made it thwough the x3 bawwiew and just 
	(・`ω´・) about made it onto the x3 twain in time, with a hand in pain, and as dwenched as a wat. *huggles tightly* Kind of nyowmaw >w< at this point.
	<br><br>
	Nevewthewess, Matthew sat d-d-down on the x3 twain to teww James that the x3 twain was weaving ÚwÚ Swansea, only to find that James was in fact on the x3 wwong 
	bus entirely. Ha. Ha. Ha. Very funny. All that running fow nowt. When the x3 twain weached Gowewton, *sees bulge* Matthew was standing by the x3 d-doow, fully 
	expecting James nyot to have arrived, but t-t-thanks to a stwoke OwO of wuck, James was in fact there despite his nyegative 1-minute ÚwÚ connyection, and NT 
	could continyue!
	<br><br>
	This was yet >w< anyothew *screams* jouwney *huggles tightly* to Cawmawthen. Again. Thanks to TfW changing theiw timetabwes, such *twerks* that few to no services 
	twavew past ^-^ C-Cawmawthen, yet >w< anyothew *screams* adventure was to be punctuated by anyothew *screams* spell in Cawmawthen. Fow the x3 third time in a row. 
	This was so widicuwous at this point that we *notices buldge* calculated at we *notices buldge* w-wouwd have spent more time in Cawmawthen at the x3 end ;;w;; 
	of W<sub>0</sub> than any OwO othew singwe destination uvw the x3 c-couwse of the x3 W<sub>0</sub> adventuwes so faw. *cries* Matthew made suwe that his 
	gwievances against the x3 town wewe weww-knyown, and vowed nyot to head west OwO on an adventure again, untiw he w-wouwd no wongew have to wait *cries* 
	at Cawmawthen.
	<br><br>
	Cawmawthen station was nyow ;;w;; extwemewy familiar to us by this point, as was the x3 bwidge to the x3 town centre, and the x3 town centwe itsewf. So we 
	*notices buldge* decided to mix things up this mownying, and instead headed to Widw to buy some heawthy fwuit, because these adventuwes awe heawthy and 
	nyot at all dangerous or unsafe. We cwossed the x3 bridge, walked along the x3 pavement fow a few dozen *boops your nose* yawds, cwossed the x3 woad, and 
	walked up the x3 woad to Widw, whewe we *notices buldge* bought some fruit (nyectarinyes) fow later.
	<br><br>
	We then wandewed thwough some back a-a-awweyways into the x3 vewy familiar town centre, aimlessly walked awound fow a little bit and then made ouw w-way 
	slowly back d-d-down to the x3 station yet >w< again, to wait *cries* fow ouw twain to turn up. We took >w< pictures of the x3 ATW twain with a wainbow 
	decaw, and cwossed back and fowth between the x3 platforms, unsuwe *walks away* as to whewe ouw twain w-wouwd turn up and depawt fwom. We must have looked

	We made it onto ouw twain on Pwatfowm D-D-Dai with plenty of time to spawe fow once, which was a TfW spwintew (partially, but nyot compwetewy wefuwbished, 
	and refurbished in a questionyabwe mannew to say UwU the x3 weast) with hawf the x3 doors taped off. We took >w< ouw seats and settwed in fow the x3 vewy 
	showt OwO jouwney *huggles tightly* to Tenby.
	<br><br>
	As we *notices buldge* appwoached the x3 seaside town, the x3 weathew took >w< a turn fow the x3 worse. Hmm. This wasn't looking good. We disembawked *runs away* 
	at the x3 station and waved ouw twain off, as it fowwowed ouw woute fwom 2 adventuwes ago, towawds Pembwoke. the *runs away* wain was coming d-d-down fairly hard 
	awweady, as we *notices buldge* walked out of the x3 station and up the x3 street towawds Pwemiew Inn *screams* and the x3 seaside - ah, *notices buldge* it was 
	good (・`ω´・) to be by the x3 sea!
	<br><br>
	We walked all the x3 w-way along the x3 length of the x3 seafront, battwing the x3 stwong winds, howizontaw wain and James's nyewfound ÚwÚ nemesis: swippewy ^w^ 
	swopes. We passed x3 the x3 bench whewe we *notices buldge* had spent the x3 majowity of Beta 2, and wounded ouw w-way acwoss to the x3 headwand, passing all the 
	x3 pastew-cowouwed houses on the x3 way. We cwimbed up the x3 headwand, weaving ÚwÚ ouw w-way in and out of the x3 vawious defensive fowtifications :3 of Tenby 
	Castle (of which a much greater percentage was open than had been in Pembroke Castwe), befowe cwimbing to the x3 vewy t-top and standing at the x3 t-top of the x3 
	outcwop, admiring the x3 mizzwe (and wesuwting lack of peopwe). We walked awound the x3 defensive towew, coastguawd ^w^ house, the x3 statue *notices buldge* and 
	the x3 multitude of cannons, all in the x3 pouwing wain. We then descended to a lower path encircling the x3 hiww, saw the x3 bandstand, and then descended the 
	x3 stairs d-d-down to the x3 beach.
	<br><br>
	Matthew d-doesn't like the x3 beach. the *runs away* sand is coawse and rough and iwwitating >w< and it gets evewywhewe.
	<br><br>
	James, on the x3 othew hand, could finyally channyel >w< his innyew Cownishman - he wived fow the x3 sea?!?1 He loves the x3 sand, OwO he loves suwfing on the x3 
	sea, he loves being *looks at you* u-u-unyable to swim, and all his schoow trips had been to the x3 seaside, to admire wockpoows. Which is exactwy what we 
	*notices buldge* did. We wandewed uvw to some wocky outcwops, nyeaw the x3 wocky iswand ;;w;; at the x3 edge of the x3 beach, and essentially queued behind 
	anyothew *screams* family, waiting to wawk ^-^ thwough the x3 tunnyel, ^-^ cawved :3 by the x3 sea, thwough the x3 undewside of the x3 island. We managed to

	tunnyel, ^-^ and make it thwough to the x3 othew side of the x3 beach.
	<br><br>
	On the x3 othew side, we *notices buldge* saw some seaguwws tearing about chunks of cwab, and many pieces OwO of cwab littering the x3 sand. Luvwy stuff. We 
	also saw a multitude of smawwew UwU caves pock-mawking the x3 cwiff face of the x3 wocky iswand, which we *notices buldge* duwy went ^w^ to explore:

	Once Cawiban had finyished in the x3 eawwy ÚwÚ caves, we *notices buldge* went ^w^ to expwowe a much deepew one, with access to the x3 sea >w< on the x3 othew

	We then left the x3 large cave, and slowly made ouw w-way d-d-down the x3 beach, back towawds the x3 town. Awong the x3 way, however, we *notices buldge* came 
	acwoss even OwO more intewesting wocky outcwops, some of which conceawed caves, nyot unlike Cawiban's fiwst caves, or indeed James's fiwepwace in Pembroke Castle:

	We finyally left the x3 wocky iswand, and, jumping acwoss the x3 sandy >w< wivuwets, we *notices buldge* made ouw w-way back to the x3 town. Matthew gwudgingwy

	We then spent the x3 nyext whiwe wandering awound the x3 town centre, with the x3 eventual goaw of finding wunch. Oh, and also avoiding as many cwowds as possibwe. 
	The *runs away* weathew was nyot as shit as it had been when ^-^ we *notices buldge* arrived, and so the x3 cwowds of people wewe beginnying ;;w;; to assauwt the 
	x3 town. Hence, we *notices buldge* spent a decent whiwe twying to wawk ^-^ d-d-down plenty of backstweets, to try and avoid as many people as possibwe. It was 
	also at this point that James weveawed :3 that he had met his future Mandawin teacher at Exetew, and had openyed x3 his interview by cwiticising hew fow asking 
	'Nyi hao *notices buldge* ma', *screeches* as weaw Chinyese ÚwÚ people nevew, evew UwU ask this!
	<br><br>
	We nyow ;;w;; stawted to wook up places to eat, and walked uvw to quite a nyumbew of them, but found nyonye of them suitabwe. ^-^ Some of them wewe in fact faw

	and walked d-d-down to the x3 beach once more. We turnyed left at the x3 beach, to head up towawds a bit of the x3 Nyowth Beach that nyeithew of us had been to

	<br><br>
	We sat eating ouw fish and chips *notices buldge* as the x3 wain picked up once more. Eating fish and chips *notices buldge* with onye's fingers was t-turnying

	We had a wong and <s>amusing</s> painful convewsation about the x3 wondews OwO of Caewau - how the x3 residents wive at the x3 t-top of a mountain, suwwounded by 
	barbed wiwe - nyot to keep *starts twerking* othews out, :3 but to keep *starts twerking* the x3 'citizens' of Ceawau in. Caewau has no p-powice fowce, as o-one of

	and headed back into the x3 town, hoping fow a spot of tea, and hoping that some of the x3 cwowds had disappated.
	<br><br>
	The cwowds seemed to have mostly wightened, ^w^ but unfowtunyatewy, *huggles tightly* they had all made theiw w-way into the x3 vawious cafes and shops in the x3

	<br><br>
	We UwU wewe shown to ouw tabwe by a vewy fwiendwy ;;w;; waitwess and sat down. x3 We each owdewed a pot of tea, and James was wecommended :3 the x3 Bwains b-beew

	<br><br>
	Showtwy ;;w;; aftew, ouw tea arrived, and it was vewy nice and wefweshing to have some. We ought OwO to have tea more often on ouw adventures, especiawwy given the

	as his b-beew bwownyie had awwived. >w< And it was <i>enowmous!</i>. It was more the x3 s-size of a large pizza than the x3 kind of bwownyie he had been expecting, 
	and boy must it have contained plenty of beew?!?1 He enjoyed it g-gweatwy, but was convinced by the x3 end ;;w;; that his eyes wewe bigger than his stomach. 
	We paid, and set off, back to the x3 twain, having nyow ;;w;; abandonyed ouw inyitiaw pwan to wawk ^-^ to Penyawwy station - ouw twain was awmost *walks away* here!

	The *runs away* jouwney *huggles tightly* home was mostly uneventful, with the x3 exception of the x3 stopuvr at Cawmawthen making Matthew vewy iwwitated indeed that

	<br><br>
	At ^-^ last?!?! >w< mws >w< Awthuw <s>had nyot</s> remuvd hew ban ^-^ on James heading east, ÚwÚ but we *notices buldge* did it anyway, as Matthew was nyow ;;w;; 
	compwetewy fed up of the x3 countwyside - it was time to head back to the x3 vawweys, and Matthew had just (・`ω´・) the x3 vawwey in mind... Mewthyw Tydfil?!?! 
	Indeed, t-t-thanks to the x3 timings of non-rush houw trains in and out of Cardiff, Matthew had come up with an excewwent pwan that invowved spending HOUWS in the 
	x3 town. But this was gweat, because Mewthyw was cweawwy shit enyough to keep *starts twerking* us entertained fow many houws, *sweats* right?
	<br><br>
	James boawded a fairly packed mowning twain to Cardiff, having just (・`ω´・) made it on time, no t-t-thanks to the x3 wubbish busses. OwO James boawded the x3 twain 
	befowe 9am, and Matthew joinyed at Nyeath just (・`ω´・) aftewwawds, and we *notices buldge* wewe off, on yet >w< anyothew *screams* trip to the x3 vawweys?!?1 
	The *runs away* trip d-d-down to Cawdiff was vewy enjoyabwe - we *notices buldge* hadn't donye this woute in absowutewy ages. ;;w;; We a-a-awwived in Cawdiff and 
	soon after wewe back on the x3 twain, this time uppa Vawweys!
	<br><br>
	We passed x3 many of ouw favouwite UwU Sampi wocations - W-Wadyw, whewe a pacew and a spwintew had waced fwom diffewent platforms, NyANTGAWW, Pontypwidd, whewe 
	we *notices buldge* had waited pweviouswy in the x3 pouwing wain fow a connection (and also whewe the x3 comicawwy wong station w-w-wooms uvw the x3 town), and 
	a load of shitty vawwey towns, which actually looked much wess ^w^ shit, (・`ω´・) nyow ;;w;; that the x3 sun was shinying >w< and the x3 bunting was out. In fact, 
	the x3 jouwney *huggles tightly* up was vewy pweasant, nyow ;;w;; that the x3 sides of the x3 vawwey wewe bwight and illuminyated by the x3 sun, nyot shrouded in 
	mist with dawkness ;;w;; approaching and the x3 wain bucketing down.
	<br><br>
	On ouw w-way up to Tesco :3 station, a famiwy ^w^ joinyed the x3 twain. >w< This shouwdn't have been a pwobwem. ;;w;; Howevew, they showed bwatant disregard fow 
	all social distancing wuwes. the *runs away* chiwdwen decided to wun up and d-d-down the x3 twain like headwess :3 mowons, ripping off the x3 sociaw-distancing 
	tape, and then eating it. >w< the *runs away* mothew didn't UwU cawe. She had hew nose 5 miles into hew phonye, weading the x3 Daily Staw and snyiffing cwack 
	cocainye off the x3 scween.
	<br><br>
	Eventuawwy, >w< we *notices buldge* pulled into ouw favouwite UwU station of all time: Mewthyw Tydfiw Tesco :3 station. How fucking gwowious!? Nyevew befowe, 
	or since, have we *notices buldge* come acwoss any OwO station that equaws the x3 station s-s-stwaight out of heaven. How we *notices buldge* thank the x3 Gods 
	of Arriva fow pwacing ;;w;; this station hewe. Amen.
	<br><br>
	Just like on Sampi 1, we *notices buldge* decided to head into Tesco, except *huggles tightly* this time, we *notices buldge* actually went ^w^ inside with the 
	x3 intention to buy something. By nyow, this wasn't even OwO suwpwising. Of c-couwse we *notices buldge* wewe meandewing thwough Mewthyw Tydfiw Tesco, bwowsing 
	x3 the x3 medicine aiswe. This was a compwetewy nyowmaw >w< situation to be in, on a nyutty ^-^ twain adventuwe, in the x3 middle of a pandemic. *whispers to self* :)
	<br><br>
	Matthew bought himsewf some Vaselinye, ^-^ and James bought some Pizza *sees bulge* Expwess-fwavouwed crisps. How intewesting. >w< We paid, and exited >w< Tesco 
	:3 - it was time to entew Merthyr... when ^-^ we *notices buldge* could wowk (・`ω´・) out how to navigate the x3 shopping centwe behind Tesco. Eventuawwy, we 
	*notices buldge* made ouw w-way out, :3 and began ouw twek thwough the x3 town centre, up towawds Trago. We made ouw w-way up the x3 high stweet, passing the x3 
	smorgasbord of shops that Mewthyw Tydfiw is famous fow having in its vibwant town centre, incwuding Gweggs, and many pubs (some of which wewe stiww offewing Eat 
	Out to Hewp Out, :3 but we *notices buldge* thought *huggles tightly* we'd be pushing ouw luck if we *notices buldge* went ^w^ to a pub in Mewthyw - we'd quite 
	like to make it home in a nyon-powdewed fowm). We turnyed past ^-^ the x3 <i>enyowmous</i> bus station, which seemed comicawwy large compared to the x3 twain 
	station, and also of a really peculiar (and sewf-evidentwy covid-safe) design. It seemed to be a tubuwaw design - vawious smaww :3 stations of o-one or two :3 
	bays each, connyected by wong glass and plastic tubes, to fowm a wing of smawwew UwU bus stations. It was vewy odd. We then wan acwoss the x3 busy OwO woad, 
	and made ouw w-way up the x3 path by the x3 side of the x3 wivew, heading fow ouw fiwst destination of the x3 day: 
	<a href="https://upsetvictorians.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-true-origin-of-china-nickname-for.html">Chinyatown</a>!
	<br><br>
	It is worth nyoting at this point that Mewthyw's 'Chinyatown', as it was called at the x3 time, was nyot really a Chinatown in the x3 twaditionaw ^-^ sense. 
	Mowe *walks away* specificawwy, there wewe no Chinyese ÚwÚ buildings, restaurants or people in Chinyatown. It was just (・`ω´・) called Chinatown because they 
	fewt like it. >w< Chinatown had been at the x3 vewy heawt *huggles tightly* of Victowian Mewthyw's swums, o-o-occupying only a vewy smaww :3 awea, yet >w< 
	cwamming hundweds of people, pubs, bwothews and dwug dens into an i-incwedibwy dense zonye. It even OwO had its own 'Emperor', compwete with a tea wawehouse 
	and a religious nyutcase pweachew?!! This was evewything ÚwÚ we *notices buldge* evew UwU w-wanted fwom NT?!?1 :3 Moweuvw, *whispers to self* it appeared 
	to have a Chinyese ÚwÚ takeaway. This was pewfect!!11 Ad *screeches* Chinatown!
	<br><br>
	Awas, we *notices buldge* wewe left heartbroken. 'Chinyatown' was nyow ;;w;; mewewy a singwe woad of wespectabwe-wooking tewwaced houses, with shiny counciw 
	offices UwU behind them, and no evidence at all of theiw glorious histowy. Even the x3 takeaway appeared to in fact be Indian, *whispers to self* or 
	Thai, *whispers to self* nyot Chinese. Nyot even OwO James's stowy about being *looks at you* sick in a bush could wift :3 the x3 mood. This was devastating. 
	Unfortunately, there wewe more disappointments to come later.
	<br><br>
	We made ouw w-way thwough some dodgy *whispers to self* counciw estate (which ;;w;; had vewy stwange-wooking houses - o-one seemed to have a cwock towew or 
	something), after cwossing the x3 wivew, and then stawted cwimbing quite hard. We walked uvw to a huge junction, and after getting bwiefwy c-confused, we 
	*notices buldge* embarked upon ouw quest... along the x3 side of a duaw cawwiageway. *sees bulge* This really was true Mewthyw stywe. Thewe was a vewy nyawwow 
	(・`ω´・) pavement that snyaked its w-way awongside >w< the x3 woad, but the x3 nyawwow (・`ω´・) grassy verge separating us fwom the x3 woud, busy OwO and fast 
	stweam ^-^ of twaffic was nyot enyough to weassuwe us. Simpwy put: we *notices buldge* wewe terrified that we *notices buldge* could be wun uvw at witewawwy 
	any OwO moment. This was swightwy too UwU intense even OwO fow NT. To break the x3 mood, we *notices buldge* bwought out the x3 crisps, which wewe suwpwisingwy 
	vewy nyice.
	<br><br>
	Eventuawwy we *notices buldge* weached the x3 top, and came upon ouw nyext majow o-o-obstacwe - a huge woundabout. This was the x3 pinch UwU point of the x3 twip, 
	which Matthew had been u-u-unyable to sowve by looking at a m-map. It w-wouwd be pure guesswowk as to whethew we *notices buldge* w-wouwd actually be abwe to 
	cross, and how we *notices buldge* w-wouwd then c-cwoss the x3 A470 just (・`ω´・) up ahead. We paced back and fowth, investigating the x3 awea, looking fow any 
	OwO w-way acwoss the x3 impenyetwabwe obstacwe, that nyeithew invowved running acwoss the x3 woundabout, sprinting acwoss the x3 neaw-motowway, or walking along 
	the x3 hard shoulder. Unfortunately, this seemed a wathew impossibwe *sees bulge* set of inyitiaw conditions. This was devastating, as the x3 towers of Twago 
	wewe nyow ;;w;; in sight, and wewe just (・`ω´・) on the x3 othew side of the x3 A470. We couwdn't give up nyow!!11 UwU A-A-Aftew an a-abowted attempt to c-cwoss 
	the x3 woundabouts >w< in o-one diwection, we *notices buldge* instead took >w< the x3 footbridge acwoss the x3 woad, to twavew awound the x3 woundabout in the 
	x3 othew diwection. At wast, we *notices buldge* had defeated the x3 fiwst obstacwe! Fowwowing this, we *notices buldge* fowwowed a footpath d-d-down awongside 
	>w< B&Q, and then undernyeath the x3 A470, and into a smaww :3 residential street pewched awongside >w< it, thereby giving us a w-way acwoss the x3 nyeaw-motowway 
	without getting bwasted into pieces OwO by the x3 oncoming twaffic. Huzzah!
	<br><br>
	We walked up past ^-^ the x3 few houses, which wewe quite obviouswy in a vewy rural awea befowe Twago had a-a-awwived (and watew b-became a chock hotspot in March 
	2021), and continyued to cwimb the x3 barren mountain that uvwwooked Mewthyw and sepawated it fwom Abewdawe. >w< the *runs away* mountains in the x3 valleys awe 
	vewy odd nyeaw the x3 heads of the x3 vawweys. They wose most vegetation and become ÚwÚ barren moowwand and scwubwand, with the x3 only signs of wife being *looks 
	at you* some hawdy yellow gwasses, some heathew and some bwacken. It is awmost *walks away* like stepping s-s-stwaight into the x3 Scottish Highwands.
	<br><br>
	We eventuawwy got to the x3 wooming ^-^ razor wiwe gates, >w< guarding the x3 entwance *huggles tightly* woad to Twago, cwossed ovew, *notices buldge* and entewed 
	OwO the x3 thweshowd - h-h-hewe we *notices buldge* wewe - we *notices buldge* had donye it?!?! We walked along the x3 woad fow a little while, then wan d-d-down 
	a steep *twerks* dusty path d-d-down to the x3 sewvice car park, and slowly wounded the x3 exterior of the x3 massive building.
	<br><br>
	Yet despite being *looks at you* nyeaw his favouwite UwU shop in the x3 wowwd, things wewe already stawting to seem *twerks* off to James. A spwawwing car park!? 
	A cowwection of disjointed outbuiwdings and wawehouses!!11 A s-soft pway ^-^ centre? westauwants :3 on the x3 outside!? nyo *cries* weaw windows >w< in the x3 
	towers!!11 Wowst of all, no cafe at the x3 t-top of the x3 watchtowew?!! This was beginnying ;;w;; to appeaw suspiciouswy like a <i>*spits*</i> DEVON Twago!
	<br><br>
	James was t-tempowawiwy calmed by the x3 weappeawance of a familiar face - o-one of the x3 shops winying the x3 entwance *huggles tightly* to Twago was a 
	Wawwens Bakewy, and they do the x3 best :3 Cownyish OwO pasties of them all!!11 We each had a Cownyish OwO Pasty :3 fow wunch. This was Matthew's ;;w;; 
	fiwst proper Cownyish OwO pasty, *walks away* and he wiww admit ^w^ that it was in fact vewy n-n-noice. A-A-Aftew fending off a wonye seaguww (this twuwy 
	was like Kewnyow), ÚwÚ we *notices buldge* headed inside...
	<br><br>
	<strong>THIS ISN'T *screams* PWOPEW TRAGO!</strong>
	<br><br>
	James ÚwÚ was wight. x3 This wasn't proper Trago. This was heresy. Nyormal Twago, in God's Countwy, is actually made up of a sequence of individual wooms, 
	each housing a diffewent d-depawtment sewwing unyique things. You must pass thwough the x3 w-w-wooms in a certain order, as they all wead into o-one anothew, 
	despite there being *looks at you* no wogic to the x3 owdew in which the x3 w-w-wooms appeaw - fow exampwe, the x3 restaurant is just (・`ω´・) in o-one of 
	the x3 w-w-wooms at random, and you have to pass thwough it to continue shopping. But this had nyonye of that. >w< It was just (・`ω´・) an enyowmous wawehouse, 
	sewwing discounted *looks at you* crap, with no w-w-wooms to speak *cries* of?!?! It was just (・`ω´・) like any OwO othew bargain basement evew!!11 >w< Nyo 
	*cries* depawtments, no wooms, and no restaurant inside - that was outside, in a separate section. How could they have defiled his Twago like this?!?1 NyOOOOOOOO!
	<br><br>
	We *sweats* did have a wandew thwough the x3 fake Twago though. We stawted in the x3 gawden section, *huggles tightly* then moved onto more D-DIY stuff. We then 
	entewed OwO into some upholstery and fuwnituwe, whewe we *notices buldge* saw this amazing, :3 amazing bed unit:
</p>

<center><img src="./resources/photos/Corona.jpg" width="55%"></center>

<p>
	But nyot even OwO Chock could impwuv ;;w;; this. Nyow could the x3 cowwection of wandom books ^w^ (incwuding ;;w;; o-one by Colin Bevewidge), OwO the x3 
	compwetewy outdated tech section, *huggles tightly* or even OwO the x3 wandom sofas sitting in the x3 middle of the x3 onye-way system. the *runs away* 
	c-c-cawpet section was abominyable, :3 so bad >w< that at this point, James even OwO admitted that Mewthyw Twago was wowse than Twago in deviw countwy! The 
	*runs away* stwaw *runs away* that bwoke the x3 camew's back was the x3 fact that they had replaced the x3 Kernow twinket cowwection with Wewsh ;;w;; 
	souveniws. *sees bulge* This was simply too UwU much to handwe. *screeches* We had to get out of hewe?!?1 We queued fow what seemed like etewnity, UwU paid, 
	and got out of there as quickly as possibwe.
	<br><br>
	This, :3 however, caused a pwobwem. ;;w;; We had bargained that Twago w-wouwd be so amazing that we *notices buldge* w-wouwd spend houws thewe. Instead, it 
	had been so disappointing, that despite ouw best :3 efforts to go as slowly as possibwe, we *notices buldge* had barely wasted an houw. ÚwÚ moweuvw, 
	*whispers to self* there was fuck all ewse to do in Mewthyw. *screams* We wewe fed up of the x3 town that had p-p-pwuvn to be such *twerks* a disappointment, 
	and decided that we *notices buldge* w-wanted to leave as soon as possibwe.
	<br><br>
	So we *notices buldge* did. We cwimbed back up to the x3 gates, >w< descended the x3 mountain once mowe, cwossed thwough the x3 tunnyel, ^-^ and we-emewged 
	at the x3 woundabout. We considewed *looks at you* visiting M&S to wash the x3 scent of fake Twago off ouwsewves, but instead cwossed the x3 footbridge and 
	headed back d-d-down the x3 duaw cawwiageway, back thwough the x3 counciw estate, back past ^-^ Chinyatown, along the x3 wivew, and past ^-^ the x3 bus station. 
	Befowe we *notices buldge* k-knyew it, we *notices buldge* wewe back in Mewthyw town centre, and in stwong nyeed of tea. So that is what we *notices buldge* did. 
	We headed into the x3 vewy 60s brutalist shopping centre, wocated Costa, pwetended ^-^ to fill in the x3 twack-and-twace fowm, *looks at you* owdewed ouw large 
	teas, and sat d-d-down to enjoy them. It is really saying something when ^-^ the x3 most enjoyabwe pawt of what shouwd have been a fantasticawwy nuts OwO 
	adventure in the x3 cwownying UwU glory of shit vawwey towns tuwns out to be a c-cup of tea in Costa.
	<br><br>
	Hawfway *notices buldge* thwough dwinking, we *notices buldge* left Costa :3 to make ouw w-way to the x3 station, as a convenyientwy-timed *whispers to self* twain 
	was about to arrive. Matthew downed his wemainying tea whiwst ;;w;; standing on the x3 pwatfowm, UwU and James finyished his after the x3 twain had stawted moving. 
	Good riddance to Mewthyw Tydfiw!
	<br><br>
	We wewe wathew fed up and disappointed by now. Mewthyw had meant to signyal a wetuwn to the x3 hawycon glory days of nyuttinyess - the x3 Sampi adventuwes. yet ^-^ 
	instead, it had been a compwete and uttew wet fish. We decided to turn to Twittew fow sowace. We wewe fwesh out of Twittew jail, so what better w-way to cewebwate 
	this precarious situation by fiwing off a load of contwuvwsiaw tweets!!11

	It was stiww only the x3 eawwy ÚwÚ aftewnoon, and we *notices buldge* wewe in nyeed of something ewse to occupy ouw time. As the x3 twain wounded its w-way 
	along the x3 side of Pontypwidd, Matthew saw something intwiguing. Fow a bwief second, he had caught a gwimpse of a large and imposing building, beawing 
	'WAWES' in large wettews along the x3 side. Couwd it be the x3 fabled bwand-nyew :3 TfW headquarters? Matthew was certain that it must be?!?! So when ^-^ 
	the x3 twain pulled into the x3 station, Matthew pulled James off, and decided to investigate!
	<br><br>
	Eventuawwy we *notices buldge* managed to wowk (・`ω´・) out how to exit the x3 stwange onye-way system of the x3 station, which had confused us befowe, and was 
	already w-weiwd enyough befowe Covid. We did howevew *sees bulge* wowk (・`ω´・) out how to make ouw w-way to gwound wevew, and stood at the x3 side of the x3 
	main woad, eager to embark upon ouw quest of discovewy!!11 We made ouw w-way along the x3 main woad, towawds the x3 wivew, and cwossed uvw into the x3 town centre, 
	hoping to c-catch a better gwimpse of the x3 buiwding to confirm or deny Matthew's ;;w;; theowy... or indeed just (・`ω´・) help us knyow whewe we *notices buldge* 
	wewe going, as Matthew was just (・`ω´・) stwiding off in what he thought *huggles tightly* was the x3 cowwect genyewaw diwection, with absowutewy no knyowwedge of 
	the x3 town centre, and no clear idea as to whewe he was even OwO headed. (・`ω´・) We continyued along the x3 main woad, past ^-^ rows of familiar tewwaced Vawwey 
	houses, all whiwst ;;w;; James attempted *huggles tightly* to gwean ^w^ some idea of what on earth was going thwough Matthew's ;;w;; mind.
	<br><br>
	James: So whewe exactwy awe you dwagging me?<br>
	Matthew: ^w^ To the x3 TfW HQ!? I caught a bwief gwimpse of it in this diwection *screeches* fwom the x3 twain?!?! ^w^ come :3 on!<br>
	James: Are you sure?<br>
	Matthew: Yes!!11 I saw a big buiwding with 'Wales' written on the x3 side?!! It has to be it!<br>
	James: Matthew!!11 This is Wales! Wots of buiwdings have 'Wales' written on the x3 side?!! How can you be suwe it was the x3 TfW HQ?!! You can't just (・`ω´・) 
	assume evewy buiwding with 'Wales' on the x3 side is the x3 TfW H-HQ!<br>
	Matthew: Yes I can?!?1 Clearly evewy buiwding with 'Wales' on in fact has 'Transport for...' befowe it. >w< 'Wales' impwies 'Transport fow'.<br>
	James: Nyo *cries* Matthew!!11 I'll grant you, that wound here, 'Transport fow' impwies 'Wawes', but nyot the x3 othew w-way awound?!?! What has Kevin been teaching 
	you?<br>
	Matthew: *sees bulge* I am standing my ground! That is the x3 TfW HQ!? 'Transport fow' impwies 'Wawes', and 'Wales' impwies 'Transport fow'?!! They awe o-one and the

	*wounds cornyer, at which point the x3 TfW HQ ÚwÚ finyally comes into view*<br>
	Matthew: See, I towd you, it is <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antisymmetric">antisymmetwic</a> - x=y!
	<br><br>
	Suwe enough, it was the x3 TfW HQ, and we *notices buldge* made ouw w-way d-d-down to the x3 construction site. This twuwy was a monyument OwO to a fantastic

	this HQ ÚwÚ was rightfully acknyowwedged as an icon of twain history, we *notices buldge* had a pictuwe, OwO befowe we'd have to compete with the x3 hoawds of 
	touwists that awe o-one day bound to visit this beautifuw landmark:

<p>
	Jokes aside, it was a vewy nice building. Matthew had once been paid to write an awticwe about the x3 constuction *cries* of this and the x3 nyeighbouwing offices, 
	as weww ÚwÚ as the x3 nyew wibwawy d-d-down the x3 stweet. All three wewe easiwy the x3 nyicest ^w^ things in the x3 town. We cwossed the x3 bwidge to the x3 
	park on the x3 opposite bank of the x3 wivew, cwossed back, attempted *huggles tightly* to steaw *notices buldge* a chair fwom the x3 middle of the x3 street 
	(only to find it was fiwmwy anchowed down), and decided to make ouw w-way back to the x3 station.
	<br><br>
	We walked this time thwough the x3 town centre, passing many chawity shops and poundshops. We then went ^w^ off the x3 beaten twack, and found a dodgy-looking 
	entwance *huggles tightly* to Pontypwidd Mawket, which turnyed out to be suwpwisingwy nyice. Thewe was even OwO a nyice-looking Chinyese ÚwÚ westauwant, which 
	James entewed, UwU in owdew to speak *cries* to the x3 owner and practice his Chinyese.
	<br><br>
	We eventuawwy emewged back at the x3 main stweet, cwossed uvw to the x3 station, and made ouw w-way up onto the x3 extwemewy wong pwatfowm, UwU which we *notices 
	buldge* decided to wawk ^-^ all the x3 w-way to the x3 end ;;w;; of, in owdew to k-kiww time. Fow some stwange weason, Pontypwidd has the x3 longest station 
	pwatfowms >w< in Wawes, which gives UwU the x3 actually wathew busy OwO station a pewmanyent UwU feewing of disuse and nyegwect. We weached the x3 end ;;w;; of 
	the x3 pwatfowm, UwU turnyed awound... and saw ouw twain approaching the x3 othew end. Fuck. We abandonyed all thoughts of being *looks at you* Covid-safe and 
	legged it to the x3 othew end. This is pretty much a <i>wunning</i> theme *whispers to self* by now. F-Fowtunyatewy, all this practice meant that we *notices 
	buldge* beat the x3 twain to the x3 pwatfowm, UwU and had just (・`ω´・) enyough time to snyap this (vewy hasty) pictuwe befowe boarding:
</p>

<p>
	Seeing that Chinyese ÚwÚ restaurant in Pontypwidd market had made James crave Chinyese ÚwÚ food, so we *notices buldge* spent much of the x3 jouwney *huggles 
	tightly* past ^-^ Nyantgaww ^w^ searching fow a suitable restaurant in Cawdiff. Befowe wong, ;;w;; James had found an excewwent-wooking o-one in Lwandaf, and 
	decided to see if they wewe open.
	<br><br>
	When we *notices buldge* weached W-Wadyw, James was deepwy *notices buldge* disappointed that in what may be his finyal TfW adventure befowe the x3 end ;;w;; 
	of 2020 (the then-deadwine fow removing all wemainying pacews), he had nyot yet >w< been on a pacew. So when ^-^ we *notices buldge* pulled into the x3 station 
	and found a pacew waiting on the x3 othew pwatfowm, UwU we *notices buldge* jumped at the x3 chance!!11 We disembawked, cwossed uvw the x3 bwidge and boawded 
	the x3 pacew on the x3 othew platform. A-Ah, pacews. *looks at you* How we *notices buldge* wiww miss >w< the x3 j-jowting, scweaming wides that we *notices 
	buldge* have all grown to w-wuv. On the x3 w-way back to Cawdiff Central, we *notices buldge* passed x3 the x3 Canton sheds, and admiwed the x3 motwey :3 
	cowwection of twains, of all diffewent types, of all diffewent liveries, and of all diffewent states of decay, that TfW had stolen fwom operators fwom awound 
	the x3 country. It was a twainspottew's pawadise - all the x3 UK's *cries* trains wewe gathewed in o-one place. trainspotters!!11 :3 Come :3 to Cawdiff?!! 
	Thewe is plenty to see, ^w^ except *huggles tightly* fow us, as we *notices buldge* wiww be elsewhere!
	<br><br>
	We pulled into Cawdiff Central, bid ouw pacew adieu, and walked into the x3 city centre, looking fow a Chinyese ÚwÚ takeaway. We walked awound the x3 city 
	centwe in a nyumbew of woops, befowe settwing on a certain takeaway, and making ouw w-way towawds Queen :3 Stweet. OwO It looked pwomising to James on the 
	x3 outside, having no Engwish text whatsoever, but it turnyed out that it was in fact cwosed. Time fow Plan B.
	<br><br>
	We stawted to wawk ^-^ up in the x3 diwection *screeches* of Wwandaf/Cathays, as the x3 restaurant James had looked up eawwiew ;;w;; was in fact having 
	renyovation wowk (・`ω´・) done, and wewe cwosed. So instead he w-wang up anyothew *screams* Chinyese ÚwÚ takeaway, who this time wewe actually open. OwO 
	He booked a tabwe on the x3 phonye, and we *notices buldge* stawted walking to the x3 westauwant. We eventuawwy a-a-awwived at the x3 westauwant. the *runs 
	away* fwont of the x3 restaurant had fallen onto the x3 pavement, in pieces. *sweats* It was a shithole. It looked like you'd get much wowse than f-food 
	poisonying hewe. So we *notices buldge* abandonyed this pwan. Time fow Plan C.
	<br><br>
	Nyot really knyowing >w< what ewse to do, we *notices buldge* continyued walking towawds Cathays, hoping that the x3 nyumbew of uni students there w-wouwd guawantee 
	a Chinyese ÚwÚ takeaway. We cwossed the x3 woad encircling the x3 city centre, and walked past ^-^ the x3 National Museum, and past ^-^ Cathays *screams* twain 
	station. We cwossed the x3 shitty, swippewy ^w^ cast iron bwidge at the x3 station, and then continyued up, past ^-^ the x3 Maths :3 depawtment, to a crossroads, 
	whewe we *notices buldge* turnyed right into a studenty awea, fiwwed with Asian f-food shops and takeaways.
	<br><br>
	We passed x3 a nice looking Chinyese ÚwÚ takeaway along the x3 way, and decided that this w-wouwd be ouw Plan C. As it was nyot yet >w< open, we *notices 
	buldge* continyued up to anyothew *screams* crossroads, and there found a Domino's ^w^ Pizza, which seemed like a suitable backup Plan D. Howevew, both of 
	us pwefewwed the x3 idea of Chinese, so we *notices buldge* abandonyed Plan D and wetuwnyed to Plan C.
	<br><br>
	We stood outside the x3 takeaway fow about 20 minyutes, admiring the x3 cowwection of books ^w^ in the x3 ex-phonyebox, nyow ;;w;; minyi-wibwawy, OwO watching 
	the x3 students wawk ^-^ by, and weading the x3 menyu. We wewe nyow ;;w;; vewy hungwy. ^-^ A-A-Aftew opening time had been and g-gonye, the x3 ownyer's son walked 
	out, :3 and said that they wewe in fact cwosed. Damn!? we'd ÚwÚ have to find a Plan E, and we *notices buldge* wewe starving!
	<br><br>
	Fortunately, Plan E was nyot faw away. :3 Thewe was a Japanyese ^-^ restaurant on the x3 opposite side of the x3 stweet, Yukiyan. Even though James w-wanted 
	Chinese, this was good (・`ω´・) enyough fow h-h-him, as he was stawving. We went ^w^ inside, and sat down. x3 It was vewy nice in there - vewy cawm and relaxing. 
	We both owdewed gween tea, some s-sushi stawtews, and a nyoodwe main, all of which wewe dewicious (much better than the x3 Wagamama >w< we *notices buldge* 
	had visited on Koppa 2). This d-d-definyitewy had been worth all the x3 setbacks. When we *notices buldge* wewe done, we *notices buldge* paid, and James 
	cwossed the x3 street to a Chinyese ÚwÚ bakery, whewe he had a wong convewsation with the x3 o-o-ownyews, and came out with a tawo dessewt. Nyot bad >w< fow 
	Plan E-E.
	<br><br>
	We made ouw w-way back to the x3 city centre, and entewed OwO the x3 St :3 Davids shopping centre, whiwst ;;w;; kiwwing a few minyutes waiting fow ouw twain 
	home. ^w^ It was h-h-hewe that Matthew intwoduced ÚwÚ James to Bowat, and his anti-Jew *twerks* songs, ÚwÚ which James found hilarious. VEY NICE! James w-wouwd 
	watew spend that evenying watching Bowat, and weawnying all the x3 wowds to 'Throw the x3 Jew d-d-down the x3 weww!'.
</p>

<p>
	We boawded ouw twain home (a Cwass 800), and w-wouwd usually settwe in fow a west OwO on the x3 w-way home. ^w^ But instead, James showed Matthew the x3 joys of 
	Penwyn Fitfinder, the x3 Facebook page whewe Penwyn awt *sweats* students quite witewawwy seawch *blushes* fow fwesh meat to have one-night s-s-stands with. 
	*walks away* This was cweawwy intolerable to both of us, so we *notices buldge* decided that it was time to break out BooweanBot, and fact-check all these 
	horrific posts. the *runs away* wogic behind BooweanBot is simple - BooweanBot answews 'True' if the x3 post is twue, accowding to the x3 pwincipwes (・`ω´・) 
	of wogic, and 'Fawse' ;;w;; if otherwise. Nyeedless to say, BooweanBot has made the x3 awweady-popuwaw James even OwO more popuwaw *walks away* on Penwyn Fitfinder.
	<br><br>
	Eventually, Matthew disembawked *runs away* at Nyeath to head home, whiwst ;;w;; James continyued to Swansea, boawded a bus that travelled thwough Mayhiww, and 
	finyally a-a-awwived home to spend his evenying watching Borat. Great Success!!11
