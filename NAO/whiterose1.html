    RED ALERT; RED ALERT - James has come to the North! This most probably represents the end of the world, the freezing-over of hell, and the perfect time to buy 
    gold (coming soon to the NT Redbubble), but in the meantime, let's see what fun northern activities and delicacies Matthew can introduce James to!

    I will be totally honest with you, dear readers - I never believed this day would come. I believed that my move to Leeds in 2023 represented the end of 
    Nutty Train adventures in my back garden. Indeed, I had to wait a very long time for this one - almost 18 months - but this day has finally arrived. It 
    was time for us to visit Leeds together for the first ever time, and go on a little adventure. Unfortunately, I now live further from a railway station 
    than at any other point in my life (since I was 3), and I have taken correspondingly fewer trains as a result. However, 1 location stands out as a semi-regular 
    destination, and so when it came to planning this trip, our destination was obvious - Ilkley.

    Predictably, the day did not start fantastically. James had a bit of a nightmare journey into Leeds due to ongoing maintenence works in Huddersfield station, and 
    my journey was little better, thanks to the buses in Leeds perennially sabotaging me if and only if I have somewhere to be urgently. They arrived in the city 
    centre at 11-ish, and I finally rocked up at 12-ish, finding James busy chatting in MathsCity - a mathscomm attraction in the Trinity Centre in Leeds. It is a 
    cool attraction with lots of fluid demonstrations, and <s>astonishingly, I had never been before</s> not astonishingly, I had never been before as it cost money. 
    Quite a substantial amount of money. Here is one of their fluid tanks, showing the formation of waves between 2 immiscible stratified fluids:

    I then took James on a whistle-stop tour of Leeds, given that on their previous visit up here over 2 years ago, I had not even applied for my place here. Our 
    whistle-stop tour included the town hall, Park Square, the University etc - i.e. the big postcard/instagram-appropriate attractions + where I spend most of my 
    time. My detractors are very quick to point out that my 'tours' of locations only focus upon the worst that areas have to offer, so here I made a conscious effort 
    to limit the horrible brutalist content of the tour to ~75%: this represents a staggering improvement over the Koppa adventures, where we visited Huxley frequently, 
    yet have never even passed Buckingham Palace during any of our 18 adventures. Yikes.
    <br><br>
    With the tour reaching its conclusion, we headed to Leeds train station (still under reconstruction, to my chagrin), and luckily managed to catch a train to Ilkley 
    with less than a minute to spare. We might be much older than we used to be, but it simply wouldn't be Nutty Trains without running for a single train.

    The train journey up to Ilkley is always a nice one, even in poor weather. The landscape is varied and quite dramatic, starting in the post-industrial docklands, 
    passing through a nexus of lines and junctions, travelling through a very deep cutting through Burley and Kirkstall, before emerging onto the floodplain and the 
    rolling countryside beyond. Then, there are a few miles of rural tranquility, punctuated only by the occasional village (and concrete council block), before entering 
    the deep glacial valley where the line terminates. The trains on this line are also interesting - they announce themselves with <strong>"Welcome to the Ilkley 
    train"</strong>, as opposed to "This train terminates at Ilkley". I haven't seen this in other parts of the country before.
    <br><br>
    Upon arrival we went on a second whistle-stop tour, this time of Ilkley. We had a brief circuit round the town centre, then headed straight to Booths, such that 
    James could experience the Waitrose of the North. Review: 5 blue rosettes out of 5.
    <br><br>
    <strong>It's literally just Waitrose but oop naarth and cheap - it's a pity it's not down south</strong><br>
    <strong>Well we have to have <i>something</i> nice up here!</strong>
    <br><br>
    We headed to a local lounge to have some tea (we were both shattered) and to rest - James in particular was shattered after their long journey and busy schedule. 
    Here, we provisionally planned NTCI 3dz: that's right world, Nutty Trains will be back in Kernow/Devon in June! Oooh arghh!

    By about 4, it was time to head home before the light faded, such that James could get back before stupid o'clock. We left Ilkley, station 888, caught 'The Leeds Train', 
    and returned to Leeds. My mission on this adventure had been to show that the North isn't entirely bad, and I think I succeeded in that. Armed with this success, I 
    can now get away with countless adventures to some of the most miserable and soul-crushing locations in the UK outside the South Wales Valleys! After all, you knew 
    deep down that we hadn't changed one iota, didn't you?
