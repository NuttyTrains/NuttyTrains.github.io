    James returns to the North. Having fooled James into coming back, Matthew decides to show James the true side of the North... but James has a few ideas of 
    their own...

    This was a bright and early start for me: time was constrained this morning - this adventure would be ending at 2pm, by hook or by crook. I walked to my office, arriving 
    before 8:45 (I was not even the 1st person there). I then headed to the station, picked up my West Yorkshire Day Ranger, before catching my TPE to Huddersfield. The time 
    was only 9:30 but I was on the move.

    I showed up in Huddersfield, awaiting James' arrival. In hour of Menna, we elected to meet at Mena Foods. We did not stay long. Instead, we wandered around 
    Huddersfield, which was very much an ultimate UK town - it gave me enormous Swansea déjà vu. We went to an old-timey market, then a 1970s market, and explored a 
    glorious high street. I had seen some poster advertising that Huddersfield has a station cat, but we were running short on time, so I never got the chance to 
    show this to James. Instead, we caught a train to Leeds. 
    <br><br>
    I don't remember much about this train, apart from me ranting, and attempting to show James a nice (but non-existent) viewpoint en route to Leeds. Instead, upon 
    arrival in Leeds, we immediately caught a 2nd train to Bradford via Kirkstall and Apperley Bridge, completing that line from White Rose 1. This line out into the 
    countryside is always very pretty. For all my (endless) complaints about this part of the world, the Dales are beautiful. The Dales had nothing on Bradford though - 
    Bradford was exactly as magnificent as I hoped it would be - there was public artwork for Ramadan in the main square (in front of trans flags and the police museum), 
    the city centre was dilapated and rundown (it looked like Swansea post-recession), and one street was blocked off as a police crime scene. It was perfect.

    Bradford was also interesting as we uncovered a brand-new platform 0: take that Matt and Geoff! We wandered around a couple of streets, passing an allegedly beautiful 
    Waterstones, and many other magnificent institutions. I had previously been to Little Germany and was underwhelmed, so we avoided this, and only headed to the most 
    2008 Swansea-core locations: dilapidated shopping centres and abandoned shops and offices, as well as shops with kwality neon signs. Of course, it simply wouldn't be 
    Nutty Trains if we then didn't manage to get lost and trapped - we entered a shopping centre, believing it to be a shortcut, only to find there was no other way out, as 
    the doors were boarded up - lovely stuff. 
    <br><br>
    Having explored Bradford extensively, we then jogged to the station and took a train down to Halifax. The scenery en route was particularly dramatic, especially at 
    Low Moor, which seemed to have some kind of Iron Giant-inspired artwork: super weird. At Halifax, we also admired the scenery (and the Quality Street factory). It turns 
    out that Halifax has a number of pretty buildings (I revisited this place a few weeks later), but we had no time - we had to imminently return to Leeds! We returned via 
    Bradford to Leeds, completing all the lines out of Bradford (thank God). We passed through Pudsey, which gave me (and possibly also James) flashbacks to that Year 11 
    assembly we did about <s>Children in Need</s> Pudsey Bear: yes, the bear is named after this West Yorkshire town.

    We arrived back in Leeds at about 13:45, whereupon James hoped to catch a train back to Huddz for tutoring - alas, the curse of Northern struck, and the train was 
    cancelled. I, on the other hand, was reyt - I was back in Leeds in time for my seminar at 2. They said we couldn't do NT in a morning, but they (whomever 'they' are) 
    were wrong! It's good to be back doing tiny adventures on home turf - I've missed this.
