    <b>NT goes to the South Coast and Matthew loses an eye in Hastings</b><br>
    This standalone adventure is our first (and so far only) trip to the South Coast. If this adventure gains a fwiend, then it will move to a nice 
    new home. Until then, welcome to the orphan adventures!

    RIP - this didn't happen lol

    <strong>WELCOME TO THE CONCLUSION OF THE AMNESIA ZONE!</strong>
    <br><br>
    The 13th adventure on our quest marks the beginning of the end - but also the end of a 4 year phase of NT, for this is the final Imperial 
    adventure in the NT canon. To make the most of our easy access to London, we embarked upon a major quest to reach the South Coast, which 
    was once planned to be an entirely new adventure class in its own right, but 4th year instead relegated it to a sad little orphan, tacked 
    on at the very end. Indeed, Matthew left London for good but a few days after this adventure, hence his recollection of exact details 
    remains very fuzzy. Indeed, he had just completed his M4R viva on the previous Thursday, and would leave Kensal Green next Wednesday. 
    Hence, let's end this period with the send-off it (finally) deserves - goodbye, good riddance and genbatte!
    <br><br>
    Now, you might believe that as Matthew had now completed Imperial* (*he still had 1 deferred exam), he would be ready to get up early and 
    tackle the wonders of the South Coast, whilst James, still eye-deep in Kaibo's project (amongst other things) would be the bottleneck. 
    Not so. Matthew had <s>limped</s> <s>crawled</s> <s>dragged</s> <s>scraped</s> tortured himself across the finish line, and then promptly 
    collapsed. When things went badly wrong for him on the overground that morning, followed by things going worse in his house, he was pretty 
    broken by it - this adventure would wait until he was ready to limp to Waterloo.
    <br><br>
    James on the other hand was up bright and early, and was awaiting Matthew in Basingstoke... for many hours. This is where the curse of 
    Basingstoke began, and the author would like to take a moment to remember James' noble sacrifice here, and would like to formally apologise 
    for subjecting James to this torture - soz.
    <br><br>
    James then continued to Winchester, where he had a much better time - he saw the cathedral, some Roman ruins, and some other history stuff 
    that Max probably made James visit, and that Matthew had been too lazy to get a move on in order to see. Indeed, the majority of this 
    adventure was actually spent in Basingstoke and Winchester, sans Matthew - for this reason, there was no way on God's green earth that we 
    were making Hastings as intended tonight. Matthew finally rocked up at Winchester at 3pm, having been resoundly beaten down and then 
    fucked over by trains at Waterloo, whilst James had spent substantial amounts of time in various spoons, sampling the worst of the scum  
    on offer in Winchester, and the highest haute couture Basingstoke could dream of.

    James joined Matthew on the train at Winchester at long last, and we headed south towards Southampton.
