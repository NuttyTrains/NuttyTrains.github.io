    <b>NT goes to the South Coast and Matthew loses an eye in Hastings</b><br>
    This standalone adventure is our first (and so far only) trip to the South Coast. If this adventure gains a fwiend, then it will move to a nice 
    new home. Until then, welcome to the orphan adventures!

    RIP - this didn't happen lol

    <strong>WELCOME TO THE CONCLUSION OF THE AMNESIA ZONE!</strong>
    <br><br>
    The 13th adventure on our quest marks the beginning of the end - but also the end of a 4 year phase of NT, for this is the final Imperial 
    adventure in the NT canon. To make the most of our easy access to London, we embarked upon a major quest to reach the South Coast, which 
    was once planned to be an entirely new adventure class in its own right, but 4th year instead relegated it to a sad little orphan, tacked 
    on at the very end. Indeed, Matthew left London for good but a few days after this adventure, hence his recollection of exact details 
    remains very fuzzy. Indeed, he had just completed his M4R viva on the previous Thursday, and would leave Kensal Green next Wednesday. 
    Hence, let's end this period with the send-off it (finally) deserves - goodbye, good riddance and genbatte!

    Now, you might believe that as Matthew had now completed Imperial* (*he still had 1 deferred exam), he would be ready to get up early and 
    tackle the wonders of the South Coast, whilst James, still eye-deep in Kaibo's project (amongst other things) would be the bottleneck. 
    Not so. Matthew had <s>limped</s> <s>crawled</s> <s>dragged</s> <s>scraped</s> tortured himself across the finish line, and then promptly 
    collapsed. When things went badly wrong for him on the overground that morning, followed by things going worse in his house, he was pretty 
    broken by it - this adventure would wait until he was ready to limp to Waterloo.

    James on the other hand was up bright and early, and was awaiting Matthew in Basingstoke... for many hours. This is where the curse of 
    Basingstoke began, and the author would like to take a moment to remember James' noble sacrifice here, and would like to formally apologise 
    for subjecting James to this torture - soz.
    <br><br>
    James then continued to Winchester, where he had a much better time - he saw the cathedral, some Roman ruins, and some other history stuff 
    that Max probably made James visit, and that Matthew had been too lazy to get a move on in order to see. Indeed, the majority of this 
    adventure was actually spent in Basingstoke and Winchester, sans Matthew - for this reason, there was no way on God's green earth that we 
    were making Hastings as intended tonight. Matthew finally rocked up at Winchester at 3pm, having been resoundly beaten down and then 
    fucked over by trains at Waterloo, whilst James had spent substantial amounts of time in various spoons, sampling the worst of the scum  
    on offer in Winchester, and the highest haute couture Basingstoke could dream of.

    James joined Matthew on the train at Winchester at long last, and we headed south towards Southampton. We changed trains at Southampton Central 
    (I seem to remember this was a short change), then took our first train east. It skipped the first few stations in inner Southampton, but after 
    this, we did a pretty good job in hitting all the stations on the line - good job past James and Matthew! Well, that is partially a lie - my station 
    list (the only evidence this damn adventure even exists) suggests that our train sped pretty rapidly towards Chichester, but we <i>did</i> hit all 
    the little stations on the return journey!
    <br><br>
    I remember very little as we passed into Sussex. We saw some cool castles, and crossed a few rivers... and probably did some other shit (I have no 
    clue really - this amnesia is not fun to have), before pulling into our first destination of the day - Bognor Regis. Glorious Bognor Regis. To 
    achieve this, I am pretty sure we made a split-second decision to change at a small station (Barnham) onto the Littlehampton-Bognor shuttle - more 
    on that one later.
    <br><br>
    To try and aid my failing memory, I just dropped into Google Maps to look at Bognor Regis. I remember almost nothing of what I saw on Street View, 
    with 2 exceptions - the desolate shopping arcade near the seafront, and the seafront itself. The former was truly bizarre, I will admit. We were 
    travelling to the south coast on Summer Saturday at a reasonable time in the afternoon/evening, so we expected some life in the town. Not so. We 
    didn't see another soul in that shopping arcade. It was truly very eerie. There was more life in Torquay in December by an order of magnitude!
    <br><br>
    We headed towards the pier at Bognor, where we had some chips, and admired the flock of seagulls gathered nearby. Long-time readers will be very 
    aware that we at NT do not approve of seagulls, and that Matthew in particular has waged a ceaseless, tireless war against this aerial pest:
</p>

<p>
    Hence, Matthew decided to bait the seagulls with some tasty chips, to make them his friend... only to betray them! Stupid seagulls never saw it 
    coming! (James did not approve of this latest battle against this seaside scourge. Something, something "it's illegal, you can't do that".) I 
    think it was at Bognor where we mucked about and tried to climb along the groynes despite the high winds - more on that later.
    <br><br>
    We were pretty done with Bognor after an hour or so, so we caught the shuttle all the way to Littlehampton. RTT claims this service no longer 
    exists, and honestly, it is possible that this service never existed and I am making this all up. I hope you don't come to this website for 
    accurate information - we have never served you that nonsense here at NT! Regardless, <i>I</i> remember getting on a shuttle train that took 
    half an hour to reach Littlehampton. This station was honestly pretty far from the coast, so we wandered for a while to the edge of the houses, 
    before wandering even further to the seaside itself. Unlike at Bognor, where the Victorian buildings brush up right against the promenade, at 
    Littlehampton, the buildings just... stop... followed by a trek across the grass to the beach itself. On a normal day, this would be totally fine, 
    but as mentioned earlier, winds were already strong at Bognor, and had become even stronger here. In short - we spent our entire time getting 
    sandblasted, which, dear readers, is not a very fun experience, but a very appropriate NT experience! I remind you of one of our earliest quotes: 
    <br><br>
    <strong>This isn't tourism, this is masochism</strong>
    <br><br>
    Apart from this aggressive sandblasting, the only other thing I recall from Littlehampton was a particularly weird children's castle structure. 
    I had no idea what this was until I just checked Google Maps now - it was apparently a mini-golf course? How utterly bizarre.
    <br><br>
    Finally, we boarded our train once more, and returned west. There was still ample daylight (it was the height of summer after all), but we were 
    getting tired, and moving along this south coast corridor was much slower than anticipated - it would take about 2 hours to return to Southampton! 
    I unfortunately remember almost nothing from the return leg, which was a mostly uneventful exercise in mopping up all the stations we sped through 
    en route to Bognor... apart from 1 event. The slow train we had been on terminated at Portsmouth, meaning we would once again be travelling south 
    to mop up another branch - but there was a problem. By this point, we essentially wanted to get home whilst hitting as many new stations as possible, 
    but without lengthening our journey. The most optimal route back would avoid Southampton and head up the cut-through line via Botley and Hedge End 
    (see attached map), and this train would depart from Portsmouth... right before we arrived. Bugger. Moreover, we had no 
    tickets to reach Portsmouth - double-bugger. To resolve this, we decided on the truly bizarre decision to take this train well into inner Portsmouth, 
    disembarking at Fratton, changing trains, and reversing up back towards our destination (with questionable tickets - shhhh). Needless to say, Fratton 
    was a bit of a dumpy station, and that this truly weird manoeuvre was rendered entirely redundant when our next train was delayed at Portsmouth and 
    Southsea - the next, much nicer station along the line. Illi vitae.

    Once again, I remember nothing of the return journey, apart from a single fun fact - the last new station of the day was Micheldever, which is one of 
    Matthew's ancestral villages. He was honestly rather surprised to learn it (still) had a station, and was very happy that we managed to accidentally 
    tick it off before we parted ways.
    <br><br>
    This adventure marks the end of Matthew's time in Imperial, bringing a long and very active chapter of the NT story to a close. Less than a week after 
    this adventure, he would move out of London for good. This made him very sad indeed. 4 years earlier, we had still been mopping up South Wales as young, 
    enthusiastic 17 and 18 year olds. Now, we were broken-down, exhausted and miserable, mentally and physically ill shadows of our former selves... but 
    with qualifications! Was it not all worth it in the end? 
    <br><br>
    At this point in time Matthew did not know what lay ahead for him, but in under 3 months, he'd 
    be starting a PhD in Leeds (from where he is writing this now). James still had 2 more months in Oxford before a similar chapter of their life came to a 
    close. Neither of us knew what would happen to NT, but writing this 18 months later, I think it is safe to say that we are both happy with the European 
    direction that NT has headed in - whizzing around on TGVs, riding the Paris metro, or experiencing Swiss trains that <i>actually run on time</i> brings 
    back a lot of the joy we felt on our earliest adventures. Going forward (indeed, starting with this adventure), you can expect far more 
    <strong>special</strong> adventures - France, Switzerland and Christmas, to name a few, as we navigate this brave new world of PhDs. À bientôt, mes amis!
