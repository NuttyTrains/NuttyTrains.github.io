    <strong>WELCOME TO THE CHRISTMAS AMNESIA ZONE!</strong>
    <br><br>
    Adventure 10: CHRISTMAAAAAS! For the first time in a number of adventures, I actually remember the existence of this one - wow! Even better, 
    I actually have a video to work from! Even more wow! Yet, past Matthew was right - I did not get around to writing this until 2024 (I thought I'd 
    give this one a shot whilst suffering with death, just like on this adventure). By this point, death aside, Matthew is very slowly improving... 
    right as James begins to suffer: welcome to a new stage of trauma! The rest of the videos here will never, ever see the light of day!

    The day started bright and early for James, and less so for Matthew, who was dying. The goal on this adventure was to make maximum usage of our 
    completely fucked tickets (which essentially allowed us unlimited travel in Kent for an entire weekend, which is truly crazy), and to make it to 
    Dover by the end of the evening. What could go wrong?
    <br><br>
    Well it turns out that James' train to Paddington was the first thing to go wrong. It meant that the adventure itself did not exactly start bright 
    and early - James arrived at Imperial at just gone 10am, to find Matthew looking like a ghost dressed in a ushanka. Matthew had a particularly spicy 
    form of death and was genuinely not feeling good - it is actually a wonder that he survived 2 days in the freezing cold: the things we used to do for 
    content when we were still young and energetic is quite astonishing. By southern standards, it was truly freezing that day.

    The first order of the day was to head to St Pancras International, caffeinate Matthew, feed James, and catch the highspeed train! It was HS1 time, 
    which was very exciting. St Pancras is a beautiful station, even though the anti-immigrant barbed wire that encloses the Eurostar trains in a cage is 
    somewhat of a eyesore. The Javelin highspeed trains were very cool to ride, even though we, from our far more worldly PoVs as PhD students, would scoff 
    at their rusticness now. In almost no time at all, we had zipped down the line, through the tunnel (avoiding East London), out into the marshes of the 
    Thames, and to Ebbsfleet. It was time to tick off some stations!
    <br><br>
    The next task was to disembark at Ebbsfleet 'International' (note to readers: all the signs were in French!), and then sail our way through the ocean of car parking spaces 
    until we finally reached 'civilisation' on the other shore. And my goodness, it was a glorious civilisation! We saw a small industrial estate, the world's most 
    dilapadated football stadium, and a dodgy roundabout where we were nearly run over by a car! Everyone, and I mean <i>everyone</i> needs to see the Golden Gri_l and 
    All-day Engllish Breakfast! What a glorious welcome to any potential international passengers disembarking in Good Old Blighty!
    <br><br>
    But why were we doing this? Perhaps it is now time to briefly consult the map.

    As you can see here, the highspeed line bisects the slow line at Ebbsfleet 'International'. We intended to keep travelling east on the slow line (towards Chatham), and 
    we could indeed have just boarded a Javelin train from St Pancras that did exactly that. This would leave us in a bit of an unfortunate situation though: we had 
    <i>started</i> this line in London, reaching Dartford, but we would then have missed 4 annoying stations enroute. Therefore, we decided to walk to the nearby Northfleet, 
    double back to Dartford, and <i>then</i> proceed east to Chatham. Consequently, this was the ridiculous and convoluted plan that we decided upon, and this was what we 
    were now putting into action. (Meanwhile Matthew was genuinely dying - this was not fun).
    <br><br>
    I am actually writing this whilst watching the video (scroll up), A) because 
    it has been 2 years since this adventure so I don't remember anything, and B) I was clearly barely holding myself together into something that maybe passed for Â¬a corpse, 
    so I don't think I <i>ever</i> remembered anything. I mention this because past James has reminded me of all the strikes taking place in 2022 - certainly an alien 
    concept to me now in 2024...

    <strong>Last year we brought you Christmas on a cliff. This year we bring you Christmas from the middle of a roundabout!</strong><br>
    <strong>This station doesn't deserve more use</strong>
    <br><br>
    Here, dear readers, I must inform you of something <strong>VERY IMPORTANT</strong>. Upon arriving at Northfleet station and admiring the concrete, pile of fags and 
    mountain of litter, we introduced a BRAND NEW, FULLY TRADEMARKED piece of CONTENT: <u>'Tasty Matthew Snack Time'<sup>TM</sup>, Patent Pending</u>. It has recently 
    come to our attention that <a href="https://nebula.tv/videos/jetlag-we-played-hide-and-seek-across-japan">certain upstart, copycat Youtube channels</a> have copied 
    this 100% original, artistically creative and trademarkable segment of content, where Matthew attempts to ingest cough syrup and instead spills it on himself. To 
    those copycat channels (which we know <i>will</i> be reading this highly popular and influential website): our lawyers** are coming for you.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Pride flags are a combinatorics problem</strong>
    <br><br>
    We rocked up in Dartford and decided to have a short walk around the town centre. Clearly we had nothing better to do than go on holiday to Dartford back then. 
    Dartford claims to be the home of Richard Trevithick, which at Nutty Trains, an organisation of the highest journalistic integrity, we are obligated to call this 
    out as fake news. Trevithick was a Camborne boy who went to the big city (Merthyr Tydfil) to make his fortune. Watch our video (link above) to see these false claims 
    <i>destroyed</i> by <i>facts</i> and <i>logic</i>.
    <br><br>
    Oh Christ, we've started wearing flatcaps. This never ends well.
