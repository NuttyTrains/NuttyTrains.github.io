    <strong>WELCOME TO THE CHRISTMAS AMNESIA ZONE!</strong>
    <br><br>
    Adventure 10: CHRISTMAAAAAS! For the first time in a number of adventures, I actually remember the existence of this one - wow! Even better, 
    I actually have a video to work from! Even more wow! Yet, past Matthew was right - I did not get around to writing this until 2024 (I thought I'd 
    give this one a shot whilst suffering with death, just like on this adventure). By this point, death aside, Matthew is very slowly improving... 
    right as James begins to suffer: welcome to a new stage of trauma! The rest of the videos here will never, ever see the light of day!

    The day started bright and early for James, and less so for Matthew, who was dying. The goal on this adventure was to make maximum usage of our 
    completely fucked tickets (which essentially allowed us unlimited travel in Kent for an entire weekend, which is truly crazy), and to make it to 
    Dover by the end of the evening. What could go wrong?

    Well it turns out that James' train to Paddington was the first thing to go wrong. It meant that the adventure itself did not exactly start bright 
    and early - James arrived at Imperial at just gone 10am, to find Matthew looking like a ghost dressed in a ushanka. Matthew had a particularly spicy 
    form of death and was genuinely not feeling good - it is actually a wonder that he survived 2 days in the freezing cold: the things we used to do for 
    content when we were still young and energetic is quite astonishing.

    The first order of the day was to head to St Pancras International, caffeinate Matthew, feed James, and catch the highspeed train! It was HS1 time, 
    which was very exciting.
