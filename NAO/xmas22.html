    <strong>WELCOME TO THE CHRISTMAS AMNESIA ZONE!</strong>
    <br><br>
    Adventure 10: CHRISTMAAAAAS! For the first time in a number of adventures, I actually remember the existence of this one - wow! Even better, 
    I actually have a video to work from! Even more wow! Yet, past Matthew was right - I did not get around to writing this until 2024 (I thought I'd 
    give this one a shot whilst suffering with death, just like on this adventure). By this point, death aside, Matthew is very slowly improving... 
    right as James begins to suffer: welcome to a new stage of trauma! The rest of the videos here will never, ever see the light of day!

    I need to go to college to collect my santa hat - it just depends on how long everything else takes

    I could meet you at IC? Or intercept you?<br>
    I assume you havent packed anything and am just doing it all this morning XD
    <br><br>
    <b>Matthew — 10/12/2022 09:00</b><br>
    Just packed everything now
    <br><br>
    <b>James — 10/12/2022 09:01</b><br>
    Go grab some toast and pack a bag and stop working!<br>
    This train is buying you a lovely amount of time XD

    The day started bright and early for James, and less so for Matthew, who was dying. The goal on this adventure was to make maximum usage of our 
    completely fucked tickets (which essentially allowed us unlimited travel in Kent for an entire weekend, which is truly crazy), and to make it to 
    Dover by the end of the evening. What could go wrong?
    <br><br>
    Well it turns out that James' train to Paddington was the first thing to go wrong. It meant that the adventure itself did not exactly start bright 
    and early - James arrived at Imperial at just gone 10am, to find Matthew looking like a ghost dressed in a ushanka. Matthew had a particularly spicy 
    form of death and was genuinely not feeling good - it is actually a wonder that he survived 2 days in the freezing cold: the things we used to do for 
    content when we were still young and energetic is quite astonishing. By southern standards, it was truly freezing that day.

    The first order of the day was to head to St Pancras International, caffeinate Matthew, feed James, and catch the highspeed train! It was HS1 time, 
    which was very exciting. St Pancras is a beautiful station, even though the anti-immigrant barbed wire that encloses the Eurostar trains in a cage is 
    somewhat of a eyesore. The Javelin highspeed trains were very cool to ride, even though we, from our far more worldly PoVs as PhD students, would scoff 
    at their rusticness now. In almost no time at all, we had zipped down the line, through the tunnel (avoiding East London), out into the marshes of the 
    Thames, and to Ebbsfleet. It was time to tick off some stations!
    <br><br>
    The next task was to disembark at Ebbsfleet 'International' (note to readers: all the signs were in French!), and then sail our way through the ocean of car parking spaces 
    until we finally reached 'civilisation' on the other shore. And my goodness, it was a glorious civilisation! We saw a small industrial estate, the world's most 
    dilapadated football stadium, and a dodgy roundabout where we were nearly run over by a car! Everyone, and I mean <i>everyone</i> needs to see the Golden Gri_l and 
    All-day Engllish Breakfast! What a glorious welcome to any potential international passengers disembarking in Good Old Blighty!
    <br><br>
    But why were we doing this? Perhaps it is now time to briefly consult the map.
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/maps/Ebbsfleet.png" width="25%"></center>
<p>
    As you can see here, the highspeed line bisects the slow line at Ebbsfleet 'International'. We intended to keep travelling east on the slow line (towards Chatham), and 
    we could indeed have just boarded a Javelin train from St Pancras that did exactly that. This would leave us in a bit of an unfortunate situation though: we had 
    <i>started</i> this line in London, reaching Dartford, but we would then have missed 4 annoying stations enroute. Therefore, we decided to walk to the nearby Northfleet, 
    double back to Dartford, and <i>then</i> proceed east to Chatham. Consequently, this was the ridiculous and convoluted plan that we decided upon, and this was what we 
    were now putting into action. (Meanwhile Matthew was genuinely dying - this was not fun).
    <br><br>
    I am actually writing this whilst watching the video (scroll up), A) because 
    it has been 2 years since this adventure so I don't remember anything, and B) I was clearly barely holding myself together into something that maybe passed for ¬a corpse, 
    so I don't think I <i>ever</i> remembered anything. I mention this because past James has reminded me of all the strikes taking place in 2022 - certainly an alien 
    concept to me now in 2024...

    <strong>Last year we brought you Christmas on a cliff. This year we bring you Christmas from the middle of a roundabout!</strong><br>
    <strong>This station doesn't deserve more use</strong>
    <br><br>
    Here, dear readers, I must inform you of something <strong>VERY IMPORTANT</strong>. Upon arriving at Northfleet station and admiring the concrete, pile of fags and 
    mountain of litter, we introduced a BRAND NEW, FULLY TRADEMARKED piece of CONTENT: <u>'Tasty Matthew Snack Time'<sup>TM</sup>, Patent Pending</u>. It has recently 
    come to our attention that <a href="https://nebula.tv/videos/jetlag-we-played-hide-and-seek-across-japan">certain upstart, copycat Youtube channels</a> have copied 
    this 100% original, artistically creative and trademarkable segment of content, where Matthew attempts to ingest cough syrup and instead spills it on himself. To 
    those copycat channels (which we know <i>will</i> be reading this highly popular and influential website): our lawyers** are coming for you.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Pride flags are a combinatorics problem</strong>
    <br><br>
    We rocked up in Dartford and decided to have a short walk around the town centre. Clearly we had nothing better to do than go on holiday to Dartford back then. 
    Dartford claims to be the home of Richard Trevithick, which at Nutty Trains, an organisation of the highest journalistic integrity, we are obligated to call this 
    out as fake news. Trevithick was a Camborne boy who went to the big city (Merthyr Tydfil) to make his fortune. Watch our video (link above) to see these false claims 
    <i>destroyed</i> by <i>facts</i> and <i>logic</i>.
    <br><br>
    Oh Christ, we've started wearing flatcaps. This never ends well. See the video.

    <br><br>
    We then apparently went to Rochester Castle's Christmas market (foreshadowing to Xmas 24??), then embarked upon a beautiful tour of Chatham - the Dead Pigeon pub, 
    the German maths school, Chatham's finest Khrushchevkas, and the statue of Lord Traffic Cone. Rest in peace, Lord Traffic Cone. This is Nutty Trains, so naturally 
    we did not visit Chatham historic docks<br>
    And that is the end of the video - you'll likely never see the rest of that footage ever.
    <br><br>
    -------------
    <br><br>
    We now unfortunately re-enter the amnesia zone, where recollections may vary, especially as the next port of call was getting drunk in some rough-looking pub. I don't 
    fully understand why we chose to do this, given we both feared for our health and safety. Perhaps we just needed a bit of courage for what we were about to do next.
    <br><br>
    The next train took us to Sittingbourne, where we changed to the Sheerness-on-Sea branch line, though I have little-to-no recollection of doing this. 
    Blissfully, until writing this account, I also had no recollection of that line either, but unfortunately this has jogged my memory somewhat. My word, that line 
    was something else. James had learned of this line from seeing a video about Swale station - probably the least used station in Kent, if I had to guess. This 
    entire line was pretty horrible, with its marshy, foggy landscape of industrial miscellany and council estates, but Swale was something else. Swale station consists 
    of a single rundown concrete platform, overshadowed by one of the most monstrously large road viaducts I have ever seen - it was genuinely pretty shocking. (Long-time 
    followers: think of the viaduct at Milford Haven, about which I was similarly shocked 5.5 years ago from the time of writing... yikes.) At NT, 
    we usually enjoy stations with questionable rationale for existence... but why the fuck does Swale exist? Whom does it seek to serve? <i>Surely</i> it is completely 
    pointless to have a station serve not a town, not a village, not a hamlet, but the underside of a viaduct? <i>Surely?</i>
    <br><br>
    I could repeat most of my arguments for Sheerness-on-Sea if I am being honest. It was pretty grim and miserable, and the cold temperatures, beige sea and fading 
    light did not help its case. I think we filmed some kind of monologue to camera in front of the beige sea. Unfortunately, you will never get to see any of that, and 
    I don't remember much else about this place. I look far too pleased with myself in the below photo - it must be the Dutch courage from earlier talking.

<p>
    Upon returning to Sittingbourne we continued our quest eastwards, skipping only 1 station on this line, and heading towards Margate. I truly remember nothing from 
    this point onwards. I think I was pretty exhausted and ill and cold, so perhaps this once my amnesia is forgiveable. Indeed, I think we spent the next hour doing 
    nothing but ticking stations off. I don't actually remember where we stopped for dinner. I had assumed we had Pizza Express, but I cannot shake the feeling that 
    we actually went somewhere quite nice, where James <i>finally</i> encouraged Matthew to spend money for once in his life... in <i>Broadstairs</i> of all places! 
    How very bizarre. The original intention had been to grab something to eat in Sandwich or Deal, either of which would have been very funny. Ah well.
    <br><br>
    We pulled into Dover Priory, through the tunnel under the white cliffs, and stepped out of the station... and then <i>slipped</i> out of the station. Yep, 
    everything was extremely icy, neither of us had shoes with grip, and James is extremely dyspraxic, so it is actually a real shame you'll never get to see this 
    footage - I am sure it would be comedy gold!
    <br><br>
    We slipped and slid our way up to the B&B after a majestic tour of Dover on ice, and checked in. Honestly? Castle House guest house was a really nice place - 
    would recommend!

<p>
    After a cooked breakfast in the morning, we set off to explore the historic town of Dover. Dover is home to a Roman fort, a mediaeval castle, a series of 
    tunnels and WW2 bunkers, as well as a lighthouse, a famous port and of course, the White Cliffs for which it is famous. Naturally, we were going to do 
    absolutely none of this. Matthew was too miserly to spend money entering Dover Castle, and James was too eager to move on to some trains, so we settled for 
    the next best source of British history and culture - a trip to Poundland, followed by sitting on the seawall in the icy rain. Doesn't that make you proud to 
    be British?
    <br><br>
    The railway system, not to be outdone in patriotism, decided upon the most British course of action that day... all trains stopped running. We knew already 
    that trains do not run in Autumn, due to leaves on the line, and we had learned during the heatwave earlier in the Summer that steel melts at 30°C, and wood 
    spontaneously combusts. Now we also knew that the moment that temperatures fall below 0°C, the rails ice up, and trains do not run either. The conclusion? Never 
    take trains unless it is Spring. Then only the strikes can affect you.
    <br><br>
    Stuck in Dover, we asked station staff if the ice would melt soon. They told us to take a bus.
    <br><br>
    -------------
    <br><br>
    Welcome instead to Nutty Buses! Roll the intro!
    <br><br>
    It was exceptionally rare to entice Matthew onto a non-London bus at the time - they scared him somewhat, after so many years of relative luxury. James was over the 
    moon at this news - now he could show Matthew the wonders of buses, as we trundled very slowly up the side of the White Cliffs, along the coast, and down the cliffs 
    once more into Folkestone, in the hopes of catching a train here. Credit where credit is due to that bus - that route climbed very steeply, and on an icy day too!
    <br><br>
    Alas, there were no trains from Folkestone either. Bugger. We decided to have an explore to kill some time. We admired the little park near the station, saw the 
    glorious town centre, and paid a mandatory visit to the local multi-storey car park, where I apparently attempted to butcher the Russian language on the roof of 
    the car park. We finally showed up at Folkestone bus station, and found that the only bus leaving reasonably soon was to Canterbury... via Dover. Oops.
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    Welcome back to Nutty Buses, this time with a full camera crew! We even provided them with their own refridgerated transport! We hope they packed oxygen! x

<p>
    That bus journey was really something. The 2 teenage girls sat next to us <i>did not stop talking</i> for the entire 90 minute journey. They were weirdly 
    interested in what we were up to - this always seems to happen to us when we get off the beaten track - including a steamed-up bus on the A20 to Canterbury 
    on a December morning.
    <br><br>
    By some fluke, we had ended up where we wanted to reach all along - Canterbury, another historic city, this time with 2 train stations, multiple town gates, a mediaeval 
    town centre, and of course, the famous Cathedral. Unfortunately I remember very little here - I am pretty certain we just walked straight through the city, had a 
    brief glance at the Cathedral from a distance, and headed straight to Canterbury West with absolutely 0 fanfare. We should start a guide tour business, because 
    our ability to see the sights in historic, beautiful, mediaeval towns and cities is quite frankly unparalleled. Finally, at long last, we had found a functioning 
    train line at Canterbury West, so at about 3pm, we hopped on our first train of the day. Not quite what we had intended, given we had wanted to finish most of Kent. 
    Oops.
    <br><br>
    The train headed to Ashford, where we disembarked and admired at how abandoned the whole place was. International services ceased to serve Ashford during the pandemic, 
    and even though I am writing this almost 5 years after the first case, international trains <i>still</i> do not call at this station. I wonder what it would look 
    like now...
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Ashford International.jpg" width="40%"></center>
<p>
    Finally, instead of gambling and potentially getting stranded by more ice, or mopping up some lines in SE London on slow trains, we decided to call it a day, and 
    took the Javelin train back to St Pancras. NT Xmas 22 had not been a resounding success, but at least this would never happen to us again, right? <i>Right?</i>
    <br><br>
    Merry Christmas, see you in our 2024 adventure!!
