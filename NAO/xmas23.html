    IT'S CHRISTMAAAAAAAS!
    <br><br>
    That is all.
    <br><br>
    Last Christmas stuck in Dover <br>
    We said we wouldn't do this again <br>
    This year to save us some tears <br>
    We avoided trains 'til Sunday <br><br>

    Last Christmas the rails iced up <br>
    but we went to folkstone anyway <br>
    This year to save us some tears <br>
    LNER will fuck us <br>

    <strong>WELCOME TO THE AMNESIA ZONE!</strong>
    <br><br>
	Adventure 15 marks the true beginning of the end - but also the end* of 2023, a year that was best forgotten. (Well, I say 'best forgotten', I mean 'a year that I 
    forgot': if I had remembered everything/had no reason to forget, then this wouldn't be the Anmesia Zone, would it?)

    We were now 3 months into our respective PhDs, in Exeter and Leeds, further apart from one another than at any point in the past. This was not good for NT - UK trains 
    are notoriously expensive, and the Crosscountry line connecting Leeds to Exeter is additionally notoriously slow, unpleasant and smelly. For these reasons (and many 
    others), NT had taken a post-France hiatus as we settled into research life. However, as the winter drew in, it was time to embark upon our Christmas tradition! We 
    elected to meet 'half-way', in a city that reminded us of Bath, to relive the origins of NT. Quite how I managed to swindle James into believing that Lincoln was 
    'half-way' between us, I do not know, but I am not complaining: we had a pretty good time despite the total lack of functioning trains!
    <br><br>
    Join us on this wine-soaked adventure to a pretty cathedral town in the Midlands, where we see the sights, drink the wine, admire the local cuisine, and only end up 
    taking a single train when it is time to get the hell out of there. After all, would it be a Christmas adventure if the trains were functioning?
