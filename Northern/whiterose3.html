It looks like the buses have screwed with me again: I think I'm going to miss my Huddersfield train
<br><br>

Ah. Bugger.

Let's meet at Lockwood on the next train (12:20-ish)

Noted...

I am going to try and make it to Huddersfield ASAP - provided the buses don't screw me more, I can get there for 11:21 (ironically, 2 minutes after the Lockwood/Sheffield train leaves)

They screwed with me again

<b>James — 23/03/2025 10:57</b><br>
The fucks happened now?
<br><br>
<b>Matthew — 23/03/2025 10:57</b><br>
I can't make that next Hudds train either. Hence, I shall catch the next one<br>
Naturally, it must take me at least 40 mins to get from my house to the station<br>
I am looking forward to next year when I'll be right next to the train line<br>
This is nonsense
