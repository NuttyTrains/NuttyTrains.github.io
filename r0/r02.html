	Get ready for a mask-wearing, socially-distanced foray to Cardiff, with video filming in IKEA thrown in! (Essential workers only, this is a pandemic, of course)
	<br><br>
	This time Matthew was ready to step on a train for the first time since late March, and so it was time for Nutty <i>Trains</i> to hit the rails once more! James 
	boarded the train in Swansea just before 10 o'clock, and then Matthew joined him at Neath at 10:06, armed with his double mask and complete lack of sanity. The train 
	was only a sprinter, but the carriage was fairly empty nonetheless. This particular class of sprinter is armed with a very large array of Kafkaesque announcements, 
	designed to instill the fear of God into the unsuspecting passenger. These included Welsh Government announcements, warnings about protecting the vulnerable from 
	Covid, congratulatory praise for NHS and essential workers, and frequent reminders that the trains were for essential workers only - NO NON-ESSENTIAL TRAVEL. Oops.
	<br><br>
	We decided to keep fairly quiet as the train made its way down through Port Talbot and Bridgend, as we took in the familiar sights on the route to Cardiff. To 
	Matthew, NT really feels like it comes alive when we head east, as that is the way the valleys lie, and countless nutty trips have been made there in summers and 
	other holidays in the past. As the draconian threats of death to all non-essential travellers continued unabated, we entered the city and pulled into the station - 
	we had arrived at last!
	<br><br>
	We disembarked from the train and were shoved around the socially-distanced station's new one-way system, until we finally found a staircase to take us into the 
	station's underground concourse and out through the ticket barriers into the city centre. James was distraught that the station's M&S was shut, but we carried on, 
	past the new BBC HQ and a person whom James absolutely didn't act REDACTED towards, walked through the middle of a busy road, and joined Cardiff's shopping centre. 
	We passed through one of the arcades which Matthew picked at random, but by sheer luck it happened to be the right choice, as the first stop of the day was located in 
	that very arcade - <a href="https://www.penandpaper.co.uk/">Pen & Paper</a>.
	<br><br>
	We entered the little shop, and started to wander around, albeit getting thoroughly confused by the one-way system that was in place (we were only reassured when one 
	of the employees, with a very thick Kaahdiff accent, was clearly ignoring the system). James was immediately enticed by the fountain pen display, as he was looking 
	for a second model, and the shop had a selection of small brands whom he'd never heard of before, and he was very impressed. Matthew meanwhile headed over to the 
	pencils section to get Freya something for her birthday. Matthew bought a few coloured pencils, some very soft black pencils and a charcoal stick for her, and even 
	managed to get a loyalty card at the shop, at long last. James meanwhile settled on a Abbey Autograph pen, which he was very pleased at both the quality and 
	the value for money. RIP.
	<br><br>
	We then decided to head for Queen Street. James led the way up towards Cardiff Market and Cardiff Castle... which was wrong. Matthew then led the way... somewhere... 
	and got slightly lost. This was also wrong. Matthew then finally remembered the correct route, past Primark, WHSmith and the Capital Shopping Centre, all the way to 
	Sainsbury's, where we went in and bought ourselves lunch and crisps for later.
	<br><br>
	James couldn't quite wait for lunchtime, so immediately brought out his drink of choice - a blue Innocent smoothie. Why had he chosen it? Well, it was blue! He gave 
	it a sip, and uttered the immortal line,<br>
	<strong>Mmm, that's... that's awful!<br>
	Awful is my word for amazing!</strong>
	<br><br>
	No matter how amazing the smoothie, he had to put it away when we reached Grangetown station, as we had to fumble for our tickets and put our masks on. The station 
	guard gave James a hard time for attempting to cross the ticket line without a mask (despite them only having been compulsory for 48 hours), but we eventually made 
	it up to the platform and got on our train to our next destination - Grangetown.
	<br><br>
	It had obviously been a long time since Matthew had been on a train, especially a train in Cardiff, as he seemed genuinely perplexed when the train curved its way 
	around the city centre and started approaching Cardiff Central. Had we just evaded the fares/tricked the ticket barriers? It certainly seemed we had! This was enough 
	to send Matthew into a fit of laughter, as we had not only managed to evade fares and trick the ticket barriers on a day when we weren't even yet allowed on public 
	transport to begin with, but we had managed to do so through sheer incompetance! Welcome to Nutty Trains, they say. Reckless, ill-planned and now illegal adventures, 
	coming soon during a pandemic near you!

	The trip down to Grangetown was mostly uneventful, but when we arrived at the station, we had reached our de facto terminus for the day. We all know the rules by now, 
	and we were hardly going to pass up an opportunity for a mask photo. Nwotegen: Tick!
</p>

<p> 
	We left the station and headed down the stairs, to the alleyway connecting the Ikea car park with the station, passing the dodgy car mechanics on the way. We felt 
	great about ourselves - this was just like old times! Walking through dodgy places in the middle of nowhere, with no real idea where we were headed... except this 
	time it was in Chocky times!
	<br><br>
	We crossed through the Ikea car park, only to find that all of our usual (1) entrances were blocked off by barriers in order to form a socially distanced queue. Damn 
	staff, always pandering to cars! Don't they ever spare a thought for the nutters who <i>walk</i> to Ikea? Nevertheless, we wandered our way around until we found an 
	entrance, slipped our way in and headed in the direction of the queue. We had to cross a few barriers to get to the end of the queue itself. Of course, we failed 
	miserably at this. Matthew decided to go under the barrier... right as James was stepping over it, thereby managing to hoist the chains straight into James's crotch...
	<br><br>
	We queued for the best part of 45 minutes, killing time standing in the car park. During this time, James revealed his true intentions for the continuation of our 
	#IKEAmeansIKEA trip, and hoisted a camera stand set out of his bag. James, as de facto head of MathSoc (and the only real mathematician there), had been selected to 
	film some of the award videos for their annual awards ceremony that Friday. Kind of. He had been given the envelopes with the names of the shortlists and winners, and 
	had been told to leave the sealed until Friday, when he would reveal the lucky winner via a Zoom call. Except, this being James, he was going to do nothing of the 
	sort. Using his poor internet as an excuse, he decided he would instead film himself reading out the award shortlists and winners beforehand, and send the videos to 
	the organiser of the ceremony... at the last minute, so that she wouldn't know the twist...
	<br><br>
	1 video was to be filmed in IKEA!
	<br><br>
	We eventually made it into the shop, ascended the escalator, and spent a few minutes searching for a trolley to place the camera equipment on. We climbed to the top 
	floor, went back down in the lift, found a trolley on the 1st floor, went back up in the lift, realised that we had left the lift on the wrong side of the one-way 
	system, went back down in the lift, went around to the other side of the lift and went back up to the top floor one last time. Finally, we had made it. We continued 
	down the path towards the displays, and immediately found a comfy, homely-looking sofa. This was a perfect filming location! Here, we would film the awards video! 
	We spent ages setting the camera stand up on the front of the trolley, adjusting the angle so that he could be captured both sitting down in his 'living room' (which 
	had a suspiciously large number of IKEA price tags attached), as well as walking down the aisle, when he would reveal to MathSoc that <s>he actually lives in IKEA</s> 
	it wasn't actually his living room, and that he was in IKEA. Unfortunately, this was harder than it seemed. Every time a staff member walked past, we would hide the 
	camera to make us seem less suspicious, and every few seconds more people would arrive, <i>actually shopping for stuff</i>. Disgraceful. When we finally managed to 
	get the entire clip on film without being interupted, his head was almost cut off the top of the film, the audio quality was terrible, and the entire thing was rushed 
	out of fear. James criticised Matthew for having no standards of decency, and Matthew laughed like a maniacal IPN. Nevertheless, a Plan B would have to be sought.

	Despite this being James's video, Matthew saw an opportunity to be nuts, and so rejected his sensible idea to film the video outside IKEA, or in the IKEA car park. 
	No, this video was to be filmed in the showroom, or we weren't worthy of the title IPN! We found a nice little desk tucked away in the office section of the showroom, 
	towards the back corner of the building. This was perfect! James sat down at the table whilst Matthew manoeuvered the filming trolley into position. Lights, Camera, 
	Action!
	<br><br>
	"Hello MathSoc, I am here to announce some of the 2020 Annual MathSoc Awards, and I'm definitely not filming this in IKEA!"<br>
	<i>(Lifts up conveniently placed IKEA mug in front of him, with price tag still attached)</i>

<p>
	With our primary mission accomplished (including the guest appearance of the tannoy and a baby screaming at the end), we headed downstairs with our still empty 
	trolley to fulfil our secondary mission - buying some useless random crap. Matthew spotted a dish mat, and decided this was a suitable start, even though it wasn't 
	particularly crap, as he might actually use it. James countered with a light-up house, made from luminous yellow plastic. This was undeniably random and crap. We 
	headed through the towering aisles of flatpack furniture, before arriving at our favourite section of the entire store - the bargain section! Here, Matthew bought a 
	discounted IKEA cookbook, despite being completely unable to cook any meals more complex than absolute basics, and James bought some <s>metal snowflake coasters</s>, 
	shurikens, meaning he won this round. We queued up, paid for our items, avoided the queue for the bistro and walked out, pleased with our veritable haul of shit.

	We then wandered up though Grangetown to a park, eventually found our way in through the seemingly sole gate, and sat down as far away from the screaming children 
	and REDACTED family playing cricket as possible. We ate our lunch, spotted a few trains on the nearby viaduct and admired our collection of shit, whilst also 
	discussing Matthew's family's recent 'Healthweek' initiative, whereby they were meant to become more healthy by improving their diets and doing more exercise... 
	without going out and doing any exercise, reducing portion sizes or cutting back on the chocolate and desserts everyday. James was rather gobsmacked by the portion 
	sizes and lack of greens that Matthew spoke of.
	<br><br>
	We then finished our lunch and walked back to Grangetown station, rather exhausted by our first train adventure in almost 6 months. Despite it being only 
	mid-afternoon, we returned to Cardiff Central and then caught the train home, ready for a longer train adventure to unexplored regions next time!
