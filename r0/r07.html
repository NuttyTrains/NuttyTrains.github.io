	STEEEEEAM TRAAAAAIN! We finally did it - we went on to Lydney and caught the Dean Forest Railway, and caught a steam train up and down the line! Along the way, 
	James had a terrible morning, and Matthew unexpectedly met Freya in Cardiff.
	<br><br>
	*Disclaimer: a lot of time has passed since this adventure, so this account may be patchier than the ones you are used to. Let's dive in!
	<br><br>
	What a way to close out the R<sub>0</sub>s! With Matthew imminently heading back to London, we calculated that we had time for perhaps one more R<sub>0</sub> 
	before the summer was over. Whilst we had wanted to spend that Saturday on a trip to Pilning (we will come back for you at some point, Pilning!), a different 
	opportunity presented itself - a trip on a heritage railway! Duly, we booked tickets to ride on a real steam train on the Dean Forest Railway, and tick off 
	something that neither of us had done for years and years. The Dean Forest Railway (DFR) actually connects to the mainline at Lydney, and in non-chocky times you 
	can hop straight off the train and get on the steam train up the branch line. Unfortunately however, and as you have probably guessed by this point, all the 
	R<sub>0</sub> adventures <i>were</i> in chock times, so our journey on this adventure would involve a long, brisk and potentially complicated/dangerous walk 
	all the way to the DFR depot at Norchard to check in there. Add to this TfW fucking us over with a 2-hourly service, and you arrive at our stupid and complicated 
	journey plan for this adventure. Nevertheless, all that it required was for all the preceding transport links to work perfectly! What could go wrong?

	<i>Welcome everyone to the 'How to derail an NT adventure' conference. I will be your host today, Dai the Drive. Today, we will be running through our plan to completely 
	fuck James over and prevent him from catching his train. No need to worry about Matthew - he takes care of himself by being late to everything, all the time. Let's 
	get started then!</i>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Step 1: I, Dai the Drive, shall completely fuck James over right from the start. I shall drive the 111 to Swansea, and ensure that I am not only late, 
		ill-tempered and drunk, but that at every single stop from James' house to Swansea, I shall get off and have a fag. After this, I will take only the 
		busiest roads to slow the bus down to below walking pace, so that James does a Matthew and decides it would be quicker to run up the hill instead of stay 
		on the bus.
	</li>
    <li>Step 2: Then you, the other Dai the Drive, will be driving the "faster" bus that James attempts to catch after he gets fed up of mine. You must ensure 
		that you are half an hour late, and show up smoking cwâc. Between the 2 of us, we will delay James so much that he not only misses his train, but misses 
		the next one and has to leg it to the one after.
	</li>
    <li>Step 3: And this is where you, Dave the train manager come in. You must ensure that the 0923 that James has absolutely killed himself to catch must then 
		completely shit itself and break down as it attempts to leave. Your train has to completely collapse. This will cause James to tear his hair out. If you can 
		make the train catch fire and take out some chavs/half of Swansea at the same time, then that is an added bonus.
	</li>
    <li>Step 4: And finally, Dai the station announcer, just to top it all off, when James gets on his replacement train, announce it as a "Great Western Trains" 
		service, to make James think he has lost his mind. Reality is an illusion, the universe is a hologram, buy toilet roll!
	</li>
  </ul>

<p>
	Nonetheless, after this plan had been executed to perfection, some rejigging of our plans (again) meant that we could still make it to Lydney on time, and 
	just about catch the steam train. James' 800 accelerated like Matthew going to a morning lecture, and soon enough Matthew was picked up at Neath (who had for 
	once in his life been early - what are the odds?), and we were on our way!

<p>
	Before too long at all, we had arrived in Cardiff and now had plenty of time to kill before TfW's magical mystery train turned up on its 2 hour schedule, 
	now that TfW had cancelled every single really useful engine ever (apart from Jezza and the pacers - RIP). For this reason, we headed out into Cardiff to kill 
	some time.
	<br><br>
	It was not very long at all before we happened to bump into Freya's mum, to Matthew's utter horror. Having put great effort into trying to convince Freya's mum that 
	he was not a trainspotter, and that NT did not do stuff like this, the one and only time we ran into her, we were doing exactly that. Fuck my life.
	<br><br>
	We then waited around with Freya's mum and waited for Freya's family to assemble at their nominated meeting point, one-by-one, by the statue of Aneurin Bevan on 
	Queen Street. Everyone turned up at the correct time... except Freya. Freya was lost. Again. After, what seemed like an excuciatingly long time, Freya decided that 
	to turn up was probably a good idea. She eventually found her way to the meeting point, using Pokemon Go. Freya walked up with her nose still stuck in that game, and 
	glanced up at Matthew, then back to her phone, to catch a Pidgee. She stood there with one finger in the air to command us to wait for her Pidgee to be caught. Time and 
	time again, she threw that Masterball but to no avail, that Pidgee was as bad a crackhead, it didn't want to be caught. 
	<br><br>
	Once the Pidgee had been dealt with, she glanced up briefly and painfully withdrew from her pixellated reality, and was enormously surprised (well not really, as she noticed 
	him but she was too busy with Pokemon Go to register him) to discover Matthew there in Cardiff, completely unannounced. We all walked, extremely slowly, back towards Cardiff 
	Central, as Freya and her family were now heading home. Then, in the middle of the street, unannounced Freya and her family just stopped, for no apparent reason and so we all  
	stood there for half an hour while Matthew and Freya had a moment and James stood there awkwardly, reminded how blindingly single he was. Meanwhile Matthew was also despairing 
	about how lost Freya was going to get in London in just a few weeks time, he said this about five different times in his Matthew to Freya voice (miraculously though, this never 
	happened, and Freya is now better at navigating in London than she is in Wales). 
	<br><br>
	After this surprise meeting, we split up, killed a little more time in Cardiff city centre, before heading to the train station ourselves, for just gone 12. We realised that the 
	next train wasn't for 30 minutes and so we decided to look at other options. Still, with Pilning in our sights we eyed up a Crosscountry service to Gloucester, that would leave 
	earlier, but would probably make us miss the steam train. We considered this for a while before deciding to go over to the end of the playform and look at the old spindly metal bike, 
	much like one Matthew's Father had and James now has in Oxford. We also stood and <s>spat at</s> watched the trainspotters, using the railways as entertainment? Disgraceful, Imagine 
	doing that, you must be really sad. We then spotted a #DefinitelyAHST and avoided a train photographer (oh the irony), and then got on our train to Lydney, passing a random steam train 
	express on the way out of the station - how weird!

<p>
	We were sitting on the train to Lydney, eating our Lunch when out of a silent train, with only a few murmurs and cheers from the English heading to the English border
	we heard a stark cry,</p>
	<blockquote>WHO'S A PRETTY BOI THEN? <br>WHO'S A PRETTY BOI THEN <br> OI MUSH, FACK OFF</blockquote>
<p>
	What on earth was that? It sounded like an old lady having some shoved up her arse. We heard the same sequence but less clear this time as the murmur had risen from people 
	hearing the stark cry. James looked over his shoulder and saw what he assumes was once a red parrot, however, the parrot had seemed to have plucked most of it's feathers out 
	and had eaten them <b>mmmm, yummy</b>. He knew it was red though, as there was a a few feathers left making a hemisphere on the top of it's head. Just to confirm a few second 
	later a shrill stark cry rang and the parrot coughed, chocked and vomited up a few red feathers onto the floor of the train, at which point the train manager was walking past and 
	pressed the big red COVID-19 button on her langyard. At which point, machine guns instantly efficiently targetted the parrot, right on one of the lower hanging feathers from it's 
	head. At this point, what seemed like a SWAT team crashed through the sprinter windows. I would like to remind the reader that this a third world dictatorship run by our lord and 
	saviour Markey Drakey.   
	<br><br>
	*Cut to shot of James in Room Pwmp*<br>
	"Is that good Markey?", James emplored as the muffled face on the screen examined the work strewn infront of him, "Well," said Markey, "You did try to escape several times, nearly 
	got chocked by a parrot and [REDACTED]. I think you did a good job of screwing everything up. Do you love me?". James shudders in the seat in which he is sat as Markey reveals his 
	face, he beats on the restraints holding his arms, legs and face in place. Markey stares with stone cold teddy bear eyes and mutters something with a lot of 'w', 'll' and 'y''s. James 
	sees the audible amount of spit leaving Markeys mouth, James knows where this is going. James is unhanded and dragged kicking and screaming about how much he loves Markey. He feels a 
	sharp pain in his neck. <br><br>
	James wakes up in a tall mottled room with long thin windows many feet above him. James' head throbs and not in the usual way. He tries to sit up and chains clang and is chucked back to 
	the floor. James hears rumbling, from the next room. Almost a stampede. At the corner of his vision, he notices a door, start to slowly slide up. He can hear the mumurs, "No, No, not this",
	he pleads, "Markey, Markey, I love you Markey, please, not this. Anything". A booming voice encapsulates the room, again speaing in an incomprehsive foreign "script". The door moves faster,
	as James' heart beats, he can hear it in his ears and feel it in his eyes. James hears a more familiar script, but this one only meant one thing. He hears a characters and pinyin amalgamated
	and is reminded of Beta3, they sound almost sounded the same. The door was finally relieve and they came running. Holding their cameras, selfie sticks and gucci bags. You may think these were 
	a horde of Hollie Jones, but Markey is cruel mistress and he said James one fear. 中国人. And as the screams subsided, James pleaded and pleaded for the flashes to stop and the uttered script to 
	be releaved from his ears. He told them '我的中文不好' and sung the song to releave his pain, but it was too little. James loved Markey with all of his sole. Blwdda Wyne James. 
	<br><br>
	After the session was complete, James appeard out of the Nazi town hall in Newport and and soon we had arrived in Lydney - a fairly quiet station in the middle of what seemed like nowhere, deep 
	in the greenery to the south of the town itself. Nonetheless, we had a limited amount of time to get to the DFR at Norchard, so we set off in a hurry, walking along 
	the roads until we peeled off down a footpath towards the town playing fields.
	<br><br>
	Lydney had a really nice English countryside feel to it. It was a really pleasant little town, complete with village green, village lake, and a lovely village 
	high street. We walked alongside the lake, before turning off over a twee little bridge, passed the playing fields as a game of cricket was in progress, and saw 
	the steam train pass through the middle of the village high street on our way through. It was so nice that James said he would have happily lived there, were 
	it not norrrth o' thar Tamar, ooh arrgh!
	<br><br>
	After this we headed up a quiet residential street, passing an old apple tree and a line of houses just in front of the railway line, before we and the road then 
	disappeared into the forest, all the way to Norchard. This really, really was not a journey meant to be done by foot - perhaps James' suggestion of a taxi wasn't 
	a bad idea after all! However, before long, we had arrived in the station car park, and with 20 minutes to spare as well! Lovely Jubbly!
	<br><br>
	We checked in at the station entrance, and then joined the queue for the train itself at Norchard Low Level station. The whole set up there was really very lovely - 
	the old station infrastructure had all been restored, all the staff were in classic uniforms, vintage signs absolutely littered the place, there were old codgers 
	working on the even older engines in the sidings, and to top it all off, the station master sang an amusing social distancing song whilst we queued on the platform! 
	You really couldn't ask for any more!
	<br><br>
	Eventually we were shown to our seats on the carriage, and we sat down and took our masks off, and waited for the train to depart.
	<br><br>
	The train shortly set off, puffing into life, and chuffed its way down the line, blowing clouds of white smoke into the summer sky and we twisted our way through 
	the green countryside, passing this sheep:

<p>
	(Disclaimer: sheep not included)
	<br><br>
	Unfortunately, because of Covid, this train was not able to stop at every station on the line, so we were unable to tick them all off on the way. Fortunately though, 
	this gives us an excuse to go back one day! Optime!
	<br><br>
	Nevertheless, we did slow down at every station, and were able to see all the lucky bastards who lived in the old station masters' cottages at each halt, and were 
	out in their gardens, waving at the train as it went past.
	<br><br>
	Eventually we arrived at Parkend, the final stop on the line (for now - they do have a line extension programme underway though). We were all allowed to disembark to 
	watch the engine decouple from the front of the train, rewater, reverse down the other line, and couple up with the other end of the train. We took this chance to get 
	our station sign photo, explore the carriages and old station building, and head up to the bridge in order to watch the locomotive complete all of its procedures and 
	recouple to the other end of the train, ready for the return journey. It was a really nice experience at Parkend.
	<br><br>
	We then zipped down the entire line, straight through Norchard, and into Lydney town centre itself. Once again, in non-chock times, it is possible to just hop onto the 
	train from the town centre itself, which will be a fun way to enjoy the beautiful town centre itself, when we inevitably go back to the DFR on a future Sampi. 
	<br><br>
	As we passed through Lydney, all along the train's route, children and adults alike stopped to wave at the train as it went past, and nowhere was this more true than 
	when we passed through the town centre and through Lydney Town ¬station. It all felt extremely wholesome - very unusual for an NT adventure in progress!
	<br><br>
	We left the town centre, headed back into the greenery for a mile and a bit, and before long had arrived at the other end of the line - Lydney Junction, just around 
	the corner from the mainline station. Here, the train stopped for everyone to admire it, before once again switching ends like it had done at Parkend.
	<br><br>
	At this station, everyone from the entire train disembarked and we spent our time photographing and filming the old-timey carriages from the inside, including long 
	corridor shots and shots from inside the little compartments. It was very similar to the Hogwarts Express in Harry Potter, on the inside.
	<br><br>
	We also disembarked to get shots of the station, the engine moving to the front of the train, and even had our photo <i>taken by someone else</i> in front of the 
	station sign - what a luxury!
	<br><br>
	We then got back on the train and headed back to Norchard, once again waving back at all the children and grandparents who were waving at us on the train as we passed.

	Once back at Norchard, we disembarked, left a donation after a lovely day out, and headed to the Low Level station building/cafe to buy a cup of tea and have a sit 
	down. Whilst it was no cream tea, it was good enough. After a brief wander around the station museum and gift shop, we then headed back to the town centre and the 
	mainline to catch a train back to Cardiff.
	<br><br>
	We reached the town centre after a much more leisurely return walk, reminiscing about what a fantastic day out it had been (and that is rare on an NT adventure - 
	by this point we are usually standing in the pissing rain in some Godforsaken hellhole, with a starving and angry James) when the next steam train approached us 
	from behind just as we crossed the High Street. Just as others had waved at us, we waved at the train as it passed, and all seemed right with the world - 
	<strong>'God I can't wait to be old!'</strong>
	<br><br>
	We followed the walking trail alongside the railway, ticking off 2 ¬stations on foot along the way - the lovely Lydney Town, and the abandoned St Mary's Halt, which 
	we explored for a prolonged period of time, going up and down the footbridge between the disused platforms, waving at the train once more at it returned past us to 
	Norchard. Finally, we walked all the way to the mainline station, just around the corner from Lydney Junction, and waited for our (surprise, surprise) delayed TfW 
	train to Cardiff. Round of applause, TfW. Round of fucking applause.
	<br><br>
	Once back in Cardiff, we headed to our perennial favourite, Pizza Express, as there was simply no alternative to end such a great adventure, and a great summer of 
	adventures, despite First Cymru's best efforts to derail this adventure, and chock's best efforts to derail NT entirely.
	<br><br>
	Continuing our tour of Cardiff's Pizza Expresses, we headed to the restaurant just off the very busy St Mary St, which was absolutely rammed with drunken pubgoers, 
	enough to scare James half to death. Once inside though, it was very quiet, and we were free to work out how on earth to order using the app in peace. We both ended 
	up celebrating this classic adventure with classic pizzas - Matthew had his new favourite Pollo Ad Astra, and James had his classic superhot rectangular Calabrese - 
	'because quadrilaterals > circles'. 
	<br><br>
	We had our pizzas, paid, headed back to the station, and headed home. With the minor blip of James then being offered cwâc outside Swansea station on his way home, 
	it had been a fantastic adventure and a great end to the R<sub>0</sub> adventures!
