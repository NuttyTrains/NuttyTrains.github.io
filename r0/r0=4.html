	Being abandoned in a tiny rural village with only 2 trains a day, no sense of direction, a quest to find white woolly deer, a bunch of Karens and some illegal 
	heat? What a perfect idea!
	<br><br>
	It was time to head west yet again, out into the pristine countryside once more, to Londoner Matthew's utter dismay. James had been banned from visiting both Cardiff 
	and Swansea thanks to the chock, and missed the clean and beautiful countryside, so was determined to head west. We had a choice between visiting the Pembrokeshire 
	coast, or some random village on the HoW line, but because of the predicted thunderstorm and Thatcherite Matthew's newly-rekindled revulsion of buses, it was off to 
	mid Wales!
	<br><br>
	As we had discovered in 2019, there are not many trains that travel up HoW, so unlike most of our adventures, this one started at a very reasonable time in the 
	morning - Matthew didn't even have to run to the station! This was fortunate, as James was hungover, and absolutely needed the extra time to stagger down to 
	the bus, and go on a magical mystery tour of the chock-filled Gowerton council estate. Fantasteg!
	<br><br>
	James eventually arrived at the station, just minutes before the train arrived, having thought he would miss it. Unfortunately, whilst on the platform, he met 
	a group of Karens loudly chattering in the way that Karens do. Even worse, they were headed to Llandeilo, just like us. We decided to stay the fuck away from 
	them. The train made its way to Llanelli, at which point what seemed like the entire train disembarked, waiting to board the HoW train. We stayed far away from 
	those plebs, at the other end of the platform. We eventually boarded our clackety, clapped-out Sprinter, and the train started moving up the line. Just like we 
	always do on these trains, we admired the view out of the rattling windows as the entire train threatened to fall apart underneath us. Still, could be worse - 
	we passed the site of a recent train derailment and oil spillage. Weirdly, it kind of reminded Matthew of passing the nuclear reactors at Lydney. Yummy yummy 
	carcinogens! Matthew also spent much of the first few stations tracking what appeared to be a parallel line to ours (which turned out to be the Swansea District).
	<br><br>
	Most of the journey up was very lovely - it was nice taking our time travelling along the line without jumping on and off, despite the ramping heat. James was 
	enamoured by the little villages and rolling fields, whilst Matthew looked out at the Martian-equivalent landscape of smog-free <i>green</i> with fear.
	<br><br>
	As we passed Pontarddulais, the temperature was now significant, and Matthew relocated to the shaded half of the train, followed by James, as we sought refuge 
	from the glare of the sun. James opened the slammy windows for some circulation. It was at this point that a wasp entered the train and flew around, pestering 
	us for absolutely ages, flying all around us. Bleddy Wasp! Shortly after we had dispatched the first wasp, we were met by another! This one was even more annoying 
	than the last!<br>
	James: <strong>"This'll be the bliddy wasp adventure in a minute!"</strong>
	<br><br>
	It was eventually our station, Ffairfach, so we disembarked and watched the train recede into the distance. Ffairfach was a lovely little shaded station, and one 
	of the few request stops we had missed in <a href="../sampi.html">Sampi 3</a>. It had a level crossing at one end, and some strange street lamps illuminating the 
	station at night. We saw a trainspotter disembark from the train at the same time as us to photograph the departing DMU and we absolutely did not do the same 
	#notwritingdownnumbers. We seemed rather confused by the gentleman, who seemed as lost here as we were. Nevertheless, as this was effectively our terminus, it 
	was time for our picture:
</p>
	<center><img src="../resources/photos/Ffairfach.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	Ffairfach is a very small village which we had believed to be in absolutely the middle of nowhere. We set off left along the pavement of the main (and almost 
	only) road through the village to investigate what seemed to be some sort of mill building with a massive chimney (it was some sort of local bakery if 
	memory serves me correctly), before doing a 180 and walking towards Llandeilo. Along the way, we complained about the mounting heat, and discussed "Drunk NT". 
	Fortunately, Matthew illustrated that this would be a terrible idea by lurching out onto the road drunkenly, whilst completely sober... and then we almost 
	were run over by a massive truck.
	<br><br>
	After only 5 minutes spent in our destination, we had already reached the edge of the village. Surely this must be some sort of record for 'least amount of time 
	spent at intended destination' or something. We immediately set about climbing the enormous viaduct crossing the Towy into Llandeilo. Upon realising that 
	Llandeilo and Ffairfach were in fact contiguous, Matthew was deeply upset. <br>
	Matthew: Why the fuck does TfW have 2 stations in Llandeilo? Ffairfach doesn't <i>deserve</i> its own station! It ought to be called 'Llandeilo South' or something! <br>
	James: <i>I don't know!!</i> <br>
	Nevertheless, we were now in Llandeilo, so it was time for James to put on his best Menna impression and impress the locals! James liked the sign "Afon Towi" on 
	the bridge over the river, so just started screaming "AFON TOWI" at the signpost... because funny.
</p>

<p>
	We climbed the very steep (albeit pretty) hill into the town, attempting at all times to stay in the shade, which Matthew intepreted as "run to stay in the shade 
	of the passing lorry", almost killing James in the process. Fortunately, at the top of the hill we reached the narrower streets of the town centre, and set out 
	trying to find somewhere to eat. This, however, was a problem, as Matthew refused to actually spend money. O me miserum! So instead of actually having something 
	nice to eat in one of the innumerable sweet cafes and restaurants lining the streets, we instead trekked down the hill to the supermarket, and bought some bread 
	rolls. Never let it be said that Matthew doesn't know how to celebrate an occasion! Having said that, the supermarket was beautifully cool - we stayed twice as 
	long just to enjoy the air conditioning!
	<br><br>
	We walked up yet another hill, passing a "Cave Canem" mosaic on someone's door, taken directly from CLC, before eventually reaching Penlan Park. We climbed to the 
	top of the hill, found a bench in the shade, and enjoyed our bread rolls. For about an hour, James explained to Matthew all about hashing and his history of hashing, 
	right back to the hash he did in Cambridge. Hashing really is James's sport - it is energetic, completely bats, and he gets utterly sozzled every morning - what's 
	not to like? We continued to sit there after we had finished our lunch, in the forlorn hope that the heat of the day would pass soon, and spent some of the 
	intervening time being attacked by yet another wasp - this really was the bleddy wasp adventure!
	<br><br>
	After that, we wandered over to the vantage point, to look over Llandeilo and Ffairfach, and could see for miles. If the weather wasn't so terribly hot, it 
	would have been a beautiful day. But, unfortunately, it was, so we retreated back to the shade, and made our way down the hill along twisted shady paths, looking for 
	and entrance to our intended destination (Dinefwr Park), which bordered the park. Finding no entrance, we made our way to the exit and instead walked along the 
	road to the main entrance.
	<br><br>
	Dinefwr Park had in fact always been our intended destination. After James was forbidden from visiting either of the "big cities", his mum had suggested that we 
	visit somewhere nice and rural... like Dinefwr Park - it had a castle, plenty of green, and some deer! Lots and lots of deer. James had to see the deer. He had 
	to take many pictures of the many deer that were here in the park. Deer. Park. Pictures. Fun. "Have a good time Jamie!".
	<br><br>
	Ha. Ha. Ha.
	<br><br>
	Yet instead, here we were, walking alongside a road in the blazing sun, with no pavement to protect us from being run over, no shade to protect us from the sun, 
	and nothing to protect us from the chock. We ran across the road to the other side, in front of the oncoming traffic, so as to stay on a grassy verge and not have 
	to walk on the tarmac itself. We then spent the next 10 minutes trying to outrun a lawnmower as the path undulated up and down, all whilst the sun beat down upon us, 
	the temperature rose, and we became more feverish. The temperature was now "illegally hot".<br>
	James: Matthew, why on earth did you bring your coat today?<br>
	Matthew: I learned my lessons from before - the weather said it would rain, so I brought my coat!<br>
	James: But Matthew, it is the hottest day of the year!<br>
	Matthew: Oh really? I hadn't noticed!
	<br><br>
	Eventually we returned to the road and the shade, having outpaced the lawnmower, and were crippled by exhaustion. Yet, in the name of seeing some deer, we pressed on. 
	We passed through a gate, and tracked down through a large field, avoiding the many piles of droppings. Yet it was here that we saw something amazing - a whole flock 
	of very rare white, woolly deer! James's Mum had been right all along! There were dozens, if not close to 100 of these white woolly deer! Such a sight had never before 
	graced our eyes! We went up very close and took pictures, whilst James started calling to the deer to entice them over:<br>
	James: BAAAAAAAAAA
</p>
	<center><video width="40%" controls><source src="../resources/video/White Woolly Deer.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>
<p>
	We walked all the way to the end of the field, at which point the ruined castle came into view, looming over the valley, shrouded in thick overgrowth. The path onwards 
	to the castle winded its way into the thick forest ahead of us, all but disappearing. Unfortunately, the time until our train departed was also disappearing, so we 
	decided at this point to turn back, back past the deer, back through the field, and back to the shaded road. We decided this time to walk directly along the road, as 
	it was simply too hot to walk in the sun. Despite the heat, we walked very quickly, as we not only had to make it all the way to the town, but we wanted to return to 
	the supermarket to buy water, all before finding the station. Matthew, as always, proposed that we ran, but James said he'd rather take a bus than run in this weather.
	<br><br>
	We walked briskly out of the park, back into town (making fun of Welsh on the way), and went into the air-conditioned supermarket once more to buy some water. On the 
	entire journey there, Matthew fretted about whether or not the station had ticket barriers - to save himself a few quid, he only had a ticket to Ffairfach, so he 
	was very worried that he'd be stranded out in the middle of nowhere, unable to board the train. James eventually reassured Matthew by finding a Google Maps view of 
	the station, after which, Matthew calmed down. After this, we passed a group of <i>children</i>, and then set off in search of the station. James brought out his 
	phone, put on his Menna accent, and spent the ensuing 5 minutes yelling at his phone for directions to "CHLLAN-DAI-LO". Unfortunately, the phone couldn't speak Menna.
	<br><br>
	After getting only slightly lost in a few twisty residential streets and cul-de-sacs, we arrived at the station at the arse end of the town, walked over to the shelter, 
	and rested away from the sun, glaring at the gang of youths nearby, and praying that the Karens from earlier were left behind. The last thing we did before leaving was 
	to have our obligatory photo, looking far more bedraggled and sweaty than we had done before:
</p>
	<center><img src="../resources/photos/Llandeilo.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	The train arrived, and we boarded our sprinter in SWR livery: "Jezza"! We sat down, and started to make our way home, as we were exhausted. This was yet another 
	section of railway that Matthew had semi-accidentally managed to fare-dodge in just a few days. Yay.
	<br><br>
	But that wasn't quite the end. It was only 3PM - how on earth were we already thinking about going home? This couldn't possibly be! By the time we were passing 
	Ammanford, and the temperature was dropping, we felt like we should do something else to extend the adventure. After ruling out Llanelli and Carmarthen, we 
	decided to head for Gowerton, where James could show Matthew all the sights in glorious technicolour!
	<br><br>
	There was one last shock on the way home. As we approached Bynea, the last missing station on the first section of the HoW line, the train started to slow down. 
	Wait, could it be? Would we be able to tick off our first station, done in proper NT hop-off, hop-on style?
	<br><br>
	YES! The train stopped, and Matthew and James leapt off to catch a photo of the station sign (and for once, Matthew was on camera duty!). At last, a proper station. 
	TICK!
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Bynea.jpg" width="40%"></center>
<p>
	We later arrived in Gowerton, disembarked and walked up to the main road. James wanted to tell Matthew about his time in Gowerton School, and reminisce about 
	Ffynone and pre-Covid, so that is exactly what we did for over an hour. We walked down the cycle path towards Swansea, making it halfway to Waunarlwydd before 
	doubling back on ourselves, James not wanting to accidentally end up in Swansea and defy his no-city order. Instead, we went up back to the town, and wandered 
	around various streets, passing his old school, where he pointed out where his favourite (and least favourite) places there were, passing houses of old friends, 
	and passing various other places he remembered vividly, before joining Ffynone. He also told Matthew about all his old friends.
	<br><br>
	Eventually we made our way back to the station and sat on the station wall, waiting for the train, talking about cliques in Ffynone. The train arrived, and 
	Matthew headed home, whilst James waited for his bus.
	<br><br>
	As an unexpected addendum, Matthew met Freya and 3 of his college friends that evening, completely out of the blue. So despite the heat, it turned out to be 
	an excellent adventure.
