	Getting tipsy in a pub next to a castle in the pouring rain? This seems like perfectly normal behaviour!
</p>
<p>
	After our escapade to Cardiff, "the big city", according to Mrs Arthur, James was now banned from any further adventures to the east for the time being, and this 
	included Swansea. Therefore, from now on, our R0 adventures would have to be West Wales adventures, to James's delight. This meant Matthew would have to catch an 
	earlier train than James, which would be... interesting, given Matthew's known perfect punctuality.
	<br><br>
	Nevertheless, Matthew actually arrived at the station just about on time (despite setting off late), collected his tickets from the machine, passed through the ticket 
	barrier and sprinted over the bridge and onto the other platform, making it onto the train with about 10 seconds to spare. He then sat on the train until it reached 
	Swansea, reading his book (by Michael Collins). 
	<br><br>
	The train pulled into Swansea, where Matthew stretched his legs, wandering up and down the island platform. Here, he spotted the fabled SWR TfW train - a sprinter 
	which TfW nicked from SWR, kept the livery and stuck a TfW logo on the side. Fantasteg. The train was definitely not stolen. Absolutely not. We would later nickname 
	this train "Jezza", and Jezza managed to appear in a great number of our adventures after this. Sadly, today we were unable to travel on Jezza, but fortunately the 
	Milford Haven train (which we were taking to Carmarthen) had a number of interesting passengers, including 2 Chinese tourists and a "fat bloke who fills half the 
	carriage" - Matthew, 2K2X.
	<br><br>
	James, meanwhile was rushing to try and make his very tight (-1 minute) connection from his bus to Gowerton station, and there was such a high chance he wouldn't 
	make it that Matthew was prepared to leave the train. Luckily, when the train pulled into the platform, James was waiting there, and the nuttiness could begin!

	Heading west for the first time in 11 months was exciting for both James and Matthew, especially considering that our only trip west had been Sampi 6, in which we 
	rattled through all 3 branch lines in a single outing. For the first time, we could actually choose the destinations we wanted to explore, rather than be stuck in 
	the shitty termini. Before long, the train was pulling into Carmarthen, where, thanks to chock, we would have to wait for our connection, as only Milford Haven trains 
	passed through the town without terminating. Annoyingly, we would discover that there always seemed to be a 1 hour time delay between the Milford Haven trains and 
	the Pembroke Dock trains, meaning plenty of waiting about.
	<br><br>
	We headed into the town, across the bridge, through the bus station, and into the town centre. We had a wander around for a bit, before heading into M&S for some 
	crisps, as our tradition dictates. Matthew bought the classic Salt and Vinegar, and James tried out Sweet Chili. James paid, to get the discounted price for the 2 
	bags, but was disdainful of Matthew's attempts to pay him back in "chockbits" (coins). After getting slightly lost behind the shop, we then went to Coffee#1 and had 
	tea and coffee to wake ourselves up. Matthew had the special Ceylon (which had bergamot in and was floral) and James had a coffee. Matthew's tea came in a tea pouch, 
	to his great amusement. He spent quite a few minutes standing by the bin, removing the tea pouch from the tea and photographing it for Freya, whilst James became 
	increasingly anxious as the chock police with their foam chock batons, closed in to take us to Room 5. We then headed leisurely back to the station, as we still 
	had time to kill.
	<br><br>
	Carmarthen station was guarded by 2 security people, whom we'd encounter every time we left the station over the summer. During this adventure though, they were far 
	more concerned about compliance with covid regulations than they were with people actually paying their fares. MASKS ON! We dithered between the platforms, switching 
	back and forth, whilst also laughing at the shitty rolling stock that was pulling into the station. We crossed over to the other platform and boarded our train at the 
	one entrance (out of 4) which hadn't been taped off. Mmm. Social distancey. 
	<br><br>
	The train pulled off towards Tenby, and we were on our way! Admittedly, we spent most of the journey on the way down sharing memes, as we'd already been through 
	this section of the line, and thanks to chock, we couldn't jump on and off even if we wanted to. Cue plenty of Mao and Xi memes, mangoes and sparrows from James, 
	which Matthew countered with Australian Star Wars election posters. All of them, however, pale in comparison to this, which Matthew pulled out as his ace:
</p>

<p>
	After passing Tenby, the army shooting ranges at Penally, and the campsite straddling the railway near Manorbier, we finally arrived at the penultimate stop on the 
	line, Pembroke, where we alighted to find a very nicely decorated single-platform station. We wandered down through the car park, and crossed under the railway 
	bridge, before running across a junction leading onto a blind bend, screaming "run me over 'en", to the utter shock of the 2 chinese tourists we'd met in Swansea, 
	and had followed our route ever since. They were our fwiends!
	<br><br>
	We wandered into the town centre, keeping our eyes peeled for pubs participating in Rishi's 'Eat out to help out' scheme, cafes, or even just shops to grab some 
	lunch. We were, however left bitterly disappointed. There seemed to be nothing there at all! Fortunately, at the last moment, as we entered the touristy street 
	leading to the castle, we found a fish and chip shop (Rowlies), and bought some fish and chips, before heading down to the river/moat to sit in the beer garden and 
	enjoy them. In the rain. Oh, what a wonderful British summer extravaganza! Sitting eating fish and chips in the pouring rain, in a beer garden over an algae-filled 
	castle moat. Pure, unadulterated bliss. We talked about how this kind of thing never happens much nowadays, as everyone wants to go on holiday to Lanzarote, Zante or 
	Ibiza. James disagreed, saying that the number of emmets in Cornwall meant that they were all invading God's Country!
	<br><br>
	We finished our fish and chips and climbed up the castle motte to the entrance, where we fumbled with our phones to scan the QR codes from our tickets, we passed 
	through the gatehouse and we were in! Yay! We immediately cut across the wet grass (ruining James's canvas shoes) to the first tower on our right (the Henry VII 
	Tower), where we saw a lovely dungeon, before climbing up the spiral staircase to see the rest of the rooms in the tower. It was at this point that we discovered 
	that James is unable to negotiate spiral staircases. He stumbled his way up, falling over at regular intervals, all to the sound of Matthew laughing hysterically.
	<br><br>
	One of the first rooms we encountered was the diorama of Henry VII's birth. Naturally, James had to have a photo in front of it. We ran down the corridor that Matthew 
	remembered from his school trip to the castle over a decade ago (the corridor seemed a lot smaller now) to a room with a large fireplace (James approved) and a view 
	of the local gypsy camp (James also approved), before going down another spiral staircase to the courtyard (cue more stumbling and tripping from James). After a 
	quick look at a garderobe, we climbed up more stairs to the battlements (by the Westgate Tower), where we could see for miles! We had a great view of the moat, a 
	fantastic view of the old houses in the town centre, and a perfect view of the gypsy camp. Noice.
	<br><br>
	We attempted to climb up to the flag pole, but it was closed due to chock. This was one of many such disappointments. Pembroke Castle is normally a warren of 
	interconnecting corridors and staircases, and it is very very easy to get lost (more fun that way, see?). But thanks to chock, social distancing and one-way systems, 
	there would be little chance to lose James in some dungeon somewhere. Damn it!
	<br><br>
	We then followed the battlements around towards the great hall, passing a smithy, a herb garden, a chapel and yet more passageways which were closed off. Sad. 
	Fortunately, many of the rooms in the great hall section of the castle were still open. We saw the Norman Hall and Northern Hall, where James also managed to utter 
	some profanity right before we rounded a corner and came face-to-face with a young family. However, to Matthew's utter despondency, the cavern underneath the castle 
	(the highlight of the entire trip, not least for the enormous spiral staircase that led down there) was closed! What was the point of the trip now?	
</p>
	<center><img src="../resources/photos/Sane.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	This was the point. James decided that the sane course of action here would be to crawl into the fireplace, in front of a large crowd of people, and pretend to 
	be the serving boy. Look at how wonderfully sane he looks!
	<br><br>
	We spent a couple of minutes in the pouring rain, attempting to find any rooms or corridors which hadn't been covid-sealed. James then fucked off for a few minutes 
	somewhere whilst Matthew read a display about William Marshall, 1<sup>st</sup> Earl of Pembroke (which was very, very interesting)... all in a shower of rain.
	<br><br>
	Meanwhile, in a hovel, in Pembroke Castle. James is shivering of cold, his feet rotting away from the trenchfoot that has now taken ahold of him and he is feeling as 
	sane as ever. After deciding to be a serving boy, he say in the hovel as many people went past and were scared of his existence in the only dry alcove of the castle.
	Things were turning dire, he feel had no longer have feeling and his nose was following suit, it was almost time for a drink.
	<br><br>
	We then reunited as the rain dissipated, and climbed up onto the other battlements for some more pictures. We then went to investigate the giant map in the centre of 
	the castle courtyard. Pembroke Castle has a giant map of Wales, with all the major castles/abbeys/other historical sites shown as large, named, coloured icons on the 
	map, and all the other minor castles/abbeys/historical sites accordingly given smaller, unnamed icons. So, here we had a little meta-NT adventure - all the castles! 
	We quickly ticked off all the castles in the dense region of Dyfed, jumped between the multitude of minor locations in Glamorganshire, before heading up north through 
	sheepland to the north of Wales, seeing Conway, Caernarfon and Chester to name a few. We finished off at the northernmost point that James had ever been to! Wow! Not 
	bad for a trip to Carmarthen!
	<br><br>
	We then headed for the penultimate tower (the Barbican/Northgate Towers), where James had a real spastic moment on the stairs, and seemed to forget how to put one 
	foot in front of the other. The photos and videos Matthew took of him dying on the spiral staircase will haunt him forever. Matthew meanwhile posed for his own photo 
	in a fireplace.
	<br><br>
	Finally, we tackled yet more spiral staircases in the Gatehouse. We started off in a room detailing the history of Pembroke Castle, and how it was constructed over 
	time by its various owners, before moving onto a display about the French "invasion" of Pembroke which was terribly planned, carried out by convicts and stopped by a 
	group of local women and infantrymen. These infantrymen became a unit in later years, and the subsequent display was about their own history, as the only unit to 
	have battle honours from a British land battle. We then climbed more stairs to see the civil war exhibition, which included yet more fascinating dioramas of people 
	being murdered (Pembroke Castle was a focal point during the English Civil War), before finishing off in the final diorama of a medieval family eating in the castle 
	dining room - with only knives.
	<br><br>
	We then headed out of the castle, jumped an entire queue of people waiting to leave (breaking social distancing in the process) and walking to the bottom of the 
	motte, back in the town centre. Unfortunately, as enjoyable as the castle visit had been, it had only lasted 90 minutes. Therefore, James came up with a plan!
	<br><br>
	We descended back towards the beer garden by the moat, to see if we could enter the Royal George pub there, as they were participating in the 'Eat out to help out' 
	scheme. Unfortunately, everyone else had had the same idea, and we were told the pub was full. So, it was time for plan B! We crossed the river and walked into the 
	pub on the opposite bank. We entered around the back, sat down and gave our contact details. James was taking Matthew drinking!
	<br><br>
	James, being a seasoned hasher, is now an alcoholic. He not only drinks gin and port like they are water, but he has developed an ability to down pints too. For 
	Matthew though, this was his first time in a pub (excluding Spoons). This was all very new and alien to him, and according to James, he seemed to revert back to 
	Year 10 Matthew - somewhat mouse-like. James ordered a pint of cider for himself and a half-pint for Matthew to try. After a minute or two, our drinks were brought 
	over, and James immediately started gulping his down. Matthew on the other hand...
	<br><br>
	<strong>James</strong>: Matthew, what are you doing? Do you not like the smell?<br>
	<strong>Matthew</strong>: No, I'm just investigating it<br>
	<strong>James</strong>: Matthew, it is okay! I'm not trying to poison you!<br>
	<strong>Matthew</strong>: I like sniffing things, okay?
	<br><br>
	As we were now getting drunk in a pub, we came to the conclusion that we must have already exhausted absolutely everything that there was to do in Pembroke... 2 
	hours ahead of schedule. As there is nothing Matthew likes less than wandering around purposeless, we decided that the best course of action would be to leave shortly 
	and catch the earlier train. Matthew had a few sips of his cider before deciding he didn't like it, James downed his entire pint in one go, James went up to pay, and 
	we left, with about 15 minutes to do what had seemed like a half an hour walk on the way out. Whilst tipsy.
	<br><br>
	So we walked through Pembroke, talking about diverse alcohol-related subjects such as the running trend of James being forced into trying new alcohols in a variety 
	of amusing and strange situations, before deciding he loves it and getting as drunk as a fish; and Matthew's taste buds seemingly being able to detect even trace 
	quantities of alcohol, despite the regular abuse he subjects his tongue to, thanks to his habit of drinking almost-boiling hot tea. Fortunately though, despite 
	James's lack of sobriety, actually knowing where we were going this time meant that we arrived at the station a few minutes ahead of schedule. We walked past our 
	Chinese fwiends and had the obligatory station sign photo, before boarding our train home.
</p>
	<center><img src="../resources/photos/Pembroke.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	Unfortunately, it was only roughly 3 o'clock, and neither of us wanted to return home so quickly. We decided to look up stuff we could do to kill time along the 
	way. James suggested Laugharne, but that was too hard to access. Matthew suggested Pembrey, but the walking time was excessive even for him. We checked Burry Port and 
	Ferryside but found nothing. Then we checked Carmarthen, where we'd have to spend an hour anyway, and discovered a tea shop - Tea Traders. This would be our second 
	port of call on this adventure!
	<br><br>
	The train pulled into Carmarthen, where once again the security guards enforced mask-wearing and social distancing, and we crossed the bridge back into town, a 
	well-trodden route by this point. Matthew remarked that it was sad that the tiny funfair which had popped up by the bridge during Sampi 6 was now absent thanks to 
	chock. We entered the town, got slightly lost on the way to the shop, but eventually found it and stood outside awkwardly, as the shop sign said it was closed 
	already. Just as we were about to turn around, the owner came outside and invited us in, explaining that he had only 'closed' early due to the town centre being 
	abandoned when the rain hit earlier. We stepped inside and were greeted by a sight far better than we had imagined!
	<br><br>
	All along the wall were shelves and shelves of tea! This was an absolutely vast collection of all types, from Black and White teas, to Green and Oolong, all the way 
	to a specialty tea that was grown in the Vale of Glamorgan (Peterston tea estate)! This last tea was descended from the Cornish Tregothnan plantation, and this year 
	was their first crop (which explained why it was rather pricey). The owner introduced himself as Paul, and we introduced ourselves in turn. We started a long chat 
	about what teas we prefer, with Matthew saying that he liked black teas (especially Ceylon) and some Japanese green teas (Sencha), with James saying that he liked 
	<b>no</b> black teas, and only liked Chinese green teas. Paul said that he preferred Oolong. We chose some teas to buy later, and then Paul offered to make us a 
	complimentary cup of tea each, from any tea we wanted (<a href="https://teatraders.co.uk/" target="_blank">Tea Traders</a> doubles as both a tea shop and a teahouse, 
	so usually you can go and have a cup of tea and a scone during the day, if you don't want to buy a full bag of tea).
	<br><br>
	We sat down and continued talking, whilst Paul made us some tea each. Matthew went for some Yunnan Orange Pekoe, which he fully intends to buy next time he takes 
	Freya to the shop in Carmarthen. Matthew would probably say that Yunnan tea is his new favourite, as it has a really good depth of flavour for a black tea, without 
	being overpowering enough to require milk (like Assam). The jury is still out upon whether or not Yunnan would displace his perennial favourite, Ceylon, or whether 
	the recent contender Lapsang Souchong would best them both. Other teas which caught Matthew's eye were the Nilgiri and Nepalese teas. Despite this, Matthew ended up 
	buying a Kagoshima blend of Genmaicha (sencha mixed with toasted rice) from Kyushu, and Fujian Iron Goddess of Mercy Oolong (Tie Kuan Yim) as a birthday present for 
	Freya (which turned out to be her favourite variety of Oolong, after she checked on Reddit).
	<br><br>
	James had a cup of special 'bug bitten' tea, where insects are encouraged to bite the tea leaves before harvest, changing their chemical composition and producing a 
	unique flavour of tea. He enjoyed it very much, and Paul had the second infusion of the tea. James enjoyed his tea so much that he proclaimed that perhaps he liked 
	black tea after all, only to be told that this was in fact oolong tea, a partially-oxidised variety somewhere between green and black tea, with the ability to survive 
	multiple infusions, each yielding a different flavour profile. This then started a long conversation about different teas, Camellia Sinensis (including the Assamica 
	variety), the Opium Wars, and Britain's attempts to grow teas outside China, which were honestly rather funny - we smuggled Camellia Sinensis Sinensis into the Assam 
	region, and tried to grow it ourselves, but failed. We then paid Chinese tea masters to come over to help us grow it, only to be told "Why are you trying to grow this 
	[Sinensis] here? There is a native tea plant [Assamica] which has already been growing here all this time!"
	<br><br>
	After learning that Paul gives tea talks in non-Covid times, we finished our teas, and went to buy some more to take home with us. Matthew bought his Genmaicha and 
	Tie Kuan Yim, whilst James chose Bug Bitten and Mao Jian. We said goodbye and headed out into Carmarthen once more, only to find that we'd missed our train (worth it 
	though) and would have to kill an hour. We wandered around the empty town for a bit, laughing at the graffiti on an accupuncture clinic, before getting insufferably 
	bored and heading down towards the river. It was probably at this point that Matthew developed his hatred of Carmarthen, as he had spent far longer in the small, empty 
	town than he was able to withstand. Fortunately for him, this wouldn't be his final visit this summer!
	<br><br>
	Here, we finally brought out our crisps and started eating them, whilst sitting in the light mizzle, facing the freezing cold torrent of a river beneath us. We 
	chatted for a bit about how different this summer was, and how long ago last summer seemed and read the partial account of Koppa 2 that Matthew had written recently, 
	before Matthew's mum had a fit and called him/texted him n times because he was out 3 nanoseconds past 6 o'clock. James posed for yet another picture, crouching down 
	inside a little plastic boat toy, munching on his crisps, before we started to walk back across the river, to the station, and onto our train home.
