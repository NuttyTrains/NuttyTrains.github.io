	It's Trago time! Join us on a quest through the shittiest bits of Merthyr Tydfil to the holy grail of discount shops - Trago! Featuring Tesco Station, TfW's 
	antisymmetric new HQ and Plan E. 0/10 would not recommend.
	<br><br>
	At last! Mrs Arthur <s>had not</s> removed her ban on James heading east, but we did it anyway, as Matthew was now completely fed up of the countryside - it was time to 
	head back to the valleys, and Matthew had just the valley in mind... Merthyr Tydfil! Indeed, thanks to the timings of non-rush hour trains in and out of Cardiff, 
	Matthew had come up with an excellent plan that involved spending HOURS in the town. But this was great, because Merthyr was clearly shit enough to keep us 
	entertained for many hours, right?
	<br><br>
	James boarded a fairly packed morning train to Cardiff, having just made it on time, no thanks to the rubbish busses. James boarded the train before 9am, and Matthew 
	joined at Neath just afterwards, and we were off, on yet another trip to the valleys! The trip down to Cardiff was very enjoyable - we hadn't done this route in 
	absolutely ages. We arrived in Cardiff and soon after were back on the train, this time uppa Valleys!
	<br><br>
	We passed many of our favourite Sampi locations - Radyr, where a pacer and a sprinter had raced from different platforms, NANTGARW, Pontypridd, where we had waited 
	previously in the pouring rain for a connection (and also where the comically long station looms over the town), and a load of shitty valley towns, which actually 
	looked much less shit, now that the sun was shining and the bunting was out. In fact, the journey up was very pleasant, now that the sides of the valley were bright 
	and illuminated by the sun, not shrouded in mist with darkness approaching and the rain bucketing down.
	<br><br>
	On our way up to Tesco station, a family joined the train. This shouldn't have been a problem. However, they showed blatant disregard for all social distancing rules. 
	The children decided to run up and down the train like headless morons, ripping off the social-distancing tape, and then eating it. The mother didn't care. She had her 
	nose 5 miles into her phone, reading the Daily Star and sniffing crack cocaine off the screen.
	<br><br>
	Eventually, we pulled into our favourite station of all time: Merthyr Tydfil Tesco station. How fucking glorious! Never before, or since, have we come across any 
	station that equals the station straight out of heaven. How we thank the Gods of Arriva for placing this station here. Amen.
	<br><br>
	Just like on Sampi 1, we decided to head into Tesco, except this time, we actually went inside with the intention to buy something. By now, this wasn't even surprising. 
	Of course we were meandering through Merthyr Tydfil Tesco, browsing the medicine aisle. This was a completely normal situation to be in, on a nutty train adventure, in 
	the middle of a pandemic. :)
	<br><br>
	Matthew bought himself some Vaseline, and James bought some Pizza Express-flavoured crisps. How interesting. We paid, and exited Tesco - it was time to enter Merthyr... 
	when we could work out how to navigate the shopping centre behind Tesco. Eventually, we made our way out, and began our trek through the town centre, up towards Trago. 
	We made our way up the high street, passing the smorgasbord of shops that Merthyr Tydfil is famous for having in its vibrant town centre, including Greggs, and many 
	pubs (some of which were still offering Eat Out to Help Out, but we thought we'd be pushing our luck if we went to a pub in Merthyr - we'd quite like to make it home 
	in a non-powdered form). We turned past the <i>enormous</i> bus station, which seemed comically large compared to the train station, and also of a really peculiar 
	(and self-evidently covid-safe) design. It seemed to be a tubular design - various small stations of one or two bays each, connected by long glass and plastic tubes, 
	to form a ring of smaller bus stations. It was very odd. We then ran across the busy road, and made our way up the path by the side of the river, heading for our 
	first destination of the day: <a href="https://upsetvictorians.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-true-origin-of-china-nickname-for.html">Chinatown</a>!
	<br><br>
	It is worth noting at this point that Merthyr's "Chinatown", as it was called at the time, was not really a Chinatown in the traditional sense. More specifically, 
	there were no Chinese buildings, restaurants or people in Chinatown. It was just called Chinatown because they felt like it. Chinatown had been at the very heart of 
	Victorian Merthyr's slums, occupying only a very small area, yet cramming hundreds of people, pubs, brothels and drug dens into an incredibly dense zone. It even had 
	its own "Emperor", complete with a tea warehouse and a religious nutcase preacher! This was everything we ever wanted from NT! Moreover, it appeared to have a 
	Chinese takeaway. This was perfect! Ad Chinatown!
	<br><br>
	Alas, we were left heartbroken. "Chinatown" was now merely a single road of respectable-looking terraced houses, with shiny council offices behind them, and no 
	evidence at all of their glorious history. Even the takeaway appeared to in fact be Indian, or Thai, not Chinese. Not even James's story about being sick in a 
	bush could lift the mood. This was devastating. Unfortunately, there were more disappointments to come later.
	<br><br>
	We made our way through some dodgy council estate (which had very strange-looking houses - one seemed to have a clock tower or something), after crossing the river, 
	and then started climbing quite hard. We walked over to a huge junction, and after getting briefly confused, we embarked upon our quest... along the side of a dual 
	carriageway. This really was true Merthyr style. There was a very narrow pavement that snaked its way alongside the road, but the narrow grassy verge separating us 
	from the loud, busy and fast stream of traffic was not enough to reassure us. Simply put: we were terrified that we could be run over at literally any moment. This 
	was slightly too intense even for NT. To break the mood, we brought out the crisps, which were surprisingly very nice.
	<br><br>
	Eventually we reached the top, and came upon our next major obstacle - a huge roundabout. This was the pinch point of the trip, which Matthew had been unable to 
	solve by looking at a map. It would be pure guesswork as to whether we would actually be able to cross, and how we would then cross the A470 just up ahead. We 
	paced back and forth, investigating the area, looking for any way across the impenetrable obstacle, that neither involved running across the roundabout, sprinting 
	across the near-motorway, or walking along the hard shoulder. Unfortunately, this seemed a rather impossible set of initial conditions. This was devastating, as the 
	towers of Trago were now in sight, and were just on the other side of the A470. We couldn't give up now! After an aborted attempt to cross the roundabouts in one 
	direction, we instead took the footbridge across the road, to travel around the roundabout in the other direction. At last, we had defeated the first obstacle! 
	Following this, we followed a footpath down alongside B&Q, and then underneath the A470, and into a small residential street perched alongside it, thereby giving us 
	a way across the near-motorway without getting blasted into pieces by the oncoming traffic. Huzzah!
	<br><br>
	We walked up past the few houses, which were quite obviously in a very rural area before Trago had arrived (and later became a chock hotspot in March 2021), and 
	continued to climb the barren mountain that overlooked Merthyr and separated it from Aberdare. The mountains in the valleys are very odd near the heads of the valleys. 
	They lose most vegetation and become barren moorland and scrubland, with the only signs of life being some hardy yellow grasses, some heather and some bracken. It is 
	almost like stepping straight into the Scottish Highlands. 
	<br><br>
	We eventually got to the looming razor wire gates, guarding the entrance road to Trago, crossed over, and entered the threshold - here we were - we had done it! We walked 
	along the road for a little while, then ran down a steep dusty path down to the service car park, and slowly rounded the exterior of the massive building.
	<br><br>
	Yet despite being near his favourite shop in the world, things were already starting to seem off to James. A sprawling car park? A collection of disjointed outbuildings 
	and warehouses? A soft play centre? Restaurants on the outside? No real windows in the towers? Worst of all, no cafe at the top of the watchtower? This was beginning 
	to appear suspiciously like a <i>*spits*</i> DEVON Trago!
	<br><br>
	James was temporarily calmed by the reappearance of a familiar face - one of the shops lining the entrance to Trago was a Warrens Bakery, and they do the best Cornish 
	pasties of them all! We each had a Cornish Pasty for lunch. This was Matthew's first proper Cornish pasty, and he will admit that it was in fact very noice. After 
	fending off a lone seagull (this truly was like Kernow), we headed inside... 
	<br><br>
	<strong>THIS ISN'T PROPER TRAGO!</strong>
	<br><br>
	James was right. This wasn't proper Trago. This was heresy. Normal Trago, in God's Country, is actually made up of a sequence of individual rooms, each housing a 
	different department selling unique things. You must pass through the rooms in a certain order, as they all lead into one another, despite there being no logic to 
	the order in which the rooms appear - for example, the restaurant is just in one of the rooms at random, and you have to pass through it to continue shopping. 
	But this had none of that. It was just an enormous warehouse, selling discounted crap, with no rooms to speak of! It was just like any other bargain basement ever! 
	No departments, no rooms, and no restaurant inside - that was outside, in a separate section. How could they have defiled his Trago like this? NOOOOOOOO!
	<br><br>
	We did have a wander through the fake Trago though. We started in the garden section, then moved onto more DIY stuff. We then entered into some upholstery and furniture, 
	where we saw this amazing, amazing bed unit:
</p>

<center><img src="../resources/photos/Corona.jpg" width="55%"></center>

<p>
	But not even Chock could improve this. Nor could the collection of random books (including one by Colin Beveridge), the completely outdated tech section, or even 
	the random sofas sitting in the middle of the one-way system. The carpet section was abominable, so bad that at this point, James even admitted that Merthyr 
	Trago was worse than Trago in devil country! The straw that broke the camel's back was the fact that they had replaced the Kernow trinket collection with Welsh 
	souvenirs. This was simply too much to handle. We had to get out of here! We queued for what seemed like eternity, paid, and got out of there as quickly as possible. 
	<br><br>
	This, however, caused a problem. We had bargained that Trago would be so amazing that we would spend hours there. Instead, it had been so disappointing, that despite 
	our best efforts to go as slowly as possible, we had barely wasted an hour. Moreover, there was fuck all else to do in Merthyr. We were fed up of the town that had 
	proven to be such a disappointment, and decided that we wanted to leave as soon as possible.
	<br><br>
	So we did. We climbed back up to the gates, descended the mountain once more, crossed through the tunnel, and re-emerged at the roundabout. We considered visiting 
	M&S to wash the scent of fake Trago off ourselves, but instead crossed the footbridge and headed back down the dual carriageway, back through the council estate, back 
	past Chinatown, along the river, and past the bus station. Before we knew it, we were back in Merthyr town centre, and in strong need of tea. So that is what we did. 
	We headed into the very 60s brutalist shopping centre, located Costa, pretended to fill in the track-and-trace form, ordered our large teas, and sat down to enjoy 
	them. It is really saying something when the most enjoyable part of what should have been a fantastically nuts adventure in the crowning glory of shit valley towns turns 
	out to be a cup of tea in Costa.
	<br><br>
	Halfway through drinking, we left Costa to make our way to the station, as a conveniently-timed train was about to arrive. Matthew downed his remaining tea whilst 
	standing on the platform, and James finished his after the train had started moving. Good riddance to Merthyr Tydfil!
	<br><br>
	We were rather fed up and disappointed by now. Merthyr had meant to signal a return to the halycon glory days of nuttiness - the Sampi adventures. Yet instead, it 
	had been a complete and utter wet fish. We decided to turn to Twitter for solace. We were fresh out of Twitter jail, so what better way to celebrate this precarious 
	situation by firing off a load of controversial tweets?

<p>
	It was still only the early afternoon, and we were in need of something else to occupy our time. As the train rounded its way along the side of Pontypridd, Matthew 
	saw something intriguing. For a brief second, he had caught a glimpse of a large and imposing building, bearing "WALES" in large letters along the side. Could it be 
	the fabled brand-new TfW headquarters? Matthew was certain that it must be! So when the train pulled into the station, Matthew pulled James off, and decided to 
	investigate!
	<br><br>
	Eventually we managed to work out how to exit the strange one-way system of the station, which had confused us before, and was already weird enough before Covid. We 
	did however work out how to make our way to ground level, and stood at the side of the main road, eager to embark upon our quest of discovery! We made our way along 
	the main road, towards the river, and crossed over into the town centre, hoping to catch a better glimpse of the building to confirm or deny Matthew's theory... 
	or indeed just help us know where we were going, as Matthew was just striding off in what he thought was the correct general direction, with absolutely no knowledge 
	of the town centre, and no clear idea as to where he was even headed. We continued along the main road, past rows of familiar terraced Valley houses, all whilst 
	James attempted to glean some idea of what on earth was going through Matthew's mind.
	<br><br>
	James: So where exactly are you dragging me?<br>
	Matthew: To the TfW HQ! I caught a brief glimpse of it in this direction from the train! Come on!<br>
	James: Are you sure?<br>
	Matthew: Yes! I saw a big building with "Wales" written on the side! It has to be it!<br>
	James: Matthew! This is Wales! Lots of buildings have "Wales" written on the side! How can you be sure it was the TfW HQ? You can't just assume every building with 
	"Wales" on the side is the TfW HQ!<br>
	Matthew: Yes I can! Clearly every building with "Wales" on in fact has "Transport for..." before it. "Wales" implies "Transport for". <br>
	James: No Matthew! I'll grant you, that round here, "Transport for" implies "Wales", but not the other way around! What has Kevin been teaching you?<br>
	Matthew: I am standing my ground! That is the TfW HQ! "Transport for" implies "Wales", and "Wales" implies "Transport for"! They are one and the same! x implies y, 
	y implies x!<br>
	*rounds corner, at which point the TfW HQ finally comes into view* <br>
	Matthew: See, I told you, it is <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antisymmetric">antisymmetric</a> - x=y!
	<br><br>
	Sure enough, it was the TfW HQ, and we made our way down to the construction site. This truly was a monument to a fantastic train operator - a veritable Mecca for 
	those who are interested in trains! Knowing that a photo here would become a valuable possession once this HQ was rightfully acknowledged as an icon of train history, 
	we had a picture, before we'd have to compete with the hoards of tourists that are one day bound to visit this beautiful landmark:
</p>

	<center><img src="../resources/photos/TfW.jpg" width="55%"></center>

<p>
	Jokes aside, it was a very nice building. Matthew had once been paid to write an article about the constuction of this and the neighbouring offices, as well as the 
	new library down the street. All three were easily the nicest things in the town. We crossed the bridge to the park on the opposite bank of the river, crossed back, 
	attempted to steal a chair from the middle of the street (only to find it was firmly anchored down), and decided to make our way back to the station.
	<br><br>
	We walked this time through the town centre, passing many charity shops and poundshops. We then went off the beaten track, and found a dodgy-looking entrance to 
	Pontypridd Market, which turned out to be surprisingly nice. There was even a nice-looking Chinese restaurant, which James entered, in order to speak to the owner 
	and practice his Chinese.
	<br><br>
	We eventually emerged back at the main street, crossed over to the station, and made our way up onto the extremely long platform, which we decided to walk all the 
	way to the end of, in order to kill time. For some strange reason, Pontypridd has the longest station platforms in Wales, which gives the actually rather busy station 
	a permanent feeling of disuse and neglect. We reached the end of the platform, turned around... and saw our train approaching the other end. Fuck. We abandoned all 
	thoughts of being Covid-safe and legged it to the other end. This is pretty much a <i>running</i> theme by now. Fortunately, all this practice meant that we beat the 
	train to the platform, and had just enough time to snap this (very hasty) picture before boarding:
</p>

	<center><img src="../resources/photos/Pontypridd.jpg" width="55%"></center>

<p>
	Seeing that Chinese restaurant in Pontypridd market had made James crave Chinese food, so we spent much of the journey past Nantgarw searching for a suitable 
	restaurant in Cardiff. Before long, James had found an excellent-looking one in Llandaf, and decided to see if they were open.
	<br><br>
	When we reached Radyr, James was deeply disappointed that in what may be his final TfW adventure before the end of 2020 (the then-deadline for removing all 
	remaining pacers), he had not yet been on a pacer. So when we pulled into the station and found a pacer waiting on the other platform, we jumped at the chance! 
	We disembarked, crossed over the bridge and boarded the pacer on the other platform. Ah, pacers. How we will miss the jolting, screaming rides that we have 
	all grown to love. On the way back to Cardiff Central, we passed the Canton sheds, and admired the motley collection of trains, of all different types, of 
	all different liveries, and of all different states of decay, that TfW had stolen from operators from around the country. It was a trainspotter's paradise - 
	all the UK's trains were gathered in one place. Trainspotters! Come to Cardiff! There is plenty to see, except for us, as we will be elsewhere!
	<br><br>
	We pulled into Cardiff Central, bid our pacer adieu, and walked into the city centre, looking for a Chinese takeaway. We walked around the city centre in a 
	number of loops, before settling on a certain takeaway, and making our way towards Queen Street. It looked promising to James on the outside, having no 
	English text whatsoever, but it turned out that it was in fact closed. Time for Plan B.
	<br><br>
	We started to walk up in the direction of Llandaf/Cathays, as the restaurant James had looked up earlier was in fact having renovation work done, and were closed. 
	So instead he rang up another Chinese takeaway, who this time were actually open. He booked a table on the phone, and we started walking to the restaurant. We eventually 
	arrived at the restaurant. The front of the restaurant had fallen onto the pavement, in pieces. It was a shithole. It looked like you'd get much worse than food 
	poisoning here. So we abandoned this plan. Time for Plan C.
	<br><br>
	Not really knowing what else to do, we continued walking towards Cathays, hoping that the number of uni students there would guarantee a Chinese takeaway. We crossed 
	the road encircling the city centre, and walked past the National Museum, and past Cathays train station. We crossed the shitty, slippery cast iron bridge at the 
	station, and then continued up, past the Maths department, to a crossroads, where we turned right into a studenty area, filled with Asian food shops and takeaways.
	<br><br>
	We passed a nice looking Chinese takeaway along the way, and decided that this would be our Plan C. As it was not yet open, we continued up to another crossroads, 
	and there found a Domino's Pizza, which seemed like a suitable backup Plan D. However, both of us preferred the idea of Chinese, so we abandoned Plan D and returned 
	to Plan C.
	<br><br>
	We stood outside the takeaway for about 20 minutes, admiring the collection of books in the ex-phonebox, now mini-library, watching the students walk by, and 
	reading the menu. We were now very hungry. After opening time had been and gone, the owner's son walked out, and said that they were in fact closed. Damn! We'd 
	have to find a Plan E, and we were starving!
	<br><br>
	Fortunately, Plan E was not far away. There was a Japanese restaurant on the opposite side of the street, Yukiyan. Even though James wanted Chinese, this was 
	good enough for him, as he was starving. We went inside, and sat down. It was very nice in there - very calm and relaxing. We both ordered green tea, some 
	sushi starters, and a noodle main, all of which were delicious (much better than the Wagamama we had visited on Koppa 2). This definitely had been worth all the 
	setbacks. When we were done, we paid, and James crossed the street to a Chinese bakery, where he had a long conversation with the owners, and came out with a 
	taro dessert. Not bad for Plan E.
	<br><br>
	We made our way back to the city centre, and entered the St Davids shopping centre, whilst killing a few minutes waiting for our train home. It was here that 
	Matthew introduced James to Borat, and his anti-Jew songs, which James found hilarious. VEY NICE! James would later spend that evening watching Borat, and learning 
	all the words to "Throw the Jew down the well!". 
</p>

	<center><iframe frameborder="0" height="360px" width="640px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4hlwDSnkXrA" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>

<p>
	We boarded our train home (a Class 800), and would usually settle in for a rest on the way home. But instead, James showed Matthew the joys of Penryn Fitfinder, 
	the Facebook page where Penryn art students quite literally search for fresh meat to have one-night stands with. This was clearly intolerable to both of us, so 
	we decided that it was time to break out BooleanBot, and fact-check all these horrific posts. The logic behind BooleanBot is simple - BooleanBot answers "True" 
	if the post is true, according to the principles of logic, and "False" if otherwise. Needless to say, BooleanBot has made the already-popular James even more 
	popular on Penryn Fitfinder.
	<br><br>
	Eventually, Matthew disembarked at Neath to head home, whilst James continued to Swansea, boarded a bus that travelled through Mayhill, and finally arrived 
	home to spend his evening watching Borat. Great Success!
