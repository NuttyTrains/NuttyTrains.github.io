	The train at platform Dai is the 1023 serive to god knows where. It has been sitting here for god knows how long and it is god knows how late, calling at 
	Llanshitole, Castellcrap and Timbuk-fucking-to. Please social distance and stay the fuck away from each other. Karen! MASK! ON!
	<br><br>
	Well, it was too good to be true. Whilst Matthew may have arrived at the station with so much time to spare on the previous adventure, this time he screamed out of 
	bed, absolutely exhausted, and sprinted to the station like his life depended on it. He ran almost the entire distance to the train and could barely breathe through 
	his mask by the time he arrived. He was only just through the ticket barrier when the train to Swansea rocked up, and had to sprint up the stairs, along the 
	bridge, down the stairs and through the closing train door to make it on time.
	<br><br>
	This had all been because Matthew's usual train, the 8:46, was suddenly missing from the timetable, forcing him to catch the 8:37... except he left as if he was 
	about to catch the 8:46. Regardless, by the time he reached Swansea, he was exhausted, so decided to go to McDonalds for some cheap coffee to tide him over. 
	He wandered out of the station, down High Street, and through Castle Square to McDonalds, whereupon he ordered himself a coffee. And waited. And waited. And 
	waited. They were really taking their time. And waited. If they didn't hurry up soon, then catching the train would be hard. And waited. What were they doing 
	back there? And waited. Were they growing the beans themselves? And waited. And waited. And waited. HURRY UP AND MAKE THE DAMN COFFEE!
	<br><br>
	Eventually Matthew got his coffee, but only had 4 minutes to make it to the station (you know the drill by now). So he ran. And ran. And ran. He ran through the 
	pouring rain, hood swept back by the wind, side-stepping puddles and dashing across any road in his way. He could barely see thanks to the torrential rain, and 
	the sloshing of the coffee in the cup meant that plenty of coffee was escaping the cup and instead burning his hand. As he ran up High Street, completely out of 
	breath, he fumbled in one hand with his mask, and the other with the burning cup of coffee as he approached the station. Matthew made it inside, juggled the cup 
	about whilst trying to find the right ticket, made it through the barrier and just about made it onto the train in time, with a hand in pain, and as drenched as 
	a rat. Kind of normal at this point.
	<br><br>
	Nevertheless, Matthew sat down on the train to tell James that the train was leaving Swansea, only to find that James was in fact on the wrong bus entirely. Ha. 
	Ha. Ha. Very funny. All that running for nowt. When the train reached Gowerton, Matthew was standing by the door, fully expecting James not to have arrived, but 
	thanks to a stroke of luck, James was in fact there despite his negative 1-minute connection, and NT could continue!
	<br><br>
	This was yet another journey to Carmarthen. Again. Thanks to TfW changing their timetables, such that few to no services travel past Carmarthen, yet another 
	adventure was to be punctuated by another spell in Carmarthen. For the third time in a row. This was so ridiculous at this point that we calculated at we would 
	have spent more time in Carmarthen at the end of R<sub>0</sub>=5 than any other single destination over the course of the R<sub>0</sub> adventures so far. 
	Matthew made sure that his grievances against the town were well-known, and vowed not to head west on an adventure again, until he would no longer have to 
	wait at Carmarthen.
	<br><br>
	Carmarthen station was now extremely familiar to us by this point, as was the bridge to the town centre, and the town centre itself. So we decided to mix things 
	up this morning, and instead headed to Lidl to buy some healthy fruit, because these adventures are healthy and not at all dangerous or unsafe. We crossed the 
	bridge, walked along the pavement for a few dozen yards, crossed the road, and walked up the road to Lidl, where we bought some fruit (nectarines) for later. 
	<br><br>
	We then wandered through some back alleyways into the very familiar town centre, aimlessly walked around for a little bit and then made our way slowly back down 
	to the station yet again, to wait for our train to turn up. We took pictures of the ATW train with a rainbow decal, and crossed back and forth between the 
	platforms, unsure as to where our train would turn up and depart from. We must have looked so suspicious to the army of police officers standing around the 
	station!

	Platform Dai! Go Go Go!

<p>
	We made it onto our train on Platform Dai with plenty of time to spare for once, which was a TfW sprinter (partially, but not completely refurbished, and 
	refurbished in a questionable manner to say the least) with half the doors taped off. We took our seats and settled in for the very short journey to Tenby.
	<br><br>
	As we approached the seaside town, the weather took a turn for the worse. Hmm. This wasn't looking good. We disembarked at the station and waved our train 
	off, as it followed our route from 2 adventures ago, towards Pembroke. The rain was coming down fairly hard already, as we walked out of the station and up 
	the street towards Premier Inn and the seaside - ah, it was good to be by the sea!
	<br><br>
	We walked all the way along the length of the seafront, battling the strong winds, horizontal rain and James's newfound nemesis: slippery slopes. We passed 
	the bench where we had spent the majority of Beta 2, and rounded our way across to the headland, passing all the pastel-coloured houses on the way. We 
	climbed up the headland, weaving our way in and out of the various defensive fortifications of Tenby Castle (of which a much greater percentage was open 
	than had been in Pembroke Castle), before climbing to the very top and standing at the top of the outcrop, admiring the mizzle (and resulting lack of 
	people). We walked around the defensive tower, coastguard house, the statue and the multitude of cannons, all in the pouring rain. We then descended to a 
	lower path encircling the hill, saw the bandstand, and then descended the stairs down to the beach.
	<br><br>
	Matthew doesn't like the beach. The sand is coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.
	<br><br>
	James, on the other hand, could finally channel his inner Cornishman - he lived for the sea! He loves the sand, he loves surfing on the sea, he loves being 
	unable to swim, and all his school trips had been to the seaside, to admire rockpools. Which is exactly what we did. We wandered over to some rocky outcrops, 
	near the rocky island at the edge of the beach, and essentially queued behind another family, waiting to walk through the tunnel, carved by the sea, through 
	the underside of the island. We managed to get quite high up the rocks whilst waiting. Eventually though, it was our turn to hop across the rocks punctuating 
	the water-filled tunnel, and make it through to the other side of the beach.
	<br><br>
	On the other side, we saw some seagulls tearing about chunks of crab, and many pieces of crab littering the sand. Lovely stuff. We also saw a multitude of 
	smaller caves pock-marking the cliff face of the rocky island, which we duly went to explore:

<p>
	Once Caliban had finished in the early caves, we went to explore a much deeper one, with access to the sea on the other side. This one had dozens of pools 
	of water at the bottom, and we made our way to the back of the cave with varying degrees of success, and with only a few failures that resulted in getting 
	very wet. This cave too had been attacked by seagulls, and there were many chunks of crab here as well. Luckily though, we eventually found 1 small alive 
	crab, whom we decided to christen "Dave".
</p>

<p>
	We then left the large cave, and slowly made our way down the beach, back towards the town. Along the way, however, we came across even more interesting 
	rocky outcrops, some of which concealed caves, not unlike Caliban's first caves, or indeed James's fireplace in Pembroke Castle:

<p>
	Do I really need to comment here?
	<br><br>
	We finally left the rocky island, and, jumping across the sandy rivulets, we made our way back to the town. Matthew grudgingly admitted that the beach wasn't 
	<i>too</i> bad. We eventually made our way to a staircase hewn into the rock face itself, and made our way back up to the pastel-coloured houses that lined the 
	seafront, but not before we had taken the time to film this beauty:

<p>
	We then spent the next while wandering around the town centre, with the eventual goal of finding lunch. Oh, and also avoiding as many crowds as possible. The 
	weather was not as shit as it had been when we arrived, and so the crowds of people were beginning to assault the town. Hence, we spent a decent while trying 
	to walk down plenty of backstreets, to try and avoid as many people as possible. It was also at this point that James revealed that he had met his future 
	Mandarin teacher at Exeter, and had opened his interview by criticising her for asking "Ni hao ma", as real Chinese people never, ever ask this!
	<br><br>
	We now started to look up places to eat, and walked over to quite a number of them, but found none of them suitable. Some of them were in fact far more classy 
	and expensive than they had looked on line, some were full, some were closed and some were just too damn chocked. Eventually, we ended up just outside the town 
	wall, trying to get signal to look for a place to eat (which was surprisingly hard to get), and eventually settled on the fantastically-named "Oh My Cod" 
	fish and chips. We walked over there, ordered, recieved our orders and walked down to the beach once more. We turned left at the beach, to head up towards a bit 
	of the North Beach that neither of us had been to before, found a staircase leading down to some benches, passed what smelled like Tenby's crack central, and 
	found a dry-ish bench about halfway down the slope to the beach. Matthew opened up his box of fish and chips, only to watch the fork fly out of the box, into 
	the air, and onto the floor... fingers it was then!
	<br><br>
	We sat eating our fish and chips as the rain picked up once more. Eating fish and chips with one's fingers was turning out to be rather difficult, unfortunately 
	for Matthew. It was made no easier by a group of seagulls flying above us, encircling us.

<p>
	We had a long and <s>amusing</s> painful conversation about the wonders of Caerau - how the residents live at the top of a mountain, surrounded by barbed wire - not to keep 
	others out, but to keep the 'citizens' of Cearau in. Caerau has no police force, as one of the 'citizens' favourite pasttimes is to steal all the tyres off the police car 
	then set it alight, when the police car stops at a red light. This was just home for James! We eventually finished up our fish and chips, climbed back up to the seafront 
	path, and headed back into the town, hoping for a spot of tea, and hoping that some of the crowds had disappated.
	<br><br>
	The crowds seemed to have mostly lightened, but unfortunately, they had all made their way into the various cafes and shops in the town... including our favourite 
	tea shop, which we had visited during Beta 2. Hmm, this would require a new plan. We instead decided to make our way onto the other part of the seafront, by Castle 
	Beach and Tenby's South Beach. Once there, we just kept walking. And walking. And walked until we found somewhere more interesting, where we could kill time. At the 
	time, this walk seemed like ages, and it seemed as if we had completely left the town behind, almost as if we were halfway to Penally (the next village along the 
	coast, and the next train station). However, now that we are writing this up, it turns out that we were but a few yards out of town, at the entrance to Tenby's 
	South Beach. Nevertheless, that degree of walking had tired James out, and he fancied something additional to eat. We went to the South Beach Bar and Grill, took 
	note of the Covid protocols, and headed in for some tea and something to eat.
	<br><br>
	We were shown to our table by a very friendly waitress and sat down. We each ordered a pot of tea, and James was recommended the Brains beer brownies by the waitress. 
	Never one to pass up any alcohol, James immediately decided that this was what he wanted, and ordered one.
	<br><br>
	Shortly after, our tea arrived, and it was very nice and refreshing to have some. We ought to have tea more often on our adventures, especially given the quantity 
	that we both usually drink. Fortunately for James though, he'd very soon get the chance to have something to "drink", as his beer brownie had arrived. And it was 
	<i>enormous!</i>. It was more the size of a large pizza than the kind of brownie he had been expecting, and boy must it have contained plenty of beer! He enjoyed it 
	greatly, but was convinced by the end that his eyes were bigger than his stomach. We paid, and set off, back to the train, having now abandoned our initial plan 
	to walk to Penally station - our train was almost here!
	<br><br>
	We walked briskly back through various residential streets at the back of Tenby, none of which we had ever seen before, in a hope to beat the train to the station. 
	(No matter how late Matthew actually is, he is always terrified of missing connections... possibly because he is usually always late, and misses most of his 
	connections). Meanwhile, navigating the maze of streets was beginning to be a bit much for James. The beer brownie was beginning to kick in. <strong>"I think those 
	beer brownies were slightly ethanolic!"</strong>. 
	<br><br>
	Eventually though, we made our way back to the station, had our photo, and awaited our train. To our enormous surprise, the train that had come to see us was Jezza 
	yet again! Jezza seemed to want to be on <i>every</i> NT adventure! What a glorious <s>stolen</s> train!
</p>

<p>
	The journey home was mostly uneventful, with the exception of the stopover at Carmarthen making Matthew very irritated indeed that he had to visit that cursed 
	town again. We considered paying a visit to the Tea shop once more, but we didn't want to have a flying visit for 5 minutes, as we didn't have long, and wouldn't 
	be able to actually buy anything. There was the minor amusement of an altercation at the station, where two fare-dodging youths were removed from the train at the 
	last minute, and given a stern talking-to by the covid officers. Whilst this was going on, the train departed, leaving the youths behind, as we made our way back home.
