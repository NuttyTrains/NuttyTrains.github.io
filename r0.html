<p>       IT'S CHOCKY TIME!!!  </p>
<p> Thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, we were unable to go on any adventures following Koppa 2 in Jan/Feb 2020 (the first case in the UK was recorded during that 
adventure). However, by the end of July, James was brave enough to attempt using public transport, and quickly dragged Matthew along. Here is a once-in-a-lifetime 
snapshot of our nuts experiences of public transport during a socially distanced world! Illi Vitae! </p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">R<sub>0</sub>=1: "In Cornwall, a large tub is 3 scoops!"</button>
<div class="content">
<p>
	Back to basics in the lockdown - wandering through Neath for miles in the rain, and eating too much ice cream
	<br><br>
	It was a fairly surreal morning when Matthew walked down to Neath train station. Wearing his original mask (which was bright orange, had vents and was too tight on 
	his nose), he was finally going to meet James again, for the 1st time since Koppa 2 in Jan/Feb! Moreover, James had been down in Cornwall until earlier that week, 
	so getting to see him, let alone going on an adventure, was a huge surprise in the so far almost completely uneventful pandemic. However, 4 months in, things were 
	slowly easing open, and the resumption of NT was a huge step towards normality for James and Matthew.
	<br><br>
	James had fled Cornwall with his family, fearing an explosion of emmets invading the county (true to his word, the plague of locusts descended only 1-2 weeks later). 
	Unlike Matthew, James had already been on a train and survived, so James was perfectly happy to take a bus and a train to Neath, where he met Matthew whilst exiting 
	the station. And it was in this manner that the nuttiness was resumed...
	<br><br>
	We wandered around Neath, with our masks on (although James criticised Matthew's mask with vents) before quickly abandoning the charade and heading to Morrisons to 
	buy some lunch and some crisps each. Matthew bought his classic miserly bread rolls, and we also bought the ubiquitous salt and vinegar crisps. We then set off; 
	intrepid explorers in the glorious urban jungle of Neath! 
	<br><br>
	Our first plan of attack was to head towards Skewen, so we crossed the canal, the river, the other canal and the train tracks (admiring the old Neath Low Level/Neath 
	Riverside station which is visible from the bridge) before setting off past the Roman ruins, Dwr-y-Felin and Tesco. We continued up the main road past Neath Abbey 
	and began climbing for approximately a mile, all the way up through Skewen, to <a href="http://www.crescicafe.co.uk/">Cresci's</a> ice cream, where we went in and 
	ordered. 
	<br><br>
	Matthew ordered a large cone with a flake, and stood aside to let James order:<br>
	James: Can I have a large tub please?<br>
	James paid his £5 (which seemed like a sensible price to the Cornishman) and lady serving us then pulled out a massive tub. 'Don't worry,' thought James, 'she'll 
	only put a few scoops in there'. But she didn't. She kept adding more, and more, and more, until the entire 1 litre tub was filled to the brim with ice cream. 
	James looked utterly gobsmacked as he took the gargantuan pot and walked out, to the sound of Matthew laughing at him.
	<br><br>
	Matthew: Why did you order the large tub, James?<br>
	James: I didn't think it would be <i>this</i> big! <strong>In Cornwall, a large tub is 3 scoops!</strong>
	<br><br>
	We walked down the street to Skewen Park, and found a dry bench, as far from the screaming children in the playground as possible, with James resisting the urge to 
	pull out his shotgun, and then ate their ice cream. Or in James's case, attempted to eat his ice cream. It almost proved too much for him, and he gave up at one 
	point, but he came back strong and was able to finish it. He had narrowly avoided Matthew bullying him for having eyes bigger than his stomach for the rest of the 
	adventure. We walked back up through the park, James put his empty family-sized tub into the <s>rusting oil-drum/carcinogen container</s> bin, and we walked back 
	towards Cresci's.
	<br><br>
	Just behind Cresci's is Skewen station, which thanks to the pandemic, was receiving almost no stopping services. However, seeing as we had arrived without using 
	any public transport... Tick! Another ¬station for our ¬station list! We wandered up and down the 2 platforms, admiring the 2 dot matrices (barely working) as 
	they claimed that the station had no services until 10pm. Great work TfW! This disagreed with RTT, which claimed there would be a service in just over an hour, but 
	this was too long to spend in Skewen, and Matthew wasn't quite ready to put the Trains back into Nutty Trains yet. So we kept walking.
	<br><br>
	After another section of walking, we arrived at Neath Abbey, which possibly due to the fact that Cadw seem not to care about it, was open, despite the looming 
	Covid pandemic. We headed inside, passing the building contractors <s>¬</s>working. Neath Abbey was actually quite nice that day, and it was a nice treat for 
	Matthew to visit for the first time in about a decade. We wandered through the ruined rooms, almost got stuck in a garderobe, and then headed out to the destroyed 
	cloisters. James shouted some loud profanity just as we passed some small children. How lovely.
	<br><br>
	We spent much of our remaining time trying to fathom whether the massive chunks of fallen rock had fallen naturally or had been pulled down by the denizens of Neath. 
	This was Neath, so the answer was obviously the latter. We also pressed the Welsh language button on all the available information points, and explored the final 
	few rooms. In there, we found huge lumps of slag, functioning as a chessboard. Neath is brilliant and full of culture! We returned to Neath by walking up the Tennant 
	Canal, past the scaffolding on the Abbey, past the floodplain and the dual carriageway, under the flyover bridge and alongside the river, before arriving in Neath, 
	having admired the shitty, polluted, stagnant water in the canal all the way. Mmmm, tasty. 
	<br><br>
	After a quick second trip to Morrisons to get Matthew some water, we sat in the newly-reopened Victoria Gardens, in the shade, and ate our lunch, despite James 
	having eaten 1 litre of ice cream a mere hour ago. We then deliberated our next course of action, before setting off towards the other canal. We passed the site of 
	the old Neath Canalside station (although Matthew did not know this at the time), and walked the 2.5 mile length of the canal, along the cycle trail from Neath 
	to Briton Ferry. By this point, James's legs were killing him, but Matthew cracked the whip and we pressed on. We passed the back of the Milland Road Industrial 
	Estate and the disused Metal Box Factory, as well as seeing various dilapadated factories and outlet pipes pouring into the river. Such glorious sights had never 
	been seen before. Truly, this was a magnificent trip. We also saw some horses, a few cows and a heron, but Londoners like Matthew care very little for wildlife, 
	so he ignored all that nonsense.
	<br><br>
	Along the way, James revealed that his course was being discontinued, to his great disappointment. Now he would have no freshers to torment! He also revealed that as 
	hardly any of his coursemates actually had A Levels, and as even fewer were actual mathematicians, he was now de facto head of MathSoc and was now responsible for 
	producing some award videos for the MathSoc awards the following week (stay tuned for R<sub>0</sub>=2 everyone!). Matthew meanwhile complained about his estrangement 
	from the beautiful, wonderful MLC :(.
	<br><br>
	With about a mile to go, where the canal and river almost converge, it began to rain somewhat. We picked up the pace as we approached the town. Fortunately, James 
	knew where he was after Matthew explained using some dirty applied mathematics (the only mathematics James knew at this point): 'Neath basically bifurcates into Briton 
	Ferry and Skewen'. We reached the end of the canal section and began to climb steeply. Despite James wheezing at the top, we made it... and went all the way back down 
	to the railway station. ¬Station 2... Tick!
	<br><br>
	There were a similar lack of stopping services in our direction (an 800 came our way and almost blew us off the platform though), but the other platform had an 
	unscheduled 175 stop to pick up the 1 passenger waiting in the shelter. By this point it was raining hard, so we waited in the freezing cold shelter, filled with 
	the relaxing aromas of second-hand smoke, weed and crack. Mmm, welcome to Briton Ferry.
	<br><br>
	James spent most of this wait wondering what these glass objects on his face were used for when it was raining - they had fogged up, and now he was unable to see. 
	We sat talking in the shelter for about half an hour, when we decided that enough was enough and that we had to return to Neath, no matter whether it was raining or 
	not. James pleaded with Matthew to take a bus, but Matthew was adamant - no buses! Therefore, poor James had to stagger the 3 miles home, as Matthew led the way 
	past the glorious sights of Briton Ferry and the Melin (the latter to James's horror - his mum had warned him about the Melin!).
	<br><br>
	We headed to the Gnoll's 1st pond for a sit down, to rest James's exhausted legs, and have some crisps, as tradition dictates. We avoided the groups of chavvy youths 
	as they passed us, and had a nice rest before walking back to the station at some speed, so that James could catch his train and not be forced to spend yet another 
	hour walking around Neath, grinding his legs to stumps. We made it back just in time, so that James could pass through the ticket barrier and make it back before 
	his mum had a fit about the chock. Matthew meanwhile, was reassured by James's account of the train that he could safely take the train next time. Nutty Trains would 
	be back!

<button type="button" class="collapsible">R<sub>0</sub>=2: "That's awful! Awful is my word for amazing!"</button>
<div class="content">
<p>
	Get ready for a mask-wearing, socially-distanced foray to Cardiff, with video filming in IKEA thrown in! (Essential workers only, this is a pandemic, of course)
	<br><br>
	This time Matthew was ready to step on a train for the first time since late March, and so it was time for Nutty <i>Trains</i> to hit the rails once more! James 
	boarded the train in Swansea just before 10 o'clock, and then Matthew joined him at Neath at 10:06, armed with his double mask and complete lack of sanity. The train 
	was only a sprinter, but the carriage was fairly empty nonetheless. This particular class of sprinter is armed with a very large array of Kafkaesque announcements, 
	designed to instill the fear of God into the unsuspecting passenger. These included Welsh Government announcements, warnings about protecting the vulnerable from 
	Covid, congratulatory praise for NHS and essential workers, and frequent reminders that the trains were for essential workers only - NO NON-ESSENTIAL TRAVEL. Oops.
	<br><br>
	We decided to keep fairly quiet as the train made its way down through Port Talbot and Bridgend, as we took in the familiar sights on the route to Cardiff. To 
	Matthew, NT really feels like it comes alive when we head east, as that is the way the valleys lie, and countless nutty trips have been made there in summers and 
	other holidays in the past. As the draconian threats of death to all non-essential travellers continued unabated, we entered the city and pulled into the station - 
	we had arrived at last!
	<br><br>
	We disembarked from the train and were shoved around the socially-distanced station's new one-way system, until we finally found a staircase to take us into the 
	station's underground concourse and out through the ticket barriers into the city centre. James was distraught that the station's M&S was shut, but we carried on, 
	past the new BBC HQ and a person whom James absolutely didn't act REDACTED towards, walked through the middle of a busy road, and joined Cardiff's shopping centre. 
	We passed through one of the arcades which Matthew picked at random, but by sheer luck it happened to be the right choice, as the first stop of the day was located in 
	that very arcade - <a href="https://www.penandpaper.co.uk/">Pen & Paper</a>.
	<br><br>
	We entered the little shop, and started to wander around, albeit getting thoroughly confused by the one-way system that was in place (we were only reassured when one 
	of the employees, with a very thick Kaahdiff accent, was clearly ignoring the system). James was immediately enticed by the fountain pen display, as he was looking 
	for a second model, and the shop had a selection of small brands whom he'd never heard of before, and he was very impressed. Matthew meanwhile headed over to the 
	pencils section to get Freya something for her birthday. Matthew bought a few coloured pencils, some very soft black pencils and a charcoal stick for her, and even 
	managed to get a loyalty card at the shop, at long last. James meanwhile settled on a Abbey Autograph pen, which he was very pleased at both the quality and 
	the value for money. RIP.
	<br><br>
	We then decided to head for Queen Street. James led the way up towards Cardiff Market and Cardiff Castle... which was wrong. Matthew then led the way... somewhere... 
	and got slightly lost. This was also wrong. Matthew then finally remembered the correct route, past Primark, WHSmith and the Capital Shopping Centre, all the way to 
	Sainsbury's, where we went in and bought ourselves lunch and crisps for later.
	<br><br>
	James couldn't quite wait for lunchtime, so immediately brought out his drink of choice - a blue Innocent smoothie. Why had he chosen it? Well, it was blue! He gave 
	it a sip, and uttered the immortal line,<br>
	<strong>Mmm, that's... that's awful!<br>
	Awful is my word for amazing!</strong>
	<br><br>
	No matter how amazing the smoothie, he had to put it away when we reached Grangetown station, as we had to fumble for our tickets and put our masks on. The station 
	guard gave James a hard time for attempting to cross the ticket line without a mask (despite them only having been compulsory for 48 hours), but we eventually made 
	it up to the platform and got on our train to our next destination - Grangetown.
	<br><br>
	It had obviously been a long time since Matthew had been on a train, especially a train in Cardiff, as he seemed genuinely perplexed when the train curved its way 
	around the city centre and started approaching Cardiff Central. Had we just evaded the fares/tricked the ticket barriers? It certainly seemed we had! This was enough 
	to send Matthew into a fit of laughter, as we had not only managed to evade fares and trick the ticket barriers on a day when we weren't even yet allowed on public 
	transport to begin with, but we had managed to do so through sheer incompetance! Welcome to Nutty Trains, they say. Reckless, ill-planned and now illegal adventures, 
	coming soon during a pandemic near you!

<p>
	The trip down to Grangetown was mostly uneventful, but when we arrived at the station, we had reached our de facto terminus for the day. We all know the rules by now, 
	and we were hardly going to pass up an opportunity for a mask photo. Nwotegen: Tick!
</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Grangetown.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p> 
	We left the station and headed down the stairs, to the alleyway connecting the Ikea car park with the station, passing the dodgy car mechanics on the way. We felt 
	great about ourselves - this was just like old times! Walking through dodgy places in the middle of nowhere, with no real idea where we were headed... except this 
	time it was in Chocky times!
	<br><br>
	We crossed through the Ikea car park, only to find that all of our usual (1) entrances were blocked off by barriers in order to form a socially distanced queue. Damn 
	staff, always pandering to cars! Don't they ever spare a thought for the nutters who <i>walk</i> to Ikea? Nevertheless, we wandered our way around until we found an 
	entrance, slipped our way in and headed in the direction of the queue. We had to cross a few barriers to get to the end of the queue itself. Of course, we failed 
	miserably at this. Matthew decided to go under the barrier... right as James was stepping over it, thereby managing to hoist the chains straight into James's crotch...
	<br><br>
	We queued for the best part of 45 minutes, killing time standing in the car park. During this time, James revealed his true intentions for the continuation of our 
	#IKEAmeansIKEA trip, and hoisted a camera stand set out of his bag. James, as de facto head of MathSoc (and the only real mathematician there), had been selected to 
	film some of the award videos for their annual awards ceremony that Friday. Kind of. He had been given the envelopes with the names of the shortlists and winners, and 
	had been told to leave the sealed until Friday, when he would reveal the lucky winner via a Zoom call. Except, this being James, he was going to do nothing of the 
	sort. Using his poor internet as an excuse, he decided he would instead film himself reading out the award shortlists and winners beforehand, and send the videos to 
	the organiser of the ceremony... at the last minute, so that she wouldn't know the twist...
	<br><br>
	1 video was to be filmed in IKEA!
	<br><br>
	We eventually made it into the shop, ascended the escalator, and spent a few minutes searching for a trolley to place the camera equipment on. We climbed to the top 
	floor, went back down in the lift, found a trolley on the 1st floor, went back up in the lift, realised that we had left the lift on the wrong side of the one-way 
	system, went back down in the lift, went around to the other side of the lift and went back up to the top floor one last time. Finally, we had made it. We continued 
	down the path towards the displays, and immediately found a comfy, homely-looking sofa. This was a perfect filming location! Here, we would film the awards video! 
	We spent ages setting the camera stand up on the front of the trolley, adjusting the angle so that he could be captured both sitting down in his 'living room' (which 
	had a suspiciously large number of IKEA price tags attached), as well as walking down the aisle, when he would reveal to MathSoc that <s>he actually lives in IKEA</s> 
	it wasn't actually his living room, and that he was in IKEA. Unfortunately, this was harder than it seemed. Every time a staff member walked past, we would hide the 
	camera to make us seem less suspicious, and every few seconds more people would arrive, <i>actually shopping for stuff</i>. Disgraceful. When we finally managed to 
	get the entire clip on film without being interupted, his head was almost cut off the top of the film, the audio quality was terrible, and the entire thing was rushed 
	out of fear. James criticised Matthew for having no standards of decency, and Matthew laughed like a maniacal IPN. Nevertheless, a Plan B would have to be sought. 
	<br><br>
	Despite this being James's video, Matthew saw an opportunity to be nuts, and so rejected his sensible idea to film the video outside IKEA, or in the IKEA car park. 
	No, this video was to be filmed in the showroom, or we weren't worthy of the title IPN! We found a nice little desk tucked away in the office section of the showroom, 
	towards the back corner of the building. This was perfect! James sat down at the table whilst Matthew manoeuvered the filming trolley into position. Lights, Camera, 
	Action!
	<br><br>
	"Hello MathSoc, I am here to announce some of the 2020 Annual MathSoc Awards, and I'm definitely not filming this in IKEA!"<br>
	<i>(Lifts up conveniently placed IKEA mug in front of him, with price tag still attached)</i>
	<br><br>
	With our primary mission accomplished (including the guest appearance of the tannoy and a baby screaming at the end), we headed downstairs with our still empty 
	trolley to fulfil our secondary mission - buying some useless random crap. Matthew spotted a dish mat, and decided this was a suitable start, even though it wasn't 
	particularly crap, as he might actually use it. James countered with a light-up house, made from luminous yellow plastic. This was undeniably random and crap. We 
	headed through the towering aisles of flatpack furniture, before arriving at our favourite section of the entire store - the bargain section! Here, Matthew bought a 
	discounted IKEA cookbook, despite being completely unable to cook any meals more complex than absolute basics, and James bought some <s>metal snowflake coasters</s>, 
	shurikens, meaning he won this round. We queued up, paid for our items, avoided the queue for the bistro and walked out, pleased with our veritable haul of shit.

<p>
	We then wandered up though Grangetown to a park, eventually found our way in through the seemingly sole gate, and sat down as far away from the screaming children 
	and REDACTED family playing cricket as possible. We ate our lunch, spotted a few trains on the nearby viaduct and admired our collection of shit, whilst also 
	discussing Matthew's family's recent 'Healthweek' initiative, whereby they were meant to become more healthy by improving their diets and doing more exercise... 
	without going out and doing any exercise, reducing portion sizes or cutting back on the chocolate and desserts everyday. James was rather gobsmacked by the portion 
	sizes and lack of greens that Matthew spoke of.
	<br><br>
	We then finished our lunch and walked back to Grangetown station, rather exhausted by our first train adventure in almost 6 months. Despite it being only 
	mid-afternoon, we returned to Cardiff Central and then caught the train home, ready for a longer train adventure to unexplored regions next time!
</p>

<div class="content">
<p>
	Getting tipsy in a pub next to a castle in the pouring rain? This seems like perfectly normal behaviour!
</p>
<p>
	After our escapade to Cardiff, "the big city", according to Mrs Arthur, James was now banned from any further adventures to the east for the time being, and this 
	included Swansea. Therefore, from now on, our R0 adventures would have to be West Wales adventures, to James's delight. This meant Matthew would have to catch an 
	earlier train than James, which would be... interesting, given Matthew's known perfect punctuality.
	<br><br>
	Nevertheless, Matthew actually arrived at the station just about on time (despite setting off late), collected his tickets from the machine, passed through the ticket 
	barrier and sprinted over the bridge and onto the other platform, making it onto the train with about 10 seconds to spare. He then sat on the train until it reached 
	Swansea, reading his book (by Michael Collins). 
	<br><br>
	The train pulled into Swansea, where Matthew stretched his legs, wandering up and down the island platform. Here, he spotted the fabled SWR TfW train - a sprinter 
	which TfW nicked from SWR, kept the livery and stuck a TfW logo on the side. Fantasteg. The train was definitely not stolen. Absolutely not. We would later nickname 
	this train "Jezza", and Jezza managed to appear in a great number of our adventures after this. Sadly, today we were unable to travel on Jezza, but fortunately the 
	Milford Haven train (which we were taking to Carmarthen) had a number of interesting passengers, including 2 Chinese tourists and a "fat bloke who fills half the 
	carriage" - Matthew, 2K2X.
	<br><br>
	James, meanwhile was rushing to try and make his very tight (-1 minute) connection from his bus to Gowerton station, and there was such a high chance he wouldn't 
	make it that Matthew was prepared to leave the train. Luckily, when the train pulled into the platform, James was waiting there, and the nuttiness could begin!

<p>
	Heading west for the first time in 11 months was exciting for both James and Matthew, especially considering that our only trip west had been Sampi 6, in which we 
	rattled through all 3 branch lines in a single outing. For the first time, we could actually choose the destinations we wanted to explore, rather than be stuck in 
	the shitty termini. Before long, the train was pulling into Carmarthen, where, thanks to chock, we would have to wait for our connection, as only Milford Haven trains 
	passed through the town without terminating. Annoyingly, we would discover that there always seemed to be a 1 hour time delay between the Milford Haven trains and 
	the Pembroke Dock trains, meaning plenty of waiting about.
	<br><br>
	We headed into the town, across the bridge, through the bus station, and into the town centre. We had a wander around for a bit, before heading into M&S for some 
	crisps, as our tradition dictates. Matthew bought the classic Salt and Vinegar, and James tried out Sweet Chili. James paid, to get the discounted price for the 2 
	bags, but was disdainful of Matthew's attempts to pay him back in "chockbits" (coins). After getting slightly lost behind the shop, we then went to Coffee#1 and had 
	tea and coffee to wake ourselves up. Matthew had the special Ceylon (which had bergamot in and was floral) and James had a coffee. Matthew's tea came in a tea pouch, 
	to his great amusement. He spent quite a few minutes standing by the bin, removing the tea pouch from the tea and photographing it for Freya, whilst James became 
	increasingly anxious as the chock police with their foam chock batons, closed in to take us to Room 5. We then headed leisurely back to the station, as we still 
	had time to kill.
	<br><br>
	Carmarthen station was guarded by 2 security people, whom we'd encounter every time we left the station over the summer. During this adventure though, they were far 
	more concerned about compliance with covid regulations than they were with people actually paying their fares. MASKS ON! We dithered between the platforms, switching 
	back and forth, whilst also laughing at the shitty rolling stock that was pulling into the station. We crossed over to the other platform and boarded our train at the 
	one entrance (out of 4) which hadn't been taped off. Mmm. Social distancey. 
	<br><br>
	The train pulled off towards Tenby, and we were on our way! Admittedly, we spent most of the journey on the way down sharing memes, as we'd already been through 
	this section of the line, and thanks to chock, we couldn't jump on and off even if we wanted to. Cue plenty of Mao and Xi memes, mangoes and sparrows from James, 
	which Matthew countered with Australian Star Wars election posters. All of them, however, pale in comparison to this, which Matthew pulled out as his ace:
</p>
	<center><iframe frameborder="0" height="360px" width="640px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cre0in5n-1E" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>
<p>
	After passing Tenby, the army shooting ranges at Penally, and the campsite straddling the railway near Manorbier, we finally arrived at the penultimate stop on the 
	line, Pembroke, where we alighted to find a very nicely decorated single-platform station. We wandered down through the car park, and crossed under the railway 
	bridge, before running across a junction leading onto a blind bend, screaming "run me over 'en", to the utter shock of the 2 chinese tourists we'd met in Swansea, 
	and had followed our route ever since. They were our fwiends!
	<br><br>
	We wandered into the town centre, keeping our eyes peeled for pubs participating in Rishi's 'Eat out to help out' scheme, cafes, or even just shops to grab some 
	lunch. We were, however left bitterly disappointed. There seemed to be nothing there at all! Fortunately, at the last moment, as we entered the touristy street 
	leading to the castle, we found a fish and chip shop (Rowlies), and bought some fish and chips, before heading down to the river/moat to sit in the beer garden and 
	enjoy them. In the rain. Oh, what a wonderful British summer extravaganza! Sitting eating fish and chips in the pouring rain, in a beer garden over an algae-filled 
	castle moat. Pure, unadulterated bliss. We talked about how this kind of thing never happens much nowadays, as everyone wants to go on holiday to Lanzarote, Zante or 
	Ibiza. James disagreed, saying that the number of emmets in Cornwall meant that they were all invading God's Country!
	<br><br>
	We finished our fish and chips and climbed up the castle motte to the entrance, where we fumbled with our phones to scan the QR codes from our tickets, we passed 
	through the gatehouse and we were in! Yay! We immediately cut across the wet grass (ruining James's canvas shoes) to the first tower on our right (the Henry VII 
	Tower), where we saw a lovely dungeon, before climbing up the spiral staircase to see the rest of the rooms in the tower. It was at this point that we discovered 
	that James is unable to negotiate spiral staircases. He stumbled his way up, falling over at regular intervals, all to the sound of Matthew laughing hysterically.
	<br><br>
	One of the first rooms we encountered was the diorama of Henry VII's birth. Naturally, James had to have a photo in front of it. We ran down the corridor that Matthew 
	remembered from his school trip to the castle over a decade ago (the corridor seemed a lot smaller now) to a room with a large fireplace (James approved) and a view 
	of the local gypsy camp (James also approved), before going down another spiral staircase to the courtyard (cue more stumbling and tripping from James). After a 
	quick look at a garderobe, we climbed up more stairs to the battlements (by the Westgate Tower), where we could see for miles! We had a great view of the moat, a 
	fantastic view of the old houses in the town centre, and a perfect view of the gypsy camp. Noice.
	<br><br>
	We attempted to climb up to the flag pole, but it was closed due to chock. This was one of many such disappointments. Pembroke Castle is normally a warren of 
	interconnecting corridors and staircases, and it is very very easy to get lost (more fun that way, see?). But thanks to chock, social distancing and one-way systems, 
	there would be little chance to lose James in some dungeon somewhere. Damn it!
	<br><br>
	We then followed the battlements around towards the great hall, passing a smithy, a herb garden, a chapel and yet more passageways which were closed off. Sad. 
	Fortunately, many of the rooms in the great hall section of the castle were still open. We saw the Norman Hall and Northern Hall, where James also managed to utter 
	some profanity right before we rounded a corner and came face-to-face with a young family. However, to Matthew's utter despondency, the cavern underneath the castle 
	(the highlight of the entire trip, not least for the enormous spiral staircase that led down there) was closed! What was the point of the trip now?	
</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Sane.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	This was the point. James decided that the sane course of action here would be to crawl into the fireplace, in front of a large crowd of people, and pretend to 
	be the serving boy. Look at how wonderfully sane he looks!
	<br><br>
	We spent a couple of minutes in the pouring rain, attempting to find any rooms or corridors which hadn't been covid-sealed. James then fucked off for a few minutes 
	somewhere whilst Matthew read a display about William Marshall, 1<sup>st</sup> Earl of Pembroke (which was very, very interesting)... all in a shower of rain.
	<br><br>
	Meanwhile, in a hovel, in Pembroke Castle. James is shivering of cold, his feet rotting away from the trenchfoot that has now taken ahold of him and he is feeling as 
	sane as ever. After deciding to be a serving boy, he say in the hovel as many people went past and were scared of his existence in the only dry alcove of the castle.
	Things were turning dire, he feel had no longer have feeling and his nose was following suit, it was almost time for a drink.
	<br><br>
	We then reunited as the rain dissipated, and climbed up onto the other battlements for some more pictures. We then went to investigate the giant map in the centre of 
	the castle courtyard. Pembroke Castle has a giant map of Wales, with all the major castles/abbeys/other historical sites shown as large, named, coloured icons on the 
	map, and all the other minor castles/abbeys/historical sites accordingly given smaller, unnamed icons. So, here we had a little meta-NT adventure - all the castles! 
	We quickly ticked off all the castles in the dense region of Dyfed, jumped between the multitude of minor locations in Glamorganshire, before heading up north through 
	sheepland to the north of Wales, seeing Conway, Caernarfon and Chester to name a few. We finished off at the northernmost point that James had ever been to! Wow! Not 
	bad for a trip to Carmarthen!
	<br><br>
	We then headed for the penultimate tower (the Barbican/Northgate Towers), where James had a real spastic moment on the stairs, and seemed to forget how to put one 
	foot in front of the other. The photos and videos Matthew took of him dying on the spiral staircase will haunt him forever. Matthew meanwhile posed for his own photo 
	in a fireplace.
	<br><br>
	Finally, we tackled yet more spiral staircases in the Gatehouse. We started off in a room detailing the history of Pembroke Castle, and how it was constructed over 
	time by its various owners, before moving onto a display about the French "invasion" of Pembroke which was terribly planned, carried out by convicts and stopped by a 
	group of local women and infantrymen. These infantrymen became a unit in later years, and the subsequent display was about their own history, as the only unit to 
	have battle honours from a British land battle. We then climbed more stairs to see the civil war exhibition, which included yet more fascinating dioramas of people 
	being murdered (Pembroke Castle was a focal point during the English Civil War), before finishing off in the final diorama of a medieval family eating in the castle 
	dining room - with only knives.
	<br><br>
	We then headed out of the castle, jumped an entire queue of people waiting to leave (breaking social distancing in the process) and walking to the bottom of the 
	motte, back in the town centre. Unfortunately, as enjoyable as the castle visit had been, it had only lasted 90 minutes. Therefore, James came up with a plan!
	<br><br>
	We descended back towards the beer garden by the moat, to see if we could enter the Royal George pub there, as they were participating in the 'Eat out to help out' 
	scheme. Unfortunately, everyone else had had the same idea, and we were told the pub was full. So, it was time for plan B! We crossed the river and walked into the 
	pub on the opposite bank. We entered around the back, sat down and gave our contact details. James was taking Matthew drinking!
	<br><br>
	James, being a seasoned hasher, is now an alcoholic. He not only drinks gin and port like they are water, but he has developed an ability to down pints too. For 
	Matthew though, this was his first time in a pub (excluding Spoons). This was all very new and alien to him, and according to James, he seemed to revert back to 
	Year 10 Matthew - somewhat mouse-like. James ordered a pint of cider for himself and a half-pint for Matthew to try. After a minute or two, our drinks were brought 
	over, and James immediately started gulping his down. Matthew on the other hand...
	<br><br>
	<strong>James</strong>: Matthew, what are you doing? Do you not like the smell?<br>
	<strong>Matthew</strong>: No, I'm just investigating it<br>
	<strong>James</strong>: Matthew, it is okay! I'm not trying to poison you!<br>
	<strong>Matthew</strong>: I like sniffing things, okay?
	<br><br>
	As we were now getting drunk in a pub, we came to the conclusion that we must have already exhausted absolutely everything that there was to do in Pembroke... 2 
	hours ahead of schedule. As there is nothing Matthew likes less than wandering around purposeless, we decided that the best course of action would be to leave shortly 
	and catch the earlier train. Matthew had a few sips of his cider before deciding he didn't like it, James downed his entire pint in one go, James went up to pay, and 
	we left, with about 15 minutes to do what had seemed like a half an hour walk on the way out. Whilst tipsy.
	<br><br>
	So we walked through Pembroke, talking about diverse alcohol-related subjects such as the running trend of James being forced into trying new alcohols in a variety 
	of amusing and strange situations, before deciding he loves it and getting as drunk as a fish; and Matthew's taste buds seemingly being able to detect even trace 
	quantities of alcohol, despite the regular abuse he subjects his tongue to, thanks to his habit of drinking almost-boiling hot tea. Fortunately though, despite 
	James's lack of sobriety, actually knowing where we were going this time meant that we arrived at the station a few minutes ahead of schedule. We walked past our 
	Chinese fwiends and had the obligatory station sign photo, before boarding our train home.
</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Pembroke.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	Unfortunately, it was only roughly 3 o'clock, and neither of us wanted to return home so quickly. We decided to look up stuff we could do to kill time along the 
	way. James suggested Laugharne, but that was too hard to access. Matthew suggested Pembrey, but the walking time was excessive even for him. We checked Burry Port and 
	Ferryside but found nothing. Then we checked Carmarthen, where we'd have to spend an hour anyway, and discovered a tea shop - Tea Traders. This would be our second 
	port of call on this adventure!
	<br><br>
	The train pulled into Carmarthen, where once again the security guards enforced mask-wearing and social distancing, and we crossed the bridge back into town, a 
	well-trodden route by this point. Matthew remarked that it was sad that the tiny funfair which had popped up by the bridge during Sampi 6 was now absent thanks to 
	chock. We entered the town, got slightly lost on the way to the shop, but eventually found it and stood outside awkwardly, as the shop sign said it was closed 
	already. Just as we were about to turn around, the owner came outside and invited us in, explaining that he had only 'closed' early due to the town centre being 
	abandoned when the rain hit earlier. We stepped inside and were greeted by a sight far better than we had imagined!
	<br><br>
	All along the wall were shelves and shelves of tea! This was an absolutely vast collection of all types, from Black and White teas, to Green and Oolong, all the way 
	to a specialty tea that was grown in the Vale of Glamorgan (Peterston tea estate)! This last tea was descended from the Cornish Tregothnan plantation, and this year 
	was their first crop (which explained why it was rather pricey). The owner introduced himself as Paul, and we introduced ourselves in turn. We started a long chat 
	about what teas we prefer, with Matthew saying that he liked black teas (especially Ceylon) and some Japanese green teas (Sencha), with James saying that he liked 
	<b>no</b> black teas, and only liked Chinese green teas. Paul said that he preferred Oolong. We chose some teas to buy later, and then Paul offered to make us a 
	complimentary cup of tea each, from any tea we wanted (<a href="https://teatraders.co.uk/" target="_blank">Tea Traders</a> doubles as both a tea shop and a teahouse, 
	so usually you can go and have a cup of tea and a scone during the day, if you don't want to buy a full bag of tea).
	<br><br>
	We sat down and continued talking, whilst Paul made us some tea each. Matthew went for some Yunnan Orange Pekoe, which he fully intends to buy next time he takes 
	Freya to the shop in Carmarthen. Matthew would probably say that Yunnan tea is his new favourite, as it has a really good depth of flavour for a black tea, without 
	being overpowering enough to require milk (like Assam). The jury is still out upon whether or not Yunnan would displace his perennial favourite, Ceylon, or whether 
	the recent contender Lapsang Souchong would best them both. Other teas which caught Matthew's eye were the Nilgiri and Nepalese teas. Despite this, Matthew ended up 
	buying a Kagoshima blend of Genmaicha (sencha mixed with toasted rice) from Kyushu, and Fujian Iron Goddess of Mercy Oolong (Tie Kuan Yim) as a birthday present for 
	Freya (which turned out to be her favourite variety of Oolong, after she checked on Reddit).
	<br><br>
	James had a cup of special 'bug bitten' tea, where insects are encouraged to bite the tea leaves before harvest, changing their chemical composition and producing a 
	unique flavour of tea. He enjoyed it very much, and Paul had the second infusion of the tea. James enjoyed his tea so much that he proclaimed that perhaps he liked 
	black tea after all, only to be told that this was in fact oolong tea, a partially-oxidised variety somewhere between green and black tea, with the ability to survive 
	multiple infusions, each yielding a different flavour profile. This then started a long conversation about different teas, Camellia Sinensis (including the Assamica 
	variety), the Opium Wars, and Britain's attempts to grow teas outside China, which were honestly rather funny - we smuggled Camellia Sinensis Sinensis into the Assam 
	region, and tried to grow it ourselves, but failed. We then paid Chinese tea masters to come over to help us grow it, only to be told "Why are you trying to grow this 
	[Sinensis] here? There is a native tea plant [Assamica] which has already been growing here all this time!"
	<br><br>
	After learning that Paul gives tea talks in non-Covid times, we finished our teas, and went to buy some more to take home with us. Matthew bought his Genmaicha and 
	Tie Kuan Yim, whilst James chose Bug Bitten and Mao Jian. We said goodbye and headed out into Carmarthen once more, only to find that we'd missed our train (worth it 
	though) and would have to kill an hour. We wandered around the empty town for a bit, laughing at the graffiti on an accupuncture clinic, before getting insufferably 
	bored and heading down towards the river. It was probably at this point that Matthew developed his hatred of Carmarthen, as he had spent far longer in the small, empty 
	town than he was able to withstand. Fortunately for him, this wouldn't be his final visit this summer!
	<br><br>
	Here, we finally brought out our crisps and started eating them, whilst sitting in the light mizzle, facing the freezing cold torrent of a river beneath us. We 
	chatted for a bit about how different this summer was, and how long ago last summer seemed and read the partial account of Koppa 2 that Matthew had written recently, 
	before Matthew's mum had a fit and called him/texted him n times because he was out 3 nanoseconds past 6 o'clock. James posed for yet another picture, crouching down 
	inside a little plastic boat toy, munching on his crisps, before we started to walk back across the river, to the station, and onto our train home.

<button type="button" class="collapsible">R<sub>0</sub>=4: "This'll be the bliddy wasp adventure in a minute!"</button>
<div class="content">
<p>
	Being abandoned in a tiny rural village with only 2 trains a day, no sense of direction, a quest to find white woolly deer, a bunch of Karens and some illegal 
	heat? What a perfect idea!
	<br><br>
	It was time to head west yet again, out into the pristine countryside once more, to Londoner Matthew's utter dismay. James had been banned from visiting both Cardiff 
	and Swansea thanks to the chock, and missed the clean and beautiful countryside, so was determined to head west. We had a choice between visiting the Pembrokeshire 
	coast, or some random village on the HoW line, but because of the predicted thunderstorm and Thatcherite Matthew's newly-rekindled revulsion of buses, it was off to 
	mid Wales!
	<br><br>
	As we had discovered in 2019, there are not many trains that travel up HoW, so unlike most of our adventures, this one started at a very reasonable time in the 
	morning - Matthew didn't even have to run to the station! This was fortunate, as James was hungover, and absolutely needed the extra time to stagger down to 
	the bus, and go on a magical mystery tour of the chock-filled Gowerton council estate. Fantasteg!
	<br><br>
	James eventually arrived at the station, just minutes before the train arrived, having thought he would miss it. Unfortunately, whilst on the platform, he met 
	a group of Karens loudly chattering in the way that Karens do. Even worse, they were headed to Llandeilo, just like us. We decided to stay the fuck away from 
	them. The train made its way to Llanelli, at which point what seemed like the entire train disembarked, waiting to board the HoW train. We stayed far away from 
	those plebs, at the other end of the platform. We eventually boarded our clackety, clapped-out Sprinter, and the train started moving up the line. Just like we 
	always do on these trains, we admired the view out of the rattling windows as the entire train threatened to fall apart underneath us. Still, could be worse - 
	we passed the site of a recent train derailment and oil spillage. Weirdly, it kind of reminded Matthew of passing the nuclear reactors at Lydney. Yummy yummy 
	carcinogens! Matthew also spent much of the first few stations tracking what appeared to be a parallel line to ours (which turned out to be the Swansea District).
	<br><br>
	Most of the journey up was very lovely - it was nice taking our time travelling along the line without jumping on and off, despite the ramping heat. James was 
	enamoured by the little villages and rolling fields, whilst Matthew looked out at the Martian-equivalent landscape of smog-free <i>green</i> with fear.
	<br><br>
	As we passed Pontarddulais, the temperature was now significant, and Matthew relocated to the shaded half of the train, followed by James, as we sought refuge 
	from the glare of the sun. James opened the slammy windows for some circulation. It was at this point that a wasp entered the train and flew around, pestering 
	us for absolutely ages, flying all around us. Bleddy Wasp! Shortly after we had dispatched the first wasp, we were met by another! This one was even more annoying 
	than the last!<br>
	James: <strong>"This'll be the bliddy wasp adventure in a minute!"</strong>
	<br><br>
	It was eventually our station, Ffairfach, so we disembarked and watched the train recede into the distance. Ffairfach was a lovely little shaded station, and one 
	of the few request stops we had missed in <a href="./sampi.html">Sampi 3</a>. It had a level crossing at one end, and some strange street lamps illuminating the 
	station at night. We saw a trainspotter disembark from the train at the same time as us to photograph the departing DMU and we absolutely did not do the same 
	#notwritingdownnumbers. We seemed rather confused by the gentleman, who seemed as lost here as we were. Nevertheless, as this was effectively our terminus, it 
	was time for our picture:
</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Ffairfach.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	Ffairfach is a very small village which we had believed to be in absolutely the middle of nowhere. We set off left along the pavement of the main (and almost 
	only) road through the village to investigate what seemed to be some sort of mill building with a massive chimney (it was some sort of local bakery if 
	memory serves me correctly), before doing a 180 and walking towards Llandeilo. Along the way, we complained about the mounting heat, and discussed "Drunk NT". 
	Fortunately, Matthew illustrated that this would be a terrible idea by lurching out onto the road drunkenly, whilst completely sober... and then we almost 
	were run over by a massive truck.
	<br><br>
	After only 5 minutes spent in our destination, we had already reached the edge of the village. Surely this must be some sort of record for 'least amount of time 
	spent at intended destination' or something. We immediately set about climbing the enormous viaduct crossing the Towy into Llandeilo. Upon realising that 
	Llandeilo and Ffairfach were in fact contiguous, Matthew was deeply upset. <br>
	Matthew: Why the fuck does TfW have 2 stations in Llandeilo? Ffairfach doesn't <i>deserve</i> its own station! It ought to be called 'Llandeilo South' or something! <br>
	James: <i>I don't know!!</i> <br>
	Nevertheless, we were now in Llandeilo, so it was time for James to put on his best Menna impression and impress the locals! James liked the sign "Afon Towi" on 
	the bridge over the river, so just started screaming "AFON TOWI" at the signpost... because funny.
</p>
	<center><video width="40%" controls><source src="./resources/video/Afon Towy.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>
<p>
	We climbed the very steep (albeit pretty) hill into the town, attempting at all times to stay in the shade, which Matthew intepreted as "run to stay in the shade 
	of the passing lorry", almost killing James in the process. Fortunately, at the top of the hill we reached the narrower streets of the town centre, and set out 
	trying to find somewhere to eat. This, however, was a problem, as Matthew refused to actually spend money. O me miserum! So instead of actually having something 
	nice to eat in one of the innumerable sweet cafes and restaurants lining the streets, we instead trekked down the hill to the supermarket, and bought some bread 
	rolls. Never let it be said that Matthew doesn't know how to celebrate an occasion! Having said that, the supermarket was beautifully cool - we stayed twice as 
	long just to enjoy the air conditioning!
	<br><br>
	We walked up yet another hill, passing a "Cave Canem" mosaic on someone's door, taken directly from CLC, before eventually reaching Penlan Park. We climbed to the 
	top of the hill, found a bench in the shade, and enjoyed our bread rolls. For about an hour, James explained to Matthew all about hashing and his history of hashing, 
	right back to the hash he did in Cambridge. Hashing really is James's sport - it is energetic, completely bats, and he gets utterly sozzled every morning - what's 
	not to like? We continued to sit there after we had finished our lunch, in the forlorn hope that the heat of the day would pass soon, and spent some of the 
	intervening time being attacked by yet another wasp - this really was the bleddy wasp adventure!
	<br><br>
	After that, we wandered over to the vantage point, to look over Llandeilo and Ffairfach, and could see for miles. If the weather wasn't so terribly hot, it 
	would have been a beautiful day. But, unfortunately, it was, so we retreated back to the shade, and made our way down the hill along twisted shady paths, looking for 
	and entrance to our intended destination (Dinefwr Park), which bordered the park. Finding no entrance, we made our way to the exit and instead walked along the 
	road to the main entrance.
	<br><br>
	Dinefwr Park had in fact always been our intended destination. After James was forbidden from visiting either of the "big cities", his mum had suggested that we 
	visit somewhere nice and rural... like Dinefwr Park - it had a castle, plenty of green, and some deer! Lots and lots of deer. James had to see the deer. He had 
	to take many pictures of the many deer that were here in the park. Deer. Park. Pictures. Fun. "Have a good time Jamie!".
	<br><br>
	Ha. Ha. Ha.
	<br><br>
	Yet instead, here we were, walking alongside a road in the blazing sun, with no pavement to protect us from being run over, no shade to protect us from the sun, 
	and nothing to protect us from the chock. We ran across the road to the other side, in front of the oncoming traffic, so as to stay on a grassy verge and not have 
	to walk on the tarmac itself. We then spent the next 10 minutes trying to outrun a lawnmower as the path undulated up and down, all whilst the sun beat down upon us, 
	the temperature rose, and we became more feverish. The temperature was now "illegally hot".<br>
	James: Matthew, why on earth did you bring your coat today?<br>
	Matthew: I learned my lessons from before - the weather said it would rain, so I brought my coat!<br>
	James: But Matthew, it is the hottest day of the year!<br>
	Matthew: Oh really? I hadn't noticed!
	<br><br>
	Eventually we returned to the road and the shade, having outpaced the lawnmower, and were crippled by exhaustion. Yet, in the name of seeing some deer, we pressed on. 
	We passed through a gate, and tracked down through a large field, avoiding the many piles of droppings. Yet it was here that we saw something amazing - a whole flock 
	of very rare white, woolly deer! James's Mum had been right all along! There were dozens, if not close to 100 of these white woolly deer! Such a sight had never before 
	graced our eyes! We went up very close and took pictures, whilst James started calling to the deer to entice them over:<br>
	James: BAAAAAAAAAA
</p>
	<center><video width="40%" controls><source src="./resources/video/White Woolly Deer.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>
<p>
	We walked all the way to the end of the field, at which point the ruined castle came into view, looming over the valley, shrouded in thick overgrowth. The path onwards 
	to the castle winded its way into the thick forest ahead of us, all but disappearing. Unfortunately, the time until our train departed was also disappearing, so we 
	decided at this point to turn back, back past the deer, back through the field, and back to the shaded road. We decided this time to walk directly along the road, as 
	it was simply too hot to walk in the sun. Despite the heat, we walked very quickly, as we not only had to make it all the way to the town, but we wanted to return to 
	the supermarket to buy water, all before finding the station. Matthew, as always, proposed that we ran, but James said he'd rather take a bus than run in this weather.
	<br><br>
	We walked briskly out of the park, back into town (making fun of Welsh on the way), and went into the air-conditioned supermarket once more to buy some water. On the 
	entire journey there, Matthew fretted about whether or not the station had ticket barriers - to save himself a few quid, he only had a ticket to Ffairfach, so he 
	was very worried that he'd be stranded out in the middle of nowhere, unable to board the train. James eventually reassured Matthew by finding a Google Maps view of 
	the station, after which, Matthew calmed down. After this, we passed a group of <i>children</i>, and then set off in search of the station. James brought out his 
	phone, put on his Menna accent, and spent the ensuing 5 minutes yelling at his phone for directions to "CHLLAN-DAI-LO". Unfortunately, the phone couldn't speak Menna.
	<br><br>
	After getting only slightly lost in a few twisty residential streets and cul-de-sacs, we arrived at the station at the arse end of the town, walked over to the shelter, 
	and rested away from the sun, glaring at the gang of youths nearby, and praying that the Karens from earlier were left behind. The last thing we did before leaving was 
	to have our obligatory photo, looking far more bedraggled and sweaty than we had done before:
</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Llandeilo.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	The train arrived, and we boarded our sprinter in SWR livery: "Jezza"! We sat down, and started to make our way home, as we were exhausted. This was yet another 
	section of railway that Matthew had semi-accidentally managed to fare-dodge in just a few days. Yay.
	<br><br>
	But that wasn't quite the end. It was only 3PM - how on earth were we already thinking about going home? This couldn't possibly be! By the time we were passing 
	Ammanford, and the temperature was dropping, we felt like we should do something else to extend the adventure. After ruling out Llanelli and Carmarthen, we 
	decided to head for Gowerton, where James could show Matthew all the sights in glorious technicolour!
	<br><br>
	There was one last shock on the way home. As we approached Bynea, the last missing station on the first section of the HoW line, the train started to slow down. 
	Wait, could it be? Would we be able to tick off our first station, done in proper NT hop-off, hop-on style?
	<br><br>
	YES! The train stopped, and Matthew and James leapt off to catch a photo of the station sign (and for once, Matthew was on camera duty!). At last, a proper station. 
	TICK!
</p>
<center><img src="./resources/photos/Bynea.jpg" width="40%"></center>
<p>
	We later arrived in Gowerton, disembarked and walked up to the main road. James wanted to tell Matthew about his time in Gowerton School, and reminisce about 
	Ffynone and pre-Covid, so that is exactly what we did for over an hour. We walked down the cycle path towards Swansea, making it halfway to Waunarlwydd before 
	doubling back on ourselves, James not wanting to accidentally end up in Swansea and defy his no-city order. Instead, we went up back to the town, and wandered 
	around various streets, passing his old school, where he pointed out where his favourite (and least favourite) places there were, passing houses of old friends, 
	and passing various other places he remembered vividly, before joining Ffynone. He also told Matthew about all his old friends.
	<br><br>
	Eventually we made our way back to the station and sat on the station wall, waiting for the train, talking about cliques in Ffynone. The train arrived, and 
	Matthew headed home, whilst James waited for his bus.
	<br><br>
	As an unexpected addendum, Matthew met Freya and 3 of his college friends that evening, completely out of the blue. So despite the heat, it turned out to be 
	an excellent adventure.
</p>

	The train at platform Dai is the 1023 serive to god knows where. It has been sitting here for god knows how long and it is god knows how late, calling at 
	Llanshitole, Castellcrap and Timbuk-fucking-to. Please social distance and stay the fuck away from each other. Karen! MASK! ON!
	<br><br>
	Well, it was too good to be true. Whilst Matthew may have arrived at the station with so much time to spare on the previous adventure, this time he screamed out of 
	bed, absolutely exhausted, and sprinted to the station like his life depended on it. He ran almost the entire distance to the train and could barely breathe through 
	his mask by the time he arrived. He was only just through the ticket barrier when the train to Swansea rocked up, and had to sprint up the stairs, along the 
	bridge, down the stairs and through the closing train door to make it on time.
	<br><br>
	This had all been because Matthew's usual train, the 8:46, was suddenly missing from the timetable, forcing him to catch the 8:37... except he left as if he was 
	about to catch the 8:46. Regardless, by the time he reached Swansea, he was exhausted, so decided to go to McDonalds for some cheap coffee to tide him over. 
	He wandered out of the station, down High Street, and through Castle Square to McDonalds, whereupon he ordered himself a coffee. And waited. And waited. And 
	waited. They were really taking their time. And waited. If they didn't hurry up soon, then catching the train would be hard. And waited. What were they doing 
	back there? And waited. Were they growing the beans themselves? And waited. And waited. And waited. HURRY UP AND MAKE THE DAMN COFFEE!
	<br><br>
	Eventually Matthew got his coffee, but only had 4 minutes to make it to the station (you know the drill by now). So he ran. And ran. And ran. He ran through the 
	pouring rain, hood swept back by the wind, side-stepping puddles and dashing across any road in his way. He could barely see thanks to the torrential rain, and 
	the sloshing of the coffee in the cup meant that plenty of coffee was escaping the cup and instead burning his hand. As he ran up High Street, completely out of 
	breath, he fumbled in one hand with his mask, and the other with the burning cup of coffee as he approached the station. Matthew made it inside, juggled the cup 
	about whilst trying to find the right ticket, made it through the barrier and just about made it onto the train in time, with a hand in pain, and as drenched as 
	a rat. Kind of normal at this point.
	<br><br>
	Nevertheless, Matthew sat down on the train to tell James that the train was leaving Swansea, only to find that James was in fact on the wrong bus entirely. Ha. 
	Ha. Ha. Very funny. All that running for nowt. When the train reached Gowerton, Matthew was standing by the door, fully expecting James not to have arrived, but 
	thanks to a stroke of luck, James was in fact there despite his negative 1-minute connection, and NT could continue!
	<br><br>
	This was yet another journey to Carmarthen. Again. Thanks to TfW changing their timetables, such that few to no services travel past Carmarthen, yet another 
	adventure was to be punctuated by another spell in Carmarthen. For the third time in a row. This was so ridiculous at this point that we calculated at we would 
	have spent more time in Carmarthen at the end of R<sub>0</sub>=5 than any other single destination over the course of the R<sub>0</sub> adventures so far. 
	Matthew made sure that his grievances against the town were well-known, and vowed not to head west on an adventure again, until he would no longer have to 
	wait at Carmarthen.
	<br><br>
	Carmarthen station was now extremely familiar to us by this point, as was the bridge to the town centre, and the town centre itself. So we decided to mix things 
	up this morning, and instead headed to Lidl to buy some healthy fruit, because these adventures are healthy and not at all dangerous or unsafe. We crossed the 
	bridge, walked along the pavement for a few dozen yards, crossed the road, and walked up the road to Lidl, where we bought some fruit (nectarines) for later. 
	<br><br>
	We then wandered through some back alleyways into the very familiar town centre, aimlessly walked around for a little bit and then made our way slowly back down 
	to the station yet again, to wait for our train to turn up. We took pictures of the ATW train with a rainbow decal, and crossed back and forth between the 
	platforms, unsure as to where our train would turn up and depart from. We must have looked so suspicious to the army of police officers standing around the 
	station! 
	<br><br>

	<br><br>
	Platform Dai! Go Go Go!
</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Platform Dai.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	We made it onto our train on Platform Dai with plenty of time to spare for once, which was a TfW sprinter (partially, but not completely refurbished, and 
	refurbished in a questionable manner to say the least) with half the doors taped off. We took our seats and settled in for the very short journey to Tenby.
	<br><br>
	As we approached the seaside town, the weather took a turn for the worse. Hmm. This wasn't looking good. We disembarked at the station and waved our train 
	off, as it followed our route from 2 adventures ago, towards Pembroke. The rain was coming down fairly hard already, as we walked out of the station and up 
	the street towards Premier Inn and the seaside - ah, it was good to be by the sea!
	<br><br>
	We walked all the way along the length of the seafront, battling the strong winds, horizontal rain and James's newfound nemesis: slippery slopes. We passed 
	the bench where we had spent the majority of Beta 2, and rounded our way across to the headland, passing all the pastel-coloured houses on the way. We 
	climbed up the headland, weaving our way in and out of the various defensive fortifications of Tenby Castle (of which a much greater percentage was open 
	than had been in Pembroke Castle), before climbing to the very top and standing at the top of the outcrop, admiring the mizzle (and resulting lack of 
	people). We walked around the defensive tower, coastguard house, the statue and the multitude of cannons, all in the pouring rain. We then descended to a 
	lower path encircling the hill, saw the bandstand, and then descended the stairs down to the beach.
	<br><br>
	Matthew doesn't like the beach. The sand is coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.
	<br><br>
	James, on the other hand, could finally channel his inner Cornishman - he lived for the sea! He loves the sand, he loves surfing on the sea, he loves being 
	unable to swim, and all his school trips had been to the seaside, to admire rockpools. Which is exactly what we did. We wandered over to some rocky outcrops, 
	near the rocky island at the edge of the beach, and essentially queued behind another family, waiting to walk through the tunnel, carved by the sea, through 
	the underside of the island. We managed to get quite high up the rocks whilst waiting. Eventually though, it was our turn to hop across the rocks punctuating 
	the water-filled tunnel, and make it through to the other side of the beach.
	<br><br>
	On the other side, we saw some seagulls tearing about chunks of crab, and many pieces of crab littering the sand. Lovely stuff. We also saw a multitude of 
	smaller caves pock-marking the cliff face of the rocky island, which we duly went to explore:
</p>

	<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </center>

<p>
	Once Caliban had finished in the early caves, we went to explore a much deeper one, with access to the sea on the other side. This one had dozens of pools 
	of water at the bottom, and we made our way to the back of the cave with varying degrees of success, and with only a few failures that resulted in getting 
	very wet. This cave too had been attacked by seagulls, and there were many chunks of crab here as well. Luckily though, we eventually found 1 small alive 
	crab, whom we decided to christen "Dave".
</p>

	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Dave.jpg" width="30%"></center>

<p>
	We then left the large cave, and slowly made our way down the beach, back towards the town. Along the way, however, we came across even more interesting 
	rocky outcrops, some of which concealed caves, not unlike Caliban's first caves, or indeed James's fireplace in Pembroke Castle:

<p>
	Do I really need to comment here?
	<br><br>
	We finally left the rocky island, and, jumping across the sandy rivulets, we made our way back to the town. Matthew grudgingly admitted that the beach wasn't 
	<i>too</i> bad. We eventually made our way to a staircase hewn into the rock face itself, and made our way back up to the pastel-coloured houses that lined the 
	seafront, but not before we had taken the time to film this beauty:
</p>
	
	<center><video width="40%" controls><source src="./resources/video/Seagull.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>

<p>
	We then spent the next while wandering around the town centre, with the eventual goal of finding lunch. Oh, and also avoiding as many crowds as possible. The 
	weather was not as shit as it had been when we arrived, and so the crowds of people were beginning to assault the town. Hence, we spent a decent while trying 
	to walk down plenty of backstreets, to try and avoid as many people as possible. It was also at this point that James revealed that he had met his future 
	Mandarin teacher at Exeter, and had opened his interview by criticising her for asking "Ni hao ma", as real Chinese people never, ever ask this!
	<br><br>
	We now started to look up places to eat, and walked over to quite a number of them, but found none of them suitable. Some of them were in fact far more classy 
	and expensive than they had looked on line, some were full, some were closed and some were just too damn chocked. Eventually, we ended up just outside the town 
	wall, trying to get signal to look for a place to eat (which was surprisingly hard to get), and eventually settled on the fantastically-named "Oh My Cod" 
	fish and chips. We walked over there, ordered, recieved our orders and walked down to the beach once more. We turned left at the beach, to head up towards a bit 
	of the North Beach that neither of us had been to before, found a staircase leading down to some benches, passed what smelled like Tenby's crack central, and 
	found a dry-ish bench about halfway down the slope to the beach. Matthew opened up his box of fish and chips, only to watch the fork fly out of the box, into 
	the air, and onto the floor... fingers it was then!
	<br><br>
	We sat eating our fish and chips as the rain picked up once more. Eating fish and chips with one's fingers was turning out to be rather difficult, unfortunately 
	for Matthew. It was made no easier by a group of seagulls flying above us, encircling us.

<p>
	We had a long and <s>amusing</s> painful conversation about the wonders of Caerau - how the residents live at the top of a mountain, surrounded by barbed wire - not to keep 
	others out, but to keep the 'citizens' of Cearau in. Caerau has no police force, as one of the 'citizens' favourite pasttimes is to steal all the tyres off the police car 
	then set it alight, when the police car stops at a red light. This was just home for James! We eventually finished up our fish and chips, climbed back up to the seafront 
	path, and headed back into the town, hoping for a spot of tea, and hoping that some of the crowds had disappated.
	<br><br>
	The crowds seemed to have mostly lightened, but unfortunately, they had all made their way into the various cafes and shops in the town... including our favourite 
	tea shop, which we had visited during Beta 2. Hmm, this would require a new plan. We instead decided to make our way onto the other part of the seafront, by Castle 
	Beach and Tenby's South Beach. Once there, we just kept walking. And walking. And walked until we found somewhere more interesting, where we could kill time. At the 
	time, this walk seemed like ages, and it seemed as if we had completely left the town behind, almost as if we were halfway to Penally (the next village along the 
	coast, and the next train station). However, now that we are writing this up, it turns out that we were but a few yards out of town, at the entrance to Tenby's 
	South Beach. Nevertheless, that degree of walking had tired James out, and he fancied something additional to eat. We went to the South Beach Bar and Grill, took 
	note of the Covid protocols, and headed in for some tea and something to eat.
	<br><br>
	We were shown to our table by a very friendly waitress and sat down. We each ordered a pot of tea, and James was recommended the Brains beer brownies by the waitress. 
	Never one to pass up any alcohol, James immediately decided that this was what he wanted, and ordered one.
	<br><br>
	Shortly after, our tea arrived, and it was very nice and refreshing to have some. We ought to have tea more often on our adventures, especially given the quantity 
	that we both usually drink. Fortunately for James though, he'd very soon get the chance to have something to "drink", as his beer brownie had arrived. And it was 
	<i>enormous!</i>. It was more the size of a large pizza than the kind of brownie he had been expecting, and boy must it have contained plenty of beer! He enjoyed it 
	greatly, but was convinced by the end that his eyes were bigger than his stomach. We paid, and set off, back to the train, having now abandoned our initial plan 
	to walk to Penally station - our train was almost here!
	<br><br>
	We walked briskly back through various residential streets at the back of Tenby, none of which we had ever seen before, in a hope to beat the train to the station. 
	(No matter how late Matthew actually is, he is always terrified of missing connections... possibly because he is usually always late, and misses most of his 
	connections). Meanwhile, navigating the maze of streets was beginning to be a bit much for James. The beer brownie was beginning to kick in. <strong>"I think those 
	beer brownies were slightly ethanolic!"</strong>. 
	<br><br>
	Eventually though, we made our way back to the station, had our photo, and awaited our train. To our enormous surprise, the train that had come to see us was Jezza 
	yet again! Jezza seemed to want to be on <i>every</i> NT adventure! What a glorious <s>stolen</s> train!
</p>

	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Tenby.jpg" width="55%"></center>

<p>
	The journey home was mostly uneventful, with the exception of the stopover at Carmarthen making Matthew very irritated indeed that he had to visit that cursed 
	town again. We considered paying a visit to the Tea shop once more, but we didn't want to have a flying visit for 5 minutes, as we didn't have long, and wouldn't 
	be able to actually buy anything. There was the minor amusement of an altercation at the station, where two fare-dodging youths were removed from the train at the 
	last minute, and given a stern talking-to by the covid officers. Whilst this was going on, the train departed, leaving the youths behind, as we made our way back home.

	It's Trago time! Join us on a quest through the shittiest bits of Merthyr Tydfil to the holy grail of discount shops - Trago! Featuring Tesco Station, TfW's 
	antisymmetric new HQ and Plan E. 0/10 would not recommend.
	<br><br>
	At last! Mrs Arthur <s>had not</s> removed her ban on James heading east, but we did it anyway, as Matthew was now completely fed up of the countryside - it was time to 
	head back to the valleys, and Matthew had just the valley in mind... Merthyr Tydfil! Indeed, thanks to the timings of non-rush hour trains in and out of Cardiff, 
	Matthew had come up with an excellent plan that involved spending HOURS in the town. But this was great, because Merthyr was clearly shit enough to keep us 
	entertained for many hours, right?
	<br><br>
	James boarded a fairly packed morning train to Cardiff, having just made it on time, no thanks to the rubbish busses. James boarded the train before 9am, and Matthew 
	joined at Neath just afterwards, and we were off, on yet another trip to the valleys! The trip down to Cardiff was very enjoyable - we hadn't done this route in 
	absolutely ages. We arrived in Cardiff and soon after were back on the train, this time uppa Valleys!
	<br><br>
	We passed many of our favourite Sampi locations - Radyr, where a pacer and a sprinter had raced from different platforms, NANTGARW, Pontypridd, where we had waited 
	previously in the pouring rain for a connection (and also where the comically long station looms over the town), and a load of shitty valley towns, which actually 
	looked much less shit, now that the sun was shining and the bunting was out. In fact, the journey up was very pleasant, now that the sides of the valley were bright 
	and illuminated by the sun, not shrouded in mist with darkness approaching and the rain bucketing down.
	<br><br>
	On our way up to Tesco station, a family joined the train. This shouldn't have been a problem. However, they showed blatant disregard for all social distancing rules. 
	The children decided to run up and down the train like headless morons, ripping off the social-distancing tape, and then eating it. The mother didn't care. She had her 
	nose 5 miles into her phone, reading the Daily Star and sniffing crack cocaine off the screen.
	<br><br>
	Eventually, we pulled into our favourite station of all time: Merthyr Tydfil Tesco station. How fucking glorious! Never before, or since, have we come across any 
	station that equals the station straight out of heaven. How we thank the Gods of Arriva for placing this station here. Amen.
	<br><br>
	Just like on Sampi 1, we decided to head into Tesco, except this time, we actually went inside with the intention to buy something. By now, this wasn't even surprising. 
	Of course we were meandering through Merthyr Tydfil Tesco, browsing the medicine aisle. This was a completely normal situation to be in, on a nutty train adventure, in 
	the middle of a pandemic. :)
	<br><br>
	Matthew bought himself some Vaseline, and James bought some Pizza Express-flavoured crisps. How interesting. We paid, and exited Tesco - it was time to enter Merthyr... 
	when we could work out how to navigate the shopping centre behind Tesco. Eventually, we made our way out, and began our trek through the town centre, up towards Trago. 
	We made our way up the high street, passing the smorgasbord of shops that Merthyr Tydfil is famous for having in its vibrant town centre, including Greggs, and many 
	pubs (some of which were still offering Eat Out to Help Out, but we thought we'd be pushing our luck if we went to a pub in Merthyr - we'd quite like to make it home 
	in a non-powdered form). We turned past the <i>enormous</i> bus station, which seemed comically large compared to the train station, and also of a really peculiar 
	(and self-evidently covid-safe) design. It seemed to be a tubular design - various small stations of one or two bays each, connected by long glass and plastic tubes, 
	to form a ring of smaller bus stations. It was very odd. We then ran across the busy road, and made our way up the path by the side of the river, heading for our 
	first destination of the day: <a href="https://upsetvictorians.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-true-origin-of-china-nickname-for.html">Chinatown</a>!
	<br><br>
	It is worth noting at this point that Merthyr's "Chinatown", as it was called at the time, was not really a Chinatown in the traditional sense. More specifically, 
	there were no Chinese buildings, restaurants or people in Chinatown. It was just called Chinatown because they felt like it. Chinatown had been at the very heart of 
	Victorian Merthyr's slums, occupying only a very small area, yet cramming hundreds of people, pubs, brothels and drug dens into an incredibly dense zone. It even had 
	its own "Emperor", complete with a tea warehouse and a religious nutcase preacher! This was everything we ever wanted from NT! Moreover, it appeared to have a 
	Chinese takeaway. This was perfect! Ad Chinatown!
	<br><br>
	Alas, we were left heartbroken. "Chinatown" was now merely a single road of respectable-looking terraced houses, with shiny council offices behind them, and no 
	evidence at all of their glorious history. Even the takeaway appeared to in fact be Indian, or Thai, not Chinese. Not even James's story about being sick in a 
	bush could lift the mood. This was devastating. Unfortunately, there were more disappointments to come later.
	<br><br>
	We made our way through some dodgy council estate (which had very strange-looking houses - one seemed to have a clock tower or something), after crossing the river, 
	and then started climbing quite hard. We walked over to a huge junction, and after getting briefly confused, we embarked upon our quest... along the side of a dual 
	carriageway. This really was true Merthyr style. There was a very narrow pavement that snaked its way alongside the road, but the narrow grassy verge separating us 
	from the loud, busy and fast stream of traffic was not enough to reassure us. Simply put: we were terrified that we could be run over at literally any moment. This 
	was slightly too intense even for NT. To break the mood, we brought out the crisps, which were surprisingly very nice.
	<br><br>
	Eventually we reached the top, and came upon our next major obstacle - a huge roundabout. This was the pinch point of the trip, which Matthew had been unable to 
	solve by looking at a map. It would be pure guesswork as to whether we would actually be able to cross, and how we would then cross the A470 just up ahead. We 
	paced back and forth, investigating the area, looking for any way across the impenetrable obstacle, that neither involved running across the roundabout, sprinting 
	across the near-motorway, or walking along the hard shoulder. Unfortunately, this seemed a rather impossible set of initial conditions. This was devastating, as the 
	towers of Trago were now in sight, and were just on the other side of the A470. We couldn't give up now! After an aborted attempt to cross the roundabouts in one 
	direction, we instead took the footbridge across the road, to travel around the roundabout in the other direction. At last, we had defeated the first obstacle! 
	Following this, we followed a footpath down alongside B&Q, and then underneath the A470, and into a small residential street perched alongside it, thereby giving us 
	a way across the near-motorway without getting blasted into pieces by the oncoming traffic. Huzzah!
	<br><br>
	We walked up past the few houses, which were quite obviously in a very rural area before Trago had arrived (and later became a chock hotspot in March 2021), and 
	continued to climb the barren mountain that overlooked Merthyr and separated it from Aberdare. The mountains in the valleys are very odd near the heads of the valleys. 
	They lose most vegetation and become barren moorland and scrubland, with the only signs of life being some hardy yellow grasses, some heather and some bracken. It is 
	almost like stepping straight into the Scottish Highlands. 
	<br><br>
	We eventually got to the looming razor wire gates, guarding the entrance road to Trago, crossed over, and entered the threshold - here we were - we had done it! We walked 
	along the road for a little while, then ran down a steep dusty path down to the service car park, and slowly rounded the exterior of the massive building.
	<br><br>
	Yet despite being near his favourite shop in the world, things were already starting to seem off to James. A sprawling car park? A collection of disjointed outbuildings 
	and warehouses? A soft play centre? Restaurants on the outside? No real windows in the towers? Worst of all, no cafe at the top of the watchtower? This was beginning 
	to appear suspiciously like a <i>*spits*</i> DEVON Trago!
	<br><br>
	James was temporarily calmed by the reappearance of a familiar face - one of the shops lining the entrance to Trago was a Warrens Bakery, and they do the best Cornish 
	pasties of them all! We each had a Cornish Pasty for lunch. This was Matthew's first proper Cornish pasty, and he will admit that it was in fact very noice. After 
	fending off a lone seagull (this truly was like Kernow), we headed inside... 
	<br><br>
	<strong>THIS ISN'T PROPER TRAGO!</strong>
	<br><br>
	James was right. This wasn't proper Trago. This was heresy. Normal Trago, in God's Country, is actually made up of a sequence of individual rooms, each housing a 
	different department selling unique things. You must pass through the rooms in a certain order, as they all lead into one another, despite there being no logic to 
	the order in which the rooms appear - for example, the restaurant is just in one of the rooms at random, and you have to pass through it to continue shopping. 
	But this had none of that. It was just an enormous warehouse, selling discounted crap, with no rooms to speak of! It was just like any other bargain basement ever! 
	No departments, no rooms, and no restaurant inside - that was outside, in a separate section. How could they have defiled his Trago like this? NOOOOOOOO!
	<br><br>
	We did have a wander through the fake Trago though. We started in the garden section, then moved onto more DIY stuff. We then entered into some upholstery and furniture, 
	where we saw this amazing, amazing bed unit:
</p>

<center><img src="./resources/photos/Corona.jpg" width="55%"></center>

<p>
	But not even Chock could improve this. Nor could the collection of random books (including one by Colin Beveridge), the completely outdated tech section, or even 
	the random sofas sitting in the middle of the one-way system. The carpet section was abominable, so bad that at this point, James even admitted that Merthyr 
	Trago was worse than Trago in devil country! The straw that broke the camel's back was the fact that they had replaced the Kernow trinket collection with Welsh 
	souvenirs. This was simply too much to handle. We had to get out of here! We queued for what seemed like eternity, paid, and got out of there as quickly as possible. 
	<br><br>
	This, however, caused a problem. We had bargained that Trago would be so amazing that we would spend hours there. Instead, it had been so disappointing, that despite 
	our best efforts to go as slowly as possible, we had barely wasted an hour. Moreover, there was fuck all else to do in Merthyr. We were fed up of the town that had 
	proven to be such a disappointment, and decided that we wanted to leave as soon as possible.
	<br><br>
	So we did. We climbed back up to the gates, descended the mountain once more, crossed through the tunnel, and re-emerged at the roundabout. We considered visiting 
	M&S to wash the scent of fake Trago off ourselves, but instead crossed the footbridge and headed back down the dual carriageway, back through the council estate, back 
	past Chinatown, along the river, and past the bus station. Before we knew it, we were back in Merthyr town centre, and in strong need of tea. So that is what we did. 
	We headed into the very 60s brutalist shopping centre, located Costa, pretended to fill in the track-and-trace form, ordered our large teas, and sat down to enjoy 
	them. It is really saying something when the most enjoyable part of what should have been a fantastically nuts adventure in the crowning glory of shit valley towns turns 
	out to be a cup of tea in Costa.
	<br><br>
	Halfway through drinking, we left Costa to make our way to the station, as a conveniently-timed train was about to arrive. Matthew downed his remaining tea whilst 
	standing on the platform, and James finished his after the train had started moving. Good riddance to Merthyr Tydfil!
	<br><br>
	We were rather fed up and disappointed by now. Merthyr had meant to signal a return to the halycon glory days of nuttiness - the Sampi adventures. Yet instead, it 
	had been a complete and utter wet fish. We decided to turn to Twitter for solace. We were fresh out of Twitter jail, so what better way to celebrate this precarious 
	situation by firing off a load of controversial tweets?

	It was still only the early afternoon, and we were in need of something else to occupy our time. As the train rounded its way along the side of Pontypridd, Matthew 
	saw something intriguing. For a brief second, he had caught a glimpse of a large and imposing building, bearing "WALES" in large letters along the side. Could it be 
	the fabled brand-new TfW headquarters? Matthew was certain that it must be! So when the train pulled into the station, Matthew pulled James off, and decided to 
	investigate!
	<br><br>
	Eventually we managed to work out how to exit the strange one-way system of the station, which had confused us before, and was already weird enough before Covid. We 
	did however work out how to make our way to ground level, and stood at the side of the main road, eager to embark upon our quest of discovery! We made our way along 
	the main road, towards the river, and crossed over into the town centre, hoping to catch a better glimpse of the building to confirm or deny Matthew's theory... 
	or indeed just help us know where we were going, as Matthew was just striding off in what he thought was the correct general direction, with absolutely no knowledge 
	of the town centre, and no clear idea as to where he was even headed. We continued along the main road, past rows of familiar terraced Valley houses, all whilst 
	James attempted to glean some idea of what on earth was going through Matthew's mind.
	<br><br>
	James: So where exactly are you dragging me?<br>
	Matthew: To the TfW HQ! I caught a brief glimpse of it in this direction from the train! Come on!<br>
	James: Are you sure?<br>
	Matthew: Yes! I saw a big building with "Wales" written on the side! It has to be it!<br>
	James: Matthew! This is Wales! Lots of buildings have "Wales" written on the side! How can you be sure it was the TfW HQ? You can't just assume every building with 
	"Wales" on the side is the TfW HQ!<br>
	Matthew: Yes I can! Clearly every building with "Wales" on in fact has "Transport for..." before it. "Wales" implies "Transport for". <br>
	James: No Matthew! I'll grant you, that round here, "Transport for" implies "Wales", but not the other way around! What has Kevin been teaching you?<br>
	Matthew: I am standing my ground! That is the TfW HQ! "Transport for" implies "Wales", and "Wales" implies "Transport for"! They are one and the same! x implies y, 
	y implies x!<br>
	*rounds corner, at which point the TfW HQ finally comes into view* <br>
	Matthew: See, I told you, it is <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antisymmetric">antisymmetric</a> - x=y!
	<br><br>
	Sure enough, it was the TfW HQ, and we made our way down to the construction site. This truly was a monument to a fantastic train operator - a veritable Mecca for 
	those who are interested in trains! Knowing that a photo here would become a valuable possession once this HQ was rightfully acknowledged as an icon of train history, 
	we had a picture, before we'd have to compete with the hoards of tourists that are one day bound to visit this beautiful landmark:
</p>

	<center><img src="./resources/photos/TfW.jpg" width="55%"></center>

<p>
	Jokes aside, it was a very nice building. Matthew had once been paid to write an article about the constuction of this and the neighbouring offices, as well as the 
	new library down the street. All three were easily the nicest things in the town. We crossed the bridge to the park on the opposite bank of the river, crossed back, 
	attempted to steal a chair from the middle of the street (only to find it was firmly anchored down), and decided to make our way back to the station.
	<br><br>
	We walked this time through the town centre, passing many charity shops and poundshops. We then went off the beaten track, and found a dodgy-looking entrance to 
	Pontypridd Market, which turned out to be surprisingly nice. There was even a nice-looking Chinese restaurant, which James entered, in order to speak to the owner 
	and practice his Chinese.
	<br><br>
	We eventually emerged back at the main street, crossed over to the station, and made our way up onto the extremely long platform, which we decided to walk all the 
	way to the end of, in order to kill time. For some strange reason, Pontypridd has the longest station platforms in Wales, which gives the actually rather busy station 
	a permanent feeling of disuse and neglect. We reached the end of the platform, turned around... and saw our train approaching the other end. Fuck. We abandoned all 
	thoughts of being Covid-safe and legged it to the other end. This is pretty much a <i>running</i> theme by now. Fortunately, all this practice meant that we beat the 
	train to the platform, and had just enough time to snap this (very hasty) picture before boarding:
</p>

	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Pontypridd.jpg" width="55%"></center>

<p>
	Seeing that Chinese restaurant in Pontypridd market had made James crave Chinese food, so we spent much of the journey past Nantgarw searching for a suitable 
	restaurant in Cardiff. Before long, James had found an excellent-looking one in Llandaf, and decided to see if they were open.
	<br><br>
	When we reached Radyr, James was deeply disappointed that in what may be his final TfW adventure before the end of 2020 (the then-deadline for removing all 
	remaining pacers), he had not yet been on a pacer. So when we pulled into the station and found a pacer waiting on the other platform, we jumped at the chance! 
	We disembarked, crossed over the bridge and boarded the pacer on the other platform. Ah, pacers. How we will miss the jolting, screaming rides that we have 
	all grown to love. On the way back to Cardiff Central, we passed the Canton sheds, and admired the motley collection of trains, of all different types, of 
	all different liveries, and of all different states of decay, that TfW had stolen from operators from around the country. It was a trainspotter's paradise - 
	all the UK's trains were gathered in one place. Trainspotters! Come to Cardiff! There is plenty to see, except for us, as we will be elsewhere!
	<br><br>
	We pulled into Cardiff Central, bid our pacer adieu, and walked into the city centre, looking for a Chinese takeaway. We walked around the city centre in a 
	number of loops, before settling on a certain takeaway, and making our way towards Queen Street. It looked promising to James on the outside, having no 
	English text whatsoever, but it turned out that it was in fact closed. Time for Plan B.
	<br><br>
	We started to walk up in the direction of Llandaf/Cathays, as the restaurant James had looked up earlier was in fact having renovation work done, and were closed. 
	So instead he rang up another Chinese takeaway, who this time were actually open. He booked a table on the phone, and we started walking to the restaurant. We eventually 
	arrived at the restaurant. The front of the restaurant had fallen onto the pavement, in pieces. It was a shithole. It looked like you'd get much worse than food 
	poisoning here. So we abandoned this plan. Time for Plan C.
	<br><br>
	Not really knowing what else to do, we continued walking towards Cathays, hoping that the number of uni students there would guarantee a Chinese takeaway. We crossed 
	the road encircling the city centre, and walked past the National Museum, and past Cathays train station. We crossed the shitty, slippery cast iron bridge at the 
	station, and then continued up, past the Maths department, to a crossroads, where we turned right into a studenty area, filled with Asian food shops and takeaways.
	<br><br>
	We passed a nice looking Chinese takeaway along the way, and decided that this would be our Plan C. As it was not yet open, we continued up to another crossroads, 
	and there found a Domino's Pizza, which seemed like a suitable backup Plan D. However, both of us preferred the idea of Chinese, so we abandoned Plan D and returned 
	to Plan C.
	<br><br>
	We stood outside the takeaway for about 20 minutes, admiring the collection of books in the ex-phonebox, now mini-library, watching the students walk by, and 
	reading the menu. We were now very hungry. After opening time had been and gone, the owner's son walked out, and said that they were in fact closed. Damn! We'd 
	have to find a Plan E, and we were starving!
	<br><br>
	Fortunately, Plan E was not far away. There was a Japanese restaurant on the opposite side of the street, Yukiyan. Even though James wanted Chinese, this was 
	good enough for him, as he was starving. We went inside, and sat down. It was very nice in there - very calm and relaxing. We both ordered green tea, some 
	sushi starters, and a noodle main, all of which were delicious (much better than the Wagamama we had visited on Koppa 2). This definitely had been worth all the 
	setbacks. When we were done, we paid, and James crossed the street to a Chinese bakery, where he had a long conversation with the owners, and came out with a 
	taro dessert. Not bad for Plan E.
	<br><br>
	We made our way back to the city centre, and entered the St Davids shopping centre, whilst killing a few minutes waiting for our train home. It was here that 
	Matthew introduced James to Borat, and his anti-Jew songs, which James found hilarious. VEY NICE! James would later spend that evening watching Borat, and learning 
	all the words to "Throw the Jew down the well!". 
</p>

	<center><iframe frameborder="0" height="360px" width="640px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4hlwDSnkXrA" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>

<p>
	We boarded our train home (a Class 800), and would usually settle in for a rest on the way home. But instead, James showed Matthew the joys of Penryn Fitfinder, 
	the Facebook page where Penryn art students quite literally search for fresh meat to have one-night stands with. This was clearly intolerable to both of us, so 
	we decided that it was time to break out BooleanBot, and fact-check all these horrific posts. The logic behind BooleanBot is simple - BooleanBot answers "True" 
	if the post is true, according to the principles of logic, and "False" if otherwise. Needless to say, BooleanBot has made the already-popular James even more 
	popular on Penryn Fitfinder.
	<br><br>
	Eventually, Matthew disembarked at Neath to head home, whilst James continued to Swansea, boarded a bus that travelled through Mayhill, and finally arrived 
	home to spend his evening watching Borat. Great Success!

	STEEEEEAM TRAAAAAIN! We finally did it - we went on to Lydney and caught the Dean Forest Railway, and caught a steam train up and down the line! Along the way, 
	James had a terrible morning, and Matthew unexpectedly met Freya in Cardiff.
	<br><br>
	*Disclaimer: a lot of time has passed since this adventure, so this account may be patchier than the ones you are used to. Let's dive in!
	<br><br>
	What a way to close out the R<sub>0</sub>s! With Matthew imminently heading back to London, we calculated that we had time for perhaps one more R<sub>0</sub> 
	before the summer was over. Whilst we had wanted to spend that Saturday on a trip to Pilning (we will come back for you at some point, Pilning!), a different 
	opportunity presented itself - a trip on a heritage railway! Duly, we booked tickets to ride on a real steam train on the Dean Forest Railway, and tick off 
	something that neither of us had done for years and years. The Dean Forest Railway (DFR) actually connects to the mainline at Lydney, and in non-chocky times you 
	can hop straight off the train and get on the steam train up the branch line. Unfortunately however, and as you have probably guessed by this point, all the 
	R<sub>0</sub> adventures <i>were</i> in chock times, so our journey on this adventure would involve a long, brisk and potentially complicated/dangerous walk 
	all the way to the DFR depot at Norchard to check in there. Add to this TfW fucking us over with a 2-hourly service, and you arrive at our stupid and complicated 
	journey plan for this adventure. Nevertheless, all that it required was for all the preceding transport links to work perfectly! What could go wrong?

	Ha. Ha. Ha. Plenty.
	<br><br>
	<i>Welcome everyone to the 'How to derail an NT adventure' conference. I will be your host today, Dai the Drive. Today, we will be running through our plan to completely 
	fuck James over and prevent him from catching his train. No need to worry about Matthew - he takes care of himself by being late to everything, all the time. Let's 
	get started then!</i>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Step 1: I, Dai the Drive, shall completely fuck James over right from the start. I shall drive the 111 to Swansea, and ensure that I am not only late, 
		ill-tempered and drunk, but that at every single stop from James' house to Swansea, I shall get off and have a fag. After this, I will take only the 
		busiest roads to slow the bus down to below walking pace, so that James does a Matthew and decides it would be quicker to run up the hill instead of stay 
		on the bus.
	</li>
    <li>Step 2: Then you, the other Dai the Drive, will be driving the "faster" bus that James attempts to catch after he gets fed up of mine. You must ensure 
		that you are half an hour late, and show up smoking cwâc. Between the 2 of us, we will delay James so much that he not only misses his train, but misses 
		the next one and has to leg it to the one after.
	</li>
    <li>Step 3: And this is where you, Dave the train manager come in. You must ensure that the 0923 that James has absolutely killed himself to catch must then 
		completely shit itself and break down as it attempts to leave. Your train has to completely collapse. This will cause James to tear his hair out. If you can 
		make the train catch fire and take out some chavs/half of Swansea at the same time, then that is an added bonus.
	</li>
    <li>Step 4: And finally, Dai the station announcer, just to top it all off, when James gets on his replacement train, announce it as a "Great Western Trains" 
		service, to make James think he has lost his mind. Reality is an illusion, the universe is a hologram, buy toilet roll!
	</li>
  </ul>

<p>
	Nonetheless, after this plan had been executed to perfection, some rejigging of our plans (again) meant that we could still make it to Lydney on time, and 
	just about catch the steam train. James' 800 accelerated like Matthew going to a morning lecture, and soon enough Matthew was picked up at Neath (who had for 
	once in his life been early - what are the odds?), and we were on our way!

	Before too long at all, we had arrived in Cardiff and now had plenty of time to kill before TfW's magical mystery train turned up on its 2 hour schedule, 
	now that TfW had cancelled every single really useful engine ever (apart from Jezza and the pacers - RIP). For this reason, we headed out into Cardiff to kill 
	some time.
	<br><br>
	It was not very long at all before we happened to bump into Freya's mum, to Matthew's utter horror. Having put great effort into trying to convince Freya's mum that 
	he was not a trainspotter, and that NT did not do stuff like this, the one and only time we ran into her, we were doing exactly that. Fuck my life.
	<br><br>
	We then waited around with Freya's mum and waited for Freya's family to assemble at their nominated meeting point, one-by-one, by the statue of Aneurin Bevan on 
	Queen Street. Everyone turned up at the correct time... except Freya. Freya was lost. Again.
	<br><br>
	She eventually found her way to the meeting point, using Pokemon Go, and was enormously surprised to discover Matthew there in Cardiff, completely unannounced. We all 
	walked back towards Cardiff Central, as Freya and her family were now heading home, whilst Matthew despaired about how lost Freya was going to get in London in just a 
	few weeks time (miraculously though, this never happened, and Freya is now better at navigating in London than she is in Wales).
	<br><br>
	After this surprise meeting, we split up, killed a little more time in Cardiff city centre, before heading to the train station ourselves, for just gone 12. Here, we 
	spotted a HST (#DefinitelyAHST - Tick!), avoided a train photographer (oh the irony), and then got on our train to Lydney, passing a random steam train express on the 
	way out of the station - how weird!

	Before long at all, we had passed the Nazi town hall in Newport and had arrived in Lydney - a fairly quiet station in the middle of what seemed like nowhere, deep 
	in the greenery to the south of the town itself. Nonetheless, we had a limited amount of time to get to the DFR at Norchard, so we set off in a hurry, walking along 
	the roads until we peeled off down a footpath towards the town playing fields.
	<br><br>
	Lydney had a really nice English countryside feel to it. It was a really pleasant little town, complete with village green, village lake, and a lovely village 
	high street. We walked alongside the lake, before turning off over a twee little bridge, passed the playing fields as a game of cricket was in progress, and saw 
	the steam train pass through the middle of the village high street on our way through. It was so nice that James said he would have happily lived there, were 
	it not norrrth o' thar Tamar, ooh arrgh!
	<br><br>
	After this we headed up a quiet residential street, passing an old apple tree and a line of houses just in front of the railway line, before we and the road then 
	disappeared into the forest, all the way to Norchard. This really, really was not a journey meant to be done by foot - perhaps James' suggestion of a taxi wasn't 
	a bad idea after all! However, before long, we had arrived in the station car park, and with 20 minutes to spare as well! Lovely Jubbly!
	<br><br>
	We checked in at the station entrance, and then joined the queue for the train itself at Norchard Low Level station. The whole set up there was really very lovely - 
	the old station infrastructure had all been restored, all the staff were in classic uniforms, vintage signs absolutely littered the place, there were old codgers 
	working on the even older engines in the sidings, and to top it all off, the station master sang an amusing social distancing song whilst we queued on the platform! 
	You really couldn't ask for any more!
	<br><br>
	Eventually we were shown to our seats on the carriage, and we sat down and took our masks off, and waited for the train to depart.
	<br><br>
	The train shortly set off, puffing into life, and chuffed its way down the line, blowing clouds of white smoke into the summer sky and we twisted our way through 
	the green countryside, passing this sheep:
</p>

	<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </center>

<p>
	(Disclaimer: sheep not included)
	<br><br>
	Unfortunately, because of Covid, this train was not able to stop at every station on the line, so we were unable to tick them all off on the way. Fortunately though, 
	this gives us an excuse to go back one day! Optime!
	<br><br>
	Nevertheless, we did slow down at every station, and were able to see all the lucky bastards who lived in the old station masters' cottages at each halt, and were 
	out in their gardens, waving at the train as it went past.
	<br><br>
	Eventually we arrived at Parkend, the final stop on the line (for now - they do have a line extension programme underway though). We were all allowed to disembark to 
	watch the engine decouple from the front of the train, rewater, reverse down the other line, and couple up with the other end of the train. We took this chance to get 
	our station sign photo, explore the carriages and old station building, and head up to the bridge in order to watch the locomotive complete all of its procedures and 
	recouple to the other end of the train, ready for the return journey. It was a really nice experience at Parkend.
	<br><br>
	We then zipped down the entire line, straight through Norchard, and into Lydney town centre itself. Once again, in non-chock times, it is possible to just hop onto the 
	train from the town centre itself, which will be a fun way to enjoy the beautiful town centre itself, when we inevitably go back to the DFR on a future Sampi. 
	<br><br>
	As we passed through Lydney, all along the train's route, children and adults alike stopped to wave at the train as it went past, and nowhere was this more true than 
	when we passed through the town centre and through Lydney Town ¬station. It all felt extremely wholesome - very unusual for an NT adventure in progress!
	<br><br>
	We left the town centre, headed back into the greenery for a mile and a bit, and before long had arrived at the other end of the line - Lydney Junction, just around 
	the corner from the mainline station. Here, the train stopped for everyone to admire it, before once again switching ends like it had done at Parkend.
	<br><br>
	At this station, everyone from the entire train disembarked and we spent our time photographing and filming the old-timey carriages from the inside, including long 
	corridor shots and shots from inside the little compartments. It was very similar to the Hogwarts Express in Harry Potter, on the inside.
	<br><br>
	We also disembarked to get shots of the station, the engine moving to the front of the train, and even had our photo <i>taken by someone else</i> in front of the 
	station sign - what a luxury!
	<br><br>
	We then got back on the train and headed back to Norchard, once again waving back at all the children and grandparents who were waving at us on the train as we passed.

	Once back at Norchard, we disembarked, left a donation after a lovely day out, and headed to the Low Level station building/cafe to buy a cup of tea and have a sit 
	down. Whilst it was no cream tea, it was good enough. After a brief wander around the station museum and gift shop, we then headed back to the town centre and the 
	mainline to catch a train back to Cardiff.
	<br><br>
	We reached the town centre after a much more leisurely return walk, reminiscing about what a fantastic day out it had been (and that is rare on an NT adventure - 
	by this point we are usually standing in the pissing rain in some Godforsaken hellhole, with a starving and angry James) when the next steam train approached us 
	from behind just as we crossed the High Street. Just as others had waved at us, we waved at the train as it passed, and all seemed right with the world - 
	<strong>'God I can't wait to be old!'</strong>
	<br><br>
	We followed the walking trail alongside the railway, ticking off 2 ¬stations on foot along the way - the lovely Lydney Town, and the abandoned St Mary's Halt, which 
	we explored for a prolonged period of time, going up and down the footbridge between the disused platforms, waving at the train once more at it returned past us to 
	Norchard. Finally, we walked all the way to the mainline station, just around the corner from Lydney Junction, and waited for our (surprise, surprise) delayed TfW 
	train to Cardiff. Round of applause, TfW. Round of fucking applause.
	<br><br>
	Once back in Cardiff, we headed to our perennial favourite, Pizza Express, as there was simply no alternative to end such a great adventure, and a great summer of 
	adventures, despite First Cymru's best efforts to derail this adventure, and chock's best efforts to derail NT entirely.
	<br><br>
	Continuing our tour of Cardiff's Pizza Expresses, we headed to the restaurant just off the very busy St Mary St, which was absolutely rammed with drunken pubgoers, 
	enough to scare James half to death. Once inside though, it was very quiet, and we were free to work out how on earth to order using the app in peace. We both ended 
	up celebrating this classic adventure with classic pizzas - Matthew had his new favourite Pollo Ad Astra, and James had his classic superhot rectangular Calabrese - 
	'because quadrilaterals > circles'. 
	<br><br>
	We had our pizzas, paid, headed back to the station, and headed home. With the minor blip of James then being offered cwâc outside Swansea station on his way home, 
	it had been a fantastic adventure and a great end to the R<sub>0</sub> adventures!
