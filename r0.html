<p>       IT'S CHOCKY TIME!!!  </p>
<p> Thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, we were unable to go on any adventures following Koppa 2 in Jan/Feb 2020 (the first case in the UK was recorded during that 
adventure). However, by the end of July, James was brave enough to attempt using public transport, and quickly dragged Matthew along. Here is a once-in-a-lifetime 
snapshot of our nuts experiences of public transport during a socially distanced world! Illi Vitae! </p>

<div class="content">
<p>Back to basics in the lockdown - wandering through Neath for miles in the rain, and eating too much ice cream
	<br><br>
It was a fairly surreal morning when Matthew walked down to Neath train station. Wearing his original mask (which was bright orange, had vents and was too tight on 
his nose), he was finally going to meet James again, for the 1st time since Koppa 2 in Jan/Feb! Moreover, James had been down in Cornwall until earlier that week, 
so getting to see him, let alone going on an adventure, was a huge surprise in the so far almost completely uneventful pandemic. However, 4 months in, things were 
slowly easing open, and the resumption of NT was a huge step towards normality for James and Matthew.
	<br><br>
James had fled Cornwall with his family, fearing an explosion of emmets invading the county (true to his word, the plague of locusts descended only 1-2 weeks later). 
Unlike Matthew, James had already been on a train and survived, so James was perfectly happy to take a bus and a train to Neath, where he met Matthew whilst exiting 
the station. And it was in this manner that the nuttiness was resumed...
	<br><br>
We wandered around Neath, with our masks on (although James criticised Matthew's mask with vents) before quickly abandoning the charade and heading to Morrisons to 
buy some lunch and some crisps each. Matthew bought his classic miserly bread rolls, and we also bought the ubiquitous salt and vinegar crisps. We then set off; 
intrepid explorers in the glorious urban jungle of Neath! 
	<br><br>
Our first plan of attack was to head towards Skewen, so we crossed the canal, the river, the other canal and the train tracks (admiring the old Neath Low Level/Neath 
Riverside station which is visible from the bridge) before setting off past the Roman ruins, Dwr-y-Felin and Tesco. We continued up the main road past Neath Abbey 
and began climbing for approximately a mile, all the way up through Skewen, to <a href="http://www.crescicafe.co.uk/">Cresci's</a> ice cream, where we went in and 
ordered. 
	<br><br>
Matthew ordered a large cone with a flake, and stood aside to let James order:<br>
James: Can I have a large tub please?<br>
James paid his £5 (which seemed like a sensible price to the Cornishman) and lady serving us then pulled out a massive tub. 'Don't worry,' thought James, 'she'll 
only put a few scoops in there'. But she didn't. She kept adding more, and more, and more, until the entire 1 litre tub was filled to the brim with ice cream. 
James looked utterly gobsmacked as he took the gargantuan pot and walked out, to the sound of Matthew laughing at him.
	<br><br>
Matthew: Why did you order the large tub, James?<br>
James: I didn't think it would be <i>this</i> big! <strong>In Cornwall, a large tub is 3 scoops!</strong>
	<br><br>
We walked down the street to Skewen Park, and found a dry bench, as far from the screaming children in the playground as possible, and then ate their ice cream. Or 
in James's case, attempted to eat his ice cream. It almost proved too much for him, and he gave up at one point, but he came back strong and was able to finish it. 
He had narrowly avoided Matthew bullying him for having eyes bigger than his stomach for the rest of the adventure. We walked back up through the park, James put 
his empty family-sized tub into the <s>rusting oil-drum</s> bin, and we walked back towards Cresci's.
	<br><br>
Just behind Cresci's is Skewen station, which thanks to the pandemic, was receiving almost no stopping services. However, seeing as we had arrived without using 
any public transport... Tick! Another ¬station for our ¬station list! We wandered up and down the 2 platforms, admiring the 2 dot matrices (barely working) as 
they claimed that the station had no services until 10pm. Great work TfW! This disagreed with RTT, which claimed there would be a service in just over an hour, but 
this was too long to spend in Skewen, and Matthew wasn't quite ready to put the Trains back into Nutty Trains yet. So we kept walking.
	<br><br>
After another section of walking, we arrived at Neath Abbey, which possibly due to the fact that Cadw seem not to care about it, was open, despite the looming 
Covid pandemic. We headed inside, passing the building contractors <s>¬</s>working. Neath Abbey was actually quite nice that day, and it was a nice treat for 
Matthew to visit for the first time in about a decade. We wandered through the ruined rooms, almost got stuck in a garderobe, and then headed out to the destroyed 
cloisters. James shouted some loud profanity just as we passed some small children. How lovely.
	<br><br>
We spent much of our remaining time trying to fathom whether the massive chunks of fallen rock had fallen naturally or had been pulled down by the denizens of Neath. 
This was Neath, so the answer was obviously the latter. We also pressed the Welsh language button on all the available information points, and explored the final 
few rooms before returning to Neath. We returned by walking up the Tennant Canal, past the scaffolding on the Abbey, past the floodplain and the dual carriageway, 
under the flyover bridge and alongside the river, before arriving in Neath, having admired the shitty, polluted, stagnant water in the canal all the way. Mmmm, tasty. 
	<br><br>
After a quick second trip to Morrisons to get Matthew some water, we sat in the newly-reopened Victoria Gardens, in the shade, and ate our lunch, despite James 
having eaten 1 litre of ice cream a mere hour ago. We then deliberated our next course of action, before setting off towards the other canal. We passed the site of 
the old Neath Canalside station (although Matthew did not know this at the time), and walked the 2.5 mile length of the canal, along the cycle trail from Neath 
to Briton Ferry. We passed the back of the Milland Road Industrial Estate and the disused Metal Box Factory, as well as seeing various dilapadated factories and 
outlet pipes pouring into the river. Such glorious sights had never been seen before. Truly, this was a magnificent trip. We also saw some horses, a few cows and a 
heron, but Londoners like Matthew care very little for wildlife, so he ignored all that nonsense.
	<br><br>
Along the way, James revealed that his course was being discontinued, to his great disappointment. Now he would have no freshers to torment! He also revealed that as 
hardly any of his coursemates actually had A Levels, and as even fewer were actual mathematicians, he was now de facto head of MathSoc and was now responsible for 
producing some award videos for the MathSoc awards the following week (stay tuned for R<sub>0</sub>=2 everyone!). Matthew meanwhile complained about his estrangement 
from the beautiful, wonderful MLC :(.
	<br><br>
With about a mile to go, where the canal and river almost converge, it began to rain somewhat. We picked up the pace as we approached the town. Fortunately, James 
knew where he was after Matthew explained: 'Neath basically bifurcates into Briton Ferry and Skewen'. We reached the end of the canal section and began to climb 
steeply. Despite James wheezing at the top, we made it... and went all the way back down to the railway station. ¬Station 2... Tick!
	<br><br>
There were a similar lack of stopping services in our direction (an 800 came our way and almost blew us off the platform though), but the other platform had an 
unscheduled 175 stop to pick up the 1 passenger waiting in the shelter. By this point it was raining hard, so we waited in the freezing cold shelter, filled with 
the relaxing aromas of second-hand smoke, weed and crack. Mmm, welcome to Briton Ferry.
	<br><br>
We sat talking in the shelter for about half an hour, when we decided that enough was enough and that we had to return to Neath, no matter whether it was raining or 
not. James pleaded with Matthew to take a bus, but Matthew was adamant - no buses! Therefore, poor James had to stagger the 3 miles home, as Matthew led the way 
past the glorious sights of Briton Ferry and the Melin (the latter to James's horror - his mum had warned him about the Melin!).
	<br><br>
We headed to the Gnoll's 1st pond for a sit down, to rest James's exhausted legs, and have some crisps, as tradition dictates. We avoided the groups of chavvy youths 
as they passed us, and had a nice rest before walking back to the station at some speed, so that James could catch his train and not be forced to spend yet another 
hour walking around Neath, grinding his legs to stumps. We made it back just in time, so that James could pass through the ticket barrier and make it back before 
his mum had a fit about the chock. Matthew meanwhile, was reassured by James's account of the train that he could safely take the train next time. Nutty Trains would 
be back!</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">R<sub>0</sub>=2: "That's awful! Awful is my word for amazing!"</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Get ready for a mask-wearing, socially-distanced foray to Cardiff, with video filming in IKEA thrown in! (Essential workers only, this is a pandemic, of course)
	<br><br>
This time Matthew was ready to step on a train for the first time since late March, and so it was time for Nutty <i>Trains</i> to hit the rails once more! James 
boarded the train in Swansea just before 10 o'clock, and then Matthew joined him at Neath at 10:06, armed with his double mask and complete lack of sanity. The train 
was only a sprinter, but the carriage was fairly empty nonetheless. This particular class of sprinter is armed with a very large array of Kafkaesque announcements, 
designed to instill the fear of God into the unsuspecting passenger. These included Welsh Government announcements, warnings about protecting the vulnerable from 
Covid, congratulatory praise for NHS and essential workers, and frequent reminders that the trains were for essential workers only - NO NON-ESSENTIAL TRAVEL. Oops.
	<br><br>
We decided to keep fairly quiet as the train made its way down through Port Talbot and Bridgend, as we took in the familiar sights on the route to Cardiff. To 
Matthew, NT really feels like it comes alive when we head east, as that is the way the valleys lie, and countless nutty trips have been made there in summers and 
other holidays in the past. As the draconian threats of death to all non-essential travellers continued unabated, we entered the city and pulled into the station - 
we had arrived at last!
	<br><br>
We disembarked from the train and were shoved around the socially-distanced station's new one-way system, until we finally found a staircase to take us into the 
station's underground concourse and out through the ticket barriers into the city centre. James was distraught that the station's M&S was shut, but we carried on, 
past the new BBC HQ and a person whom James absolutely didn't act <REDACTED> towards, walked through the middle of a busy road, and joined Cardiff's shopping centre. 
We passed through one of the arcades which Matthew picked at random, but by sheer luck it happened to be the right choice, as the first stop of the day was located in 
that very arcade - <a href="https://www.penandpaper.co.uk/">Pen & Paper</a>.
	<br><br>
We entered the little shop, and started to wander around, albeit getting thoroughly confused by the one-way system that was in place (we were only reassured when one 
of the employees, with a very thick Kaahdiff accent, was clearly ignoring the system). James was immediately enticed by the fountain pen display, as he was looking 
for a second model, and the shop had a selection of small brands whom he'd never heard of before, and he was very impressed. Matthew meanwhile headed over to the 
pencils section to get Freya something for her birthday. Matthew bought a few coloured pencils, some very soft black pencils and a charcoal stick for her, and even 
managed to get a loyalty card at the shop, at long last. James meanwhile settled on a Abbey Autograph pen, which he was very pleased at both the quality and 
the value for money.
	<br><br>
We then decided to head for Queen Street. James led the way up towards Cardiff Market and Cardiff Castle... which was wrong. Matthew then led the way... somewhere... 
and got slightly lost. This was also wrong. Matthew then finally remembered the correct route, past Primark, WHSmith and the Capital Shopping Centre, all the way to 
Sainsbury's, where we went in and bought ourselves lunch and crisps for later.
	<br><br>
James couldn't quite wait for lunchtime, so immediately brought out his drink of choice - a blue Innocent smoothie. Why had he chosen it? Well, it was blue! He gave 
it a sip, and uttered the immortal line,<br>
<strong>Mmm, that's... that's awful!<br>
Awful is my word for amazing!</strong>
	<br><br>
No matter how amazing the smoothie, he had to put it away when we reached Grangetown station, as we had to fumble for our tickets and put our masks on. The station 
guard gave James a hard time for attempting to cross the ticket line without a mask (despite them only having been compulsory for 48 hours), but we eventually made 
it up to the platform and got on our train to our next destination - Grangetown.
	<br><br>
It had obviously been a long time since Matthew had been on a train, especially a train in Cardiff, as he seemed genuinely perplexed when the train curved its way 
around the city centre and started approaching Cardiff Central. Had we just evaded the fares/tricked the ticket barriers? It certainly seemed we had! This was enough 
to send Matthew into a fit of laughter, as we had not only managed to evade fares and trick the ticket barriers on a day when we weren't even yet allowed on public 
transport to begin with, but we had managed to do so through sheer incompetance! Welcome to Nutty Trains, they say. Reckless, ill-planned and now illegal adventures, 
coming soon during a pandemic near you!
	<br><br>
The trip down to Grangetown was mostly uneventful, but when we arrived at the station, we had reached our de facto terminus for the day. We all know the rules by now, 
and we were hardly going to pass up an opportunity for a mask photo. Nwotegen: Tick!
</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Grangetown.jpg" width="70%"></center>
<p> We left the station and headed down the stairs, to the alleyway connecting the Ikea car park with the station, passing the dodgy car mechanics on the way. We felt 
great about ourselves - this was just like old times! Walking through dodgy places in the middle of nowhere, with no real idea where we were headed... except this 
time it was in Chocky times!
	<br><br>
We crossed through the Ikea car park, only to find that all of our usual (1) entrances were blocked off by barriers in order to form a socially distanced queue. Damn 
staff, always pandering to cars! Don't they ever spare a thought for the nutters who walk to Ikea? Nevertheless, we wandered our way around until we found an 
entrance, slipped our way in and headed in the direction of the queue. We had to cross a few barriers to get to the end of the queue itself. Of course, we failed 
miserably at this. Matthew decided to go under the barrier... right as James was stepping over it, thereby managing to hoist the chains straight into James's crotch...
	<br><br>
We queued for the best part of 45 minutes, killing time standing in the car park. During this time, James revealed his true intentions for the continuation of our 
#IKEAmeansIKEA trip, and hoisted a camera stand set out of his bag. James, as de facto head of MathSoc (and the only real mathematician there), had been selected to 
film some of the award videos for their annual awards ceremony that Friday. Kind of. He had been given the envelopes with the names of the shortlists and winners, and 
had been told to leave the sealed until Friday, when he would reveal the lucky winner via a Zoom call. Except, this being James, he was going to do nothing of the 
sort. Using his poor internet as an excuse, he decided he would instead film himself reading out the award shortlists and winners beforehand, and send the videos to 
the organiser of the ceremony... at the last minute, so that she wouldn't know the twist...
	<br><br>
1 video was to be filmed in IKEA!
	<br><br>
We eventually made it into the shop, ascended the escalator, and spent a few minutes searching for a trolley to place the camera equipment on. We climbed to the top 
floor, went back down in the lift, found a trolley on the 1st floor, went back up in the lift, realised that we had left the lift on the wrong side of the one-way 
system, went back down in the lift, went around to the other side of the lift and went back up to the top floor one last time. Finally, we had made it. We continued 
down the path towards the displays, and immediately found a comfy, homely-looking sofa. This was a perfect filming location! Here, we would film the awards video! 
We spent ages setting the camera stand up on the front of the trolley, adjusting the angle so that he could be captured both sitting down in his 'living room' (which 
had a suspiciously large number of IKEA price tags attached), as well as walking down the aisle, when he would reveal to MathSoc that <s>he actually lives in IKEA</s> 
it wasn't actually his living room, and that he was in IKEA. Unfortunately, this was harder than it seemed. Every time a staff member walked past, we would hide the 
camera to make us seem less suspicious, and every few seconds more people would arrive, <i>actually shopping for stuff</i>. Disgraceful. When we finally managed to 
get the entire clip on film without being interupted, his head was almost cut off the top of the film, the audio quality was terrible, and the entire thing was rushed 
out of fear. James criticised Matthew for having no standards of decency, and Matthew laughed like a maniacal IPN. Nevertheless, a Plan B would have to be sought. 
	<br><br>
Despite this being James's video, Matthew saw an opportunity to be nuts, and so rejected his sensible idea to film the video outside IKEA, or in the IKEA car park. 
No, this video was to be filmed in the showroom, or we weren't worthy of the title IPN! We found a nice little desk tucked away in the office section of the showroom, 
towards the back corner of the building. This was perfect! James sat down at the table whilst Matthew maneuvered the filming trolley into position. Lights, Camera, 
Action!
	<br><br>
"Hello MathSoc, I am here to announce some of the 2020 Annual MathSoc Awards, and I'm definitely not filming this in IKEA!"<br>
<i>(Lifts up conveniently placed IKEA mug in front of him, with price tag still attached)</i>
	<br><br>
With our primary mission accomplished (including the guest appearance of the tannoy and a baby screaming at the end), we headed downstairs with our still empty 
trolley to fulfil our secondary mission - buying some useless random crap. Matthew spotted a dish mat, and decided this was a suitable start, even though it wasn't 
particularly crap, as he might actually use it. James countered with a light-up house, made from luminous yellow plastic. This was undeniably random and crap. We 
headed through the towering aisles of flatpack furniture, before arriving at our favourite section of the entire store - the bargain section! Here, Matthew bought a 
discounted IKEA cookbook, despite being completely unable to cook any meals more complex than absolute basics, and James bought some <s>metal snowflake coasters</s>, 
shurikens, meaning he won this round. We queued up, paid for our items, avoided the queue for the bistro and walked out, pleased with our veritable haul of shit. 
	<br><br>
We then wandered up though Grangetown to a park, eventually found our way in through the seemingly sole gate, and sat down as far away from the screaming children 
and <REDACTED> family playing cricket as possible. We ate our lunch, spotted a few trains on the nearby viaduct and admired our collection of shit, whilst also 
discussing Matthew's family's recent 'Healthweek' initiative, whereby they were meant to become more healthy by improving their diets and doing more exercise... 
without going out and doing any exercise, reducing portion sizes or cutting back on the chocolate and desserts everyday. James was rather gobsmacked by the portion 
sizes and lack of greens that Matthew spoke of.
	<br><br>
We then finished our lunch and walked back to Grangetown station, rather exhausted by our first train adventure in almost 6 months. Despite it being only 
mid-afternoon, we returned to Cardiff Central and then caught the train home, ready for a longer train adventure to unexplored regions next time!
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">R<sub>0</sub>=3: "I like sniffing things, okay?"</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Getting tipsy in a pub next to a castle in the pouring rain? This seems like perfectly normal behaviour!</p>
<p>After our escapade to Cardiff, "the big city", according to Mrs Arthur, James was now banned from any further adventures to the east for the time being, and this 
included Swansea. Therefore, from now on, our R0 adventures would have to be West Wales adventures, to James's delight. This meant Matthew would have to catch an 
earlier train than James, which would be... interesting, given Matthew's known perfect punctuality.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, Matthew actually arrived at the station just about on time (despite setting off late), collected his tickets from the machine, passed through the ticket 
barrier and sprinted over the bridge and onto the other platform, making it onto the train with about 10 seconds to spare. He then sat on the train until it reached 
Swansea, reading his book (by Michael Collins). 
<br><br>
The train pulled into Swansea, where Matthew stretched his legs, wandering up and down the island platform. Here, he spotted the fabled SWR TfW train - a sprinter 
which TfW nicked from SWR, kept the livery and stuck a TfW logo on the side. Fantasteg. The train was definitely not stolen. Absolutely not. We would later nickname 
this train "Jezza", and Jezza managed to appear in a great number of our adventures after this. Sadly, today we were unable to travel on Jezza, but fortunately the 
Milford Haven train (which we were taking to Carmarthen) had a number of interesting passengers, including 2 Chinese tourists and a "fat bloke who fills half the 
carriage" - Matthew, 2K2X.
<br><br>
James, meanwhile was rushing to try and make his very tight connection from his bus to Gowerton station, and there was such a high chance he wouldn't make it that 
Matthew was prepared to leave the train. Luckily, when the train pulled into the platform, James was waiting there, and the nuttiness could begin!
<br><br>
Heading west for the first time in 11 months was exciting for both James and Matthew, especially considering that our only trip west had been Sampi 6, in which we 
rattled through all 3 branch lines in a single outing. For the first time, we could actually choose the destinations we wanted to explore, rather than be stuck in 
the shitty termini. Before long, the train was pulling into Carmarthen, where, thanks to chock, we would have to wait for our connection, as only Milford Haven trains 
passed through the town without terminating. Annoyingly, we would discover that there always seemed to be a 1 hour time delay between the Milford Haven trains and 
the Pembroke Dock trains, meaning plenty of waiting about.
<br><br>
We headed into the town, across the bridge, through the bus station, and into the town centre. We had a wander around for a bit, before heading into M&S for some 
crisps, as our tradition dictates. Matthew bought the classic Salt and Vinegar, and James tried out Sweet Chili. James paid, to get the discounted price for the 2 
bags, but was disdainful of Matthew's attempts to pay him back in "chockbits" (coins). After getting slightly lost behind the shop, we then went to Coffee#1 and had 
tea and coffee to wake ourselves up. Matthew had the special Ceylon (which had bergamot in and was floral) and James had a coffee. We then headed leisurely back to 
the station, as we still had time to kill.
<br><br>
Carmarthen station was guarded by 2 security people, whom we'd encounter every time we left the station over the summer. During this adventure though, they were far 
more concerned about compliance with covid regulations than they were with people actually paying their fares. MASKS ON! We dithered between the platforms, switching 
back and forth, whilst also laughing at the shitty rolling stock that was pulling into the station. We crossed over to the other platform and boarded our train at the 
one entrance (out of 4) which hadn't been taped off. Mmm. Social distancey. 
<br><br>
The train pulled off towards Tenby, and we were on our way! Admittedly, we spent most of the journey on the way down sharing memes, as we'd already been through 
this section of the line, and thanks to chock, we couldn't jump on and off even if we wanted to. Cue plenty of Mao and Xi memes, mangoes and sparrows from James, 
which Matthew countered with Australian Star Wars election posters. All of them, however, pale in comparison to this, which Matthew pulled out as his ace:
