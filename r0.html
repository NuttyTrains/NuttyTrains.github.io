<p>       IT'S CHOCKY TIME!!!  </p>
<p> Thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, we were unable to go on any adventures following Koppa 2 in Jan/Feb 2020 (the first case in the UK was recorded during that 
adventure). However, by the end of July, James was brave enough to attempt using public transport, and quickly dragged Matthew along. Here is a once-in-a-lifetime 
snapshot of our nuts experiences of public transport during a socially distanced world! Illi Vitae! </p>

<p>Back to basics in the lockdown - wandering through Neath for miles in the rain, and eating too much ice cream
	<br><br>
It was a fairly surreal morning when Matthew walked down to Neath train station. Wearing his original mask (which was bright orange, had vents and was too tight on 
his nose), he was finally going to meet James again, for the 1st time since Koppa 2 in Jan/Feb! Moreover, James had been down in Cornwall until earlier that week, 
so getting to see him, let alone going on an adventure, was a huge surprise in the so far almost completely uneventful pandemic. However, 4 months in, things were 
slowly easing open, and the resumption of NT was a huge step towards normality for James and Matthew.
	<br><br>
James had fled Cornwall with his family, fearing an explosion of emmets invading the county (true to his word, the plague of locusts descended only 1-2 weeks later). 
Unlike Matthew, James had already been on a train and survived, so James was perfectly happy to take a bus and a train to Neath, where he met Matthew whilst exiting 
the station. And it was in this manner that the nuttiness was resumed...
	<br><br>
We wandered around Neath, with our masks on (although James criticised Matthew's mask with vents) before quickly abandoning the charade and heading to Morrisons to 
buy some lunch and some crisps each. Matthew bought his classic miserly bread rolls, and we also bought the ubiquitous salt and vinegar crisps. We then set off; 
intrepid explorers in the glorious urban jungle of Neath! 
	<br><br>
Our first plan of attack was to head towards Skewen, so we crossed the canal, the river, the other canal and the train tracks (admiring the old Neath Low Level/Neath 
Riverside station which is visible from the bridge) before setting off past the Roman ruins, Dwr-y-Felin and Tesco. We continued up the main road past Neath Abbey 
and began climbing for approximately a mile, all the way up through Skewen, to <a href="http://www.crescicafe.co.uk/">Cresci's</a> ice cream, where we went in and 
ordered. 
	<br><br>
Matthew ordered a large cone with a flake, and stood aside to let James order:<br>
James: Can I have a large tub please?<br>
James paid his £5 (which seemed like a sensible price to the Cornishman) and lady serving us then pulled out a massive tub. 'Don't worry,' thought James, 'she'll 
only put a few scoops in there'. But she didn't. She kept adding more, and more, and more, until the entire 1 litre tub was filled to the brim with ice cream. 
James looked utterly gobsmacked as he took the gargantuan pot and walked out, to the sound of Matthew laughing at him.
	<br><br>
Matthew: Why did you order the large tub, James?<br>
James: I didn't think it would be <i>this</i> big! <strong>In Cornwall, a large tub is 3 scoops!</strong>
	<br><br>
We walked down the street to Skewen Park, and found a dry bench, as far from the screaming children in the playground as possible, and then ate their ice cream. Or 
in James's case, attempted to eat his ice cream. It almost proved too much for him, and he gave up at one point, but he came back strong and was able to finish it. 
He had narrowly avoided Matthew bullying him for having eyes bigger than his stomach for the rest of the adventure. We walked back up through the park, James put 
his empty family-sized tub into the <s>rusting oil-drum</s> bin, and we walked back towards Cresci's.
	<br><br>
Just behind Cresci's is Skewen station, which thanks to the pandemic, was receiving almost no stopping services. However, seeing as we had arrived without using 
any public transport... Tick! Another ¬station for our ¬station list! We wandered up and down the 2 platforms, admiring the 2 dot matrices (barely working) as 
they claimed that the station had no services until 10pm. Great work TfW! This disagreed with RTT, which claimed there would be a service in just over an hour, but 
this was too long to spend in Skewen, and Matthew wasn't quite ready to put the Trains back into Nutty Trains yet. So we kept walking.
	<br><br>
After another section of walking, we arrived at Neath Abbey, which possibly due to the fact that Cadw seem not to care about it, was open, despite the looming 
Covid pandemic. We headed inside, passing the building contractors <s>¬</s>working. Neath Abbey was actually quite nice that day, and it was a nice treat for 
Matthew to visit for the first time in about a decade. We wandered through the ruined rooms, almost got stuck in a garderobe, and then headed out to the destroyed 
cloisters. James shouted some loud profanity just as we passed some small children. How lovely.
	<br><br>
We spent much of our remaining time trying to fathom whether the massive chunks of fallen rock had fallen naturally or had been pulled down by the denizens of Neath. 
This was Neath, so the answer was obviously the latter. We also pressed the Welsh language button on all the available information points, and explored the final 
few rooms before returning to Neath. We returned by walking up the Tennant Canal, past the scaffolding on the Abbey, past the floodplain and the dual carriageway, 
under the flyover bridge and alongside the river, before arriving in Neath, having admired the shitty, polluted, stagnant water in the canal all the way. Mmmm, tasty. 
	<br><br>
After a quick second trip to Morrisons to get Matthew some water, we sat in the newly-reopened Victoria Gardens, in the shade, and ate our lunch, despite James 
having eaten 1 litre of ice cream a mere hour ago. We then deliberated our next course of action, before setting off towards the other canal. We passed the site of 
the old Neath Canalside station (although Matthew did not know this at the time), and walked the 2.5 mile length of the canal, along the cycle trail from Neath 
to Briton Ferry. We passed the back of the Milland Road Industrial Estate and the disused Metal Box Factory, as well as seeing various dilapadated factories and 
outlet pipes pouring into the river. Such glorious sights had never been seen before. Truly, this was a magnificent trip. We also saw some horses, a few cows and a 
heron, but Londoners like Matthew care very little for wildlife, so he ignored all that nonsense.
	<br><br>
Along the way, James revealed that his course was being discontinued, to his great disappointment. Now he would have no freshers to torment! He also revealed that as 
hardly any of his coursemates actually had A Levels, and as even fewer were actual mathematicians, he was now de facto head of MathSoc and was now responsible for 
producing some award videos for the MathSoc awards the following week (stay tuned for R<sub>0</sub>=2 everyone!). Matthew meanwhile complained about his estrangement 
from the beautiful, wonderful MLC :(.
	<br><br>
With about a mile to go, where the canal and river almost converge, it began to rain somewhat. We picked up the pace as we approached the town. Fortunately, James 
knew where he was after Matthew explained: 'Neath basically bifurcates into Briton Ferry and Skewen'. We reached the end of the canal section and began to climb 
steeply. Despite James wheezing at the top, we made it... and went all the way back down to the railway station. ¬Station 2... Tick!
	<br><br>
There were a similar lack of stopping services in our direction (an 800 came our way and almost blew us off the platform though), but the other platform had an 
unscheduled 175 stop to pick up the 1 passenger waiting in the shelter. By this point it was raining hard, so we waited in the freezing cold shelter, filled with 
the relaxing aromas of second-hand smoke, weed and crack. Mmm, welcome to Briton Ferry.
	<br><br>
We sat talking in the shelter for about half an hour, when we decided that enough was enough and that we had to return to Neath, no matter whether it was raining or 
not. James pleaded with Matthew to take a bus, but Matthew was adamant - no buses! Therefore, poor James had to stagger the 3 miles home, as Matthew led the way 
past the glorious sights of Briton Ferry and the Melin (the latter to James's horror - his mum had warned him about the Melin!).
	<br><br>
We headed to the Gnoll's 1st pond for a sit down, to rest James's exhausted legs, and have some crisps, as tradition dictates. We avoided the groups of chavvy youths 
as they passed us, and had a nice rest before walking back to the station at some speed, so that James could catch his train and not be forced to spend yet another 
hour walking around Neath, grinding his legs to stumps. We made it back just in time, so that James could pass through the ticket barrier and make it back before 
his mum had a fit about the chock. Matthew meanwhile, was reassured by James's account of the train that he could safely take the train next time. Nutty Trains would 
be back!</p>
