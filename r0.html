<p>       IT'S CHOCKY TIME!!!  </p>
<p> Thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, we were unable to go on any adventures following Koppa 2 in Jan/Feb 2020 (the first case in the UK was recorded during that 
adventure). However, by the end of July, James was brave enough to attempt using public transport, and quickly dragged Matthew along. Here is a once-in-a-lifetime 
snapshot of our nuts experiences of public transport during a socially distanced world! Illi Vitae! </p>

<div class="content">
<p>Back to basics in the lockdown - wandering through Neath for miles in the rain, and eating too much ice cream
	<br><br>
It was a fairly surreal morning when Matthew walked down to Neath train station. Wearing his original mask (which was bright orange, had vents and was too tight on 
his nose), he was finally going to meet James again, for the 1st time since Koppa 2 in Jan/Feb! Moreover, James had been down in Cornwall until earlier that week, 
so getting to see him, let alone going on an adventure, was a huge surprise in the so far almost completely uneventful pandemic. However, 4 months in, things were 
slowly easing open, and the resumption of NT was a huge step towards normality for James and Matthew.
	<br><br>
James had fled Cornwall with his family, fearing an explosion of emmets invading the county (true to his word, the plague of locusts descended only 1-2 weeks later). 
Unlike Matthew, James had already been on a train and survived, so James was perfectly happy to take a bus and a train to Neath, where he met Matthew whilst exiting 
the station. And it was in this manner that the nuttiness was resumed...
	<br><br>
We wandered around Neath, with our masks on (although James criticised Matthew's mask with vents) before quickly abandoning the charade and heading to Morrisons to 
buy some lunch and some crisps each. Matthew bought his classic miserly bread rolls, and we also bought the ubiquitous salt and vinegar crisps. We then set off; 
intrepid explorers in the glorious urban jungle of Neath! 
	<br><br>
Our first plan of attack was to head towards Skewen, so we crossed the canal, the river, the other canal and the train tracks (admiring the old Neath Low Level/Neath 
Riverside station which is visible from the bridge) before setting off past the Roman ruins, Dwr-y-Felin and Tesco. We continued up the main road past Neath Abbey 
and began climbing for approximately a mile, all the way up through Skewen, to <a href="http://www.crescicafe.co.uk/">Cresci's</a> ice cream, where we went in and 
ordered. 
	<br><br>
Matthew ordered a large cone with a flake, and stood aside to let James order:<br>
James: Can I have a large tub please?<br>
James paid his £5 (which seemed like a sensible price to the Cornishman) and lady serving us then pulled out a massive tub. 'Don't worry,' thought James, 'she'll 
only put a few scoops in there'. But she didn't. She kept adding more, and more, and more, until the entire 1 litre tub was filled to the brim with ice cream. 
James looked utterly gobsmacked as he took the gargantuan pot and walked out, to the sound of Matthew laughing at him.
	<br><br>
Matthew: Why did you order the large tub, James?<br>
James: I didn't think it would be <i>this</i> big! <strong>In Cornwall, a large tub is 3 scoops!</strong>
	<br><br>
We walked down the street to Skewen Park, and found a dry bench, as far from the screaming children in the playground as possible, and then ate their ice cream. Or 
in James's case, attempted to eat his ice cream. It almost proved too much for him, and he gave up at one point, but he came back strong and was able to finish it. 
He had narrowly avoided Matthew bullying him for having eyes bigger than his stomach for the rest of the adventure. We walked back up through the park, James put 
his empty family-sized tub into the <s>rusting oil-drum</s> bin, and we walked back towards Cresci's.
	<br><br>
Just behind Cresci's is Skewen station, which thanks to the pandemic, was receiving almost no stopping services. However, seeing as we had arrived without using 
any public transport... Tick! Another ¬station for our ¬station list! We wandered up and down the 2 platforms, admiring the 2 dot matrices (barely working) as 
they claimed that the station had no services until 10pm. Great work TfW! This disagreed with RTT, which claimed there would be a service in just over an hour, but 
this was too long to spend in Skewen, and Matthew wasn't quite ready to put the Trains back into Nutty Trains yet. So we kept walking.
	<br><br>
After another section of walking, we arrived at Neath Abbey, which possibly due to the fact that Cadw seem not to care about it, was open, despite the looming 
Covid pandemic. We headed inside, passing the building contractors <s>¬</s>working. Neath Abbey was actually quite nice that day, and it was a nice treat for 
Matthew to visit for the first time in about a decade. We wandered through the ruined rooms, almost got stuck in a garderobe, and then headed out to the destroyed 
cloisters. James shouted some loud profanity just as we passed some small children. How lovely.
	<br><br>
We spent much of our remaining time trying to fathom whether the massive chunks of fallen rock had fallen naturally or had been pulled down by the denizens of Neath. 
This was Neath, so the answer was obviously the latter. We also pressed the Welsh language button on all the available information points, and explored the final 
few rooms before returning to Neath. We returned by walking up the Tennant Canal, past the scaffolding on the Abbey, past the floodplain and the dual carriageway, 
under the flyover bridge and alongside the river, before arriving in Neath, having admired the shitty, polluted, stagnant water in the canal all the way. Mmmm, tasty. 
	<br><br>
After a quick second trip to Morrisons to get Matthew some water, we sat in the newly-reopened Victoria Gardens, in the shade, and ate our lunch, despite James 
having eaten 1 litre of ice cream a mere hour ago. We then deliberated our next course of action, before setting off towards the other canal. We passed the site of 
the old Neath Canalside station (although Matthew did not know this at the time), and walked the 2.5 mile length of the canal, along the cycle trail from Neath 
to Briton Ferry. We passed the back of the Milland Road Industrial Estate and the disused Metal Box Factory, as well as seeing various dilapadated factories and 
outlet pipes pouring into the river. Such glorious sights had never been seen before. Truly, this was a magnificent trip. We also saw some horses, a few cows and a 
heron, but Londoners like Matthew care very little for wildlife, so he ignored all that nonsense.
	<br><br>
Along the way, James revealed that his course was being discontinued, to his great disappointment. Now he would have no freshers to torment! He also revealed that as 
hardly any of his coursemates actually had A Levels, and as even fewer were actual mathematicians, he was now de facto head of MathSoc and was now responsible for 
producing some award videos for the MathSoc awards the following week (stay tuned for R<sub>0</sub>=2 everyone!). Matthew meanwhile complained about his estrangement 
from the beautiful, wonderful MLC :(.
	<br><br>
With about a mile to go, where the canal and river almost converge, it began to rain somewhat. We picked up the pace as we approached the town. Fortunately, James 
knew where he was after Matthew explained: 'Neath basically bifurcates into Briton Ferry and Skewen'. We reached the end of the canal section and began to climb 
steeply. Despite James wheezing at the top, we made it... and went all the way back down to the railway station. ¬Station 2... Tick!
	<br><br>
There were a similar lack of stopping services in our direction (an 800 came our way and almost blew us off the platform though), but the other platform had an 
unscheduled 175 stop to pick up the 1 passenger waiting in the shelter. By this point it was raining hard, so we waited in the freezing cold shelter, filled with 
the relaxing aromas of second-hand smoke, weed and crack. Mmm, welcome to Briton Ferry.
	<br><br>
We sat talking in the shelter for about half an hour, when we decided that enough was enough and that we had to return to Neath, no matter whether it was raining or 
not. James pleaded with Matthew to take a bus, but Matthew was adamant - no buses! Therefore, poor James had to stagger the 3 miles home, as Matthew led the way 
past the glorious sights of Briton Ferry and the Melin (the latter to James's horror - his mum had warned him about the Melin!).
	<br><br>
We headed to the Gnoll's 1st pond for a sit down, to rest James's exhausted legs, and have some crisps, as tradition dictates. We avoided the groups of chavvy youths 
as they passed us, and had a nice rest before walking back to the station at some speed, so that James could catch his train and not be forced to spend yet another 
hour walking around Neath, grinding his legs to stumps. We made it back just in time, so that James could pass through the ticket barrier and make it back before 
his mum had a fit about the chock. Matthew meanwhile, was reassured by James's account of the train that he could safely take the train next time. Nutty Trains would 
be back!</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">R<sub>0</sub>=2: "That's awful! Awful is my word for amazing!"</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Get ready for a mask-wearing, socially-distanced foray to Cardiff, with video filming in IKEA thrown in! (Essential workers only, this is a pandemic, of course)
	<br><br>
This time Matthew was ready to step on a train for the first time since late March, and so it was time for Nutty <i>Trains</i> to hit the rails once more! James 
boarded the train in Swansea just before 10 o'clock, and then Matthew joined him at Neath at 10:06, armed with his double mask and complete lack of sanity. The train 
was only a sprinter, but the carriage was fairly empty nonetheless. This particular class of sprinter is armed with a very large array of Kafkaesque announcements, 
designed to instill the fear of God into the unsuspecting passenger. These included Welsh Government announcements, warnings about protecting the vulnerable from 
Covid, congratulatory praise for NHS and essential workers, and frequent reminders that the trains were for essential workers only - NO NON-ESSENTIAL TRAVEL. Oops.
	<br><br>
We decided to keep fairly quiet as the train made its way down through Port Talbot and Bridgend, as we took in the familiar sights on the route to Cardiff. To 
Matthew, NT really feels like it comes alive when we head east, as that is the way the valleys lie, and countless nutty trips have been made there in summers and 
other holidays in the past. As the draconian threats of death to all non-essential travellers continued unabated, we entered the city and pulled into the station - 
we had arrived at last!
	<br><br>
We disembarked from the train and were shoved around the socially-distanced station's new one-way system, until we finally found a staircase to take us into the 
station's underground concourse and out through the ticket barriers into the city centre. James was distraught that the station's M&S was shut, but we carried on, 
past the new BBC HQ and a person whom James absolutely didn't act <REDACTED> towards, walked through the middle of a busy road, and joined Cardiff's shopping centre. 
We passed through one of the arcades which Matthew picked at random, but by sheer luck it happened to be the right choice, as the first stop of the day was located in 
that very arcade - <a href="https://www.penandpaper.co.uk/">Pen & Paper</a>.
	<br><br>
We entered the little shop, and started to wander around, albeit getting thoroughly confused by the one-way system that was in place (we were only reassured when one 
of the employees, with a very thick Kaahdiff accent, was clearly ignoring the system). James was immediately enticed by the fountain pen display, as he was looking 
for a second model, and the shop had a selection of small brands whom he'd never heard of before, and he was very impressed. Matthew meanwhile headed over to the 
pencils section to get Freya something for her birthday. Matthew bought a few coloured pencils, some very soft black pencils and a charcoal stick for her, and even 
managed to get a loyalty card at the shop, at long last. James meanwhile settled on a Abbey Autograph pen, which he was very pleased at both the quality and 
the value for money.
	<br><br>
We then decided to head for Queen Street. James led the way up towards Cardiff Market and Cardiff Castle... which was wrong. Matthew then led the way... somewhere... 
and got slightly lost. This was also wrong. Matthew then finally remembered the correct route, past Primark, WHSmith and the Capital Shopping Centre, all the way to 
Sainsbury's, where we went in and bought ourselves lunch and crisps for later.
	<br><br>
James couldn't quite wait for lunchtime, so immediately brought out his drink of choice - a blue Innocent smoothie. Why had he chosen it? Well, it was blue! He gave 
it a sip, and uttered the immortal line,<br>
<strong>Mmm, that's... that's awful!<br>
Awful is my word for amazing!</strong>
	<br><br>
No matter how amazing the smoothie, he had to put it away when we reached Grangetown station, as we had to fumble for our tickets and put our masks on. The station 
guard gave James a hard time for attempting to cross the ticket line without a mask (despite them only having been compulsory for 48 hours), but we eventually made 
it up to the platform and got on our train to our next destination - Grangetown.
	<br><br>
It had obviously been a long time since Matthew had been on a train, especially a train in Cardiff, as he seemed genuinely perplexed when the train curved its way 
around the city centre and started approaching Cardiff Central. Had we just evaded the fares/tricked the ticket barriers? It certainly seemed we had! This was enough 
to send Matthew into a fit of laughter, as we had not only managed to evade fares and trick the ticket barriers on a day when we weren't even yet allowed on public 
transport to begin with, but we had managed to do so through sheer incompetance! Welcome to Nutty Trains, they say. Reckless, ill-planned and now illegal adventures, 
coming soon during a pandemic near you!
	<br><br>
The trip down to Grangetown was mostly uneventful, but when we arrived at the station, we had reached our de facto terminus for the day. We all know the rules by now, 
and we were hardly going to pass up an opportunity for a mask photo. Nwotegen: Tick!
</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Grangetown.jpg" width="70%"></center>
<p> We left the station and headed down the stairs, to the alleyway connecting the Ikea car park with the station, passing the dodgy car mechanics on the way. We felt 
great about ourselves - this was just like old times! Walking through dodgy places in the middle of nowhere, with no real idea where we were headed... except this 
time it was in Chocky times!
	<br><br>
We crossed through the Ikea car park, only to find that all of our usual (1) entrances were blocked off by barriers in order to form a socially distanced queue. Damn 
staff, always pandering to cars! Don't they ever spare a thought for the nutters who walk to Ikea? Nevertheless, we wandered our way around until we found an 
entrance, slipped our way in and headed in the direction of the queue. We had to cross a few barriers to get to the end of the queue itself. Of course, we failed 
miserably at this. Matthew decided to go under the barrier... right as James was stepping over it, thereby managing to hoist the chains straight into James's crotch...
	<br><br>
We queued for the best part of 45 minutes, killing time standing in the car park. During this time, James revealed his true intentions for the continuation of our 
#IKEAmeansIKEA trip, and hoisted a camera stand set out of his bag. James, as de facto head of MathSoc (and the only real mathematician there), had been selected to 
film some of the award videos for their annual awards ceremony that Friday. Kind of. He had been given the envelopes with the names of the shortlists and winners, and 
had been told to leave the sealed until Friday, when he would reveal the lucky winner via a Zoom call. Except, this being James, he was going to do nothing of the 
sort. Using his poor internet as an excuse, he decided he would instead film himself reading out the award shortlists and winners beforehand, and send the videos to 
the organiser of the ceremony... at the last minute, so that she wouldn't know the twist...
	<br><br>
1 video was to be filmed in IKEA!
	<br><br>
We eventually made it into the shop, ascended the escalator, and spent a few minutes searching for a trolley to place the camera equipment on. We climbed to the top 
floor, went back down in the lift, found a trolley on the 1st floor, went back up in the lift, realised that we had left the lift on the wrong side of the one-way 
system, went back down in the lift, went around to the other side of the lift and went back up to the top floor one last time. Finally, we had made it. We continued 
down the path towards the displays, and immediately found a comfy, homely-looking sofa. This was a perfect filming location! Here, we would film the awards video! 
We spent ages setting the camera stand up on the front of the trolley, adjusting the angle so that he could be captured both sitting down in his 'living room' (which 
had a suspiciously large number of IKEA price tags attached), as well as walking down the aisle, when he would reveal to MathSoc that <s>he actually lives in IKEA</s> 
it wasn't actually his living room, and that he was in IKEA. Unfortunately, this was harder than it seemed. Every time a staff member walked past, we would hide the 
camera to make us seem less suspicious, and every few seconds more people would arrive, <i>actually shopping for stuff</i>. Disgraceful. When we finally managed to 
get the entire clip on film without being interupted, his head was almost cut off the top of the film, the audio quality was terrible, and the entire thing was rushed 
out of fear. James criticised Matthew for having no standards of decency, and Matthew laughed like a maniacal IPN. Nevertheless, a Plan B would have to be sought. 
	<br><br>
Despite this being James's video, Matthew saw an opportunity to be nuts, and so rejected his sensible idea to film the video outside IKEA, or in the IKEA car park. 
No, this video was to be filmed in the showroom, or we weren't worthy of the title IPN! We found a nice little desk tucked away in the office section of the showroom, 
towards the back corner of the building. This was perfect! James sat down at the table whilst Matthew maneuvered the filming trolley into position. Lights, Camera, 
Action!
	<br><br>
"Hello MathSoc, I am here to announce some of the 2020 Annual MathSoc Awards, and I'm definitely not filming this in IKEA!"<br>
<i>(Lifts up conveniently placed IKEA mug in front of him, with price tag still attached)</i>
	<br><br>
With our primary mission accomplished (including the guest appearance of the tannoy and a baby screaming at the end), we headed downstairs with our still empty 
trolley to fulfil our secondary mission - buying some useless random crap. Matthew spotted a dish mat, and decided this was a suitable start, even though it wasn't 
particularly crap, as he might actually use it. James countered with a light-up house, made from luminous yellow plastic. This was undeniably random and crap. We 
headed through the towering aisles of flatpack furniture, before arriving at our favourite section of the entire store - the bargain section! Here, Matthew bought a 
discounted IKEA cookbook, despite being completely unable to cook any meals more complex than absolute basics, and James bought some <s>metal snowflake coasters</s>, 
shurikens, meaning he won this round. We queued up, paid for our items, avoided the queue for the bistro and walked out, pleased with our veritable haul of shit. 
	<br><br>
We then wandered up though Grangetown to a park, eventually found our way in through the seemingly sole gate, and sat down as far away from the screaming children 
and <REDACTED> family playing cricket as possible. We ate our lunch, spotted a few trains on the nearby viaduct and admired our collection of shit, whilst also 
discussing Matthew's family's recent 'Healthweek' initiative, whereby they were meant to become more healthy by improving their diets and doing more exercise... 
without going out and doing any exercise, reducing portion sizes or cutting back on the chocolate and desserts everyday. James was rather gobsmacked by the portion 
sizes and lack of greens that Matthew spoke of.
	<br><br>
We then finished our lunch and walked back to Grangetown station, rather exhausted by our first train adventure in almost 6 months. Despite it being only 
mid-afternoon, we returned to Cardiff Central and then caught the train home, ready for a longer train adventure to unexplored regions next time!
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">R<sub>0</sub>=3: "I like sniffing things, okay?"</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Getting tipsy in a pub next to a castle in the pouring rain? This seems like perfectly normal behaviour!</p>
<p>After our escapade to Cardiff, "the big city", according to Mrs Arthur, James was now banned from any further adventures to the east for the time being, and this 
included Swansea. Therefore, from now on, our R0 adventures would have to be West Wales adventures, to James's delight. This meant Matthew would have to catch an 
earlier train than James, which would be... interesting, given Matthew's known perfect punctuality.
<br><br>
Nevertheless, Matthew actually arrived at the station just about on time (despite setting off late), collected his tickets from the machine, passed through the ticket 
barrier and sprinted over the bridge and onto the other platform, making it onto the train with about 10 seconds to spare. He then sat on the train until it reached 
Swansea, reading his book (by Michael Collins). 
<br><br>
The train pulled into Swansea, where Matthew stretched his legs, wandering up and down the island platform. Here, he spotted the fabled SWR TfW train - a sprinter 
which TfW nicked from SWR, kept the livery and stuck a TfW logo on the side. Fantasteg. The train was definitely not stolen. Absolutely not. We would later nickname 
this train "Jezza", and Jezza managed to appear in a great number of our adventures after this. Sadly, today we were unable to travel on Jezza, but fortunately the 
Milford Haven train (which we were taking to Carmarthen) had a number of interesting passengers, including 2 Chinese tourists and a "fat bloke who fills half the 
carriage" - Matthew, 2K2X.
<br><br>
James, meanwhile was rushing to try and make his very tight connection from his bus to Gowerton station, and there was such a high chance he wouldn't make it that 
Matthew was prepared to leave the train. Luckily, when the train pulled into the platform, James was waiting there, and the nuttiness could begin!
<br><br>
Heading west for the first time in 11 months was exciting for both James and Matthew, especially considering that our only trip west had been Sampi 6, in which we 
rattled through all 3 branch lines in a single outing. For the first time, we could actually choose the destinations we wanted to explore, rather than be stuck in 
the shitty termini. Before long, the train was pulling into Carmarthen, where, thanks to chock, we would have to wait for our connection, as only Milford Haven trains 
passed through the town without terminating. Annoyingly, we would discover that there always seemed to be a 1 hour time delay between the Milford Haven trains and 
the Pembroke Dock trains, meaning plenty of waiting about.
<br><br>
We headed into the town, across the bridge, through the bus station, and into the town centre. We had a wander around for a bit, before heading into M&S for some 
crisps, as our tradition dictates. Matthew bought the classic Salt and Vinegar, and James tried out Sweet Chili. James paid, to get the discounted price for the 2 
bags, but was disdainful of Matthew's attempts to pay him back in "chockbits" (coins). After getting slightly lost behind the shop, we then went to Coffee#1 and had 
tea and coffee to wake ourselves up. Matthew had the special Ceylon (which had bergamot in and was floral) and James had a coffee. We then headed leisurely back to 
the station, as we still had time to kill.
<br><br>
Carmarthen station was guarded by 2 security people, whom we'd encounter every time we left the station over the summer. During this adventure though, they were far 
more concerned about compliance with covid regulations than they were with people actually paying their fares. MASKS ON! We dithered between the platforms, switching 
back and forth, whilst also laughing at the shitty rolling stock that was pulling into the station. We crossed over to the other platform and boarded our train at the 
one entrance (out of 4) which hadn't been taped off. Mmm. Social distancey. 
<br><br>
The train pulled off towards Tenby, and we were on our way! Admittedly, we spent most of the journey on the way down sharing memes, as we'd already been through 
this section of the line, and thanks to chock, we couldn't jump on and off even if we wanted to. Cue plenty of Mao and Xi memes, mangoes and sparrows from James, 
which Matthew countered with Australian Star Wars election posters. All of them, however, pale in comparison to this, which Matthew pulled out as his ace:
</p>
	<center><iframe frameborder="0" height="360px" width="640px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cre0in5n-1E" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>
<p>After passing Tenby, the army shooting ranges at Penally, and the campsite straddling the railway near Manorbier, we finally arrived at the penultimate stop on the 
line, Pembroke, where we alighted to find a very nicely decorated single-platform station. We wandered down through the car park, and crossed under the railway 
bridge, before running across a junction leading onto a blind bend, screaming "run me over 'en", to the utter shock of the 2 chinese tourists we'd met in Swansea, 
and had followed our route ever since. They were our fwiends!
<br><br>
We wandered into the town centre, keeping our eyes peeled for pubs participating in Rishi Sunak's 'Eat out to help out' scheme, cafes, or even just shops to grab some 
lunch. We were, however left bitterly disappointed. There seemed to be nothing there at all! Fortunately, at the last moment, as we entered the touristy street 
leading to the castle, we found a fish and chip shop (Rowlies), and bought some fish and chips, before heading down to the river/moat to sit in the beer garden and 
enjoy them. In the rain. Oh, what a wonderful British summer extravaganza! Sitting eating fish and chips in the pouring rain, in a beer garden over an algae-filled 
castle moat. Pure, unadulterated bliss. We talked about how this kind of thing never happens much nowadays, as everyone wants to go on holiday to Lanzarote, Zante or 
Ibiza. James disagreed, saying that the number of emmets in Cornwall meant that they were all invading God's Country!
<br><br>
We finished our fish and chips and climbed up the castle motte to the entrance, where we fumbled with our phones to scan the QR codes from our tickets, we passed 
through the gatehouse and we were in! Yay! We immediately cut across the wet grass (ruining James's canvas shoes) to the first tower on our right (the Henry VII 
Tower), where we saw a lovely dungeon, before climbing up the spiral staircase to see the rest of the rooms in the tower. It was at this point that we discovered 
that James is unable to negotiate spiral staircases. He stumbled his way up, falling over at regular intervals, all to the sound of Matthew laughing hysterically.
<br><br>
One of the first rooms we encountered was the diorama of Henry VII's birth. Naturally, James had to have a photo in front of it. We ran down the corridor that Matthew 
remembered from his school trip to the castle over a decade ago (the corridor seemed a lot smaller now) to a room with a large fireplace (James approved) and a view 
of the local gypsy camp (James also approved), before going down another spiral staircase to the courtyard (cue more stumbling and tripping from James). After a 
quick look at a garderobe, we climbed up more stairs to the battlements (by the Westgate Tower), where we could see for miles! We had a great view of the moat, a 
fantastic view of the old houses in the town centre, and a perfect view of the gypsy camp. Noice.
<br><br>
We attempted to climb up to the flag pole, but it was closed due to chock. This was one of many such disappointments. Pembroke Castle is normally a warren of 
interconnecting corridors and staircases, and it is very very easy to get lost (more fun that way, see?). But thanks to chock, social distancing and one-way systems, 
there would be little chance to lose James in some dungeon somewhere. Damn it!
<br><br>
We then followed the battlements around towards the great hall, passing a smithy, a herb garden, a chapel and yet more passageways which were closed off. Sad. 
Fortunately, many of the rooms in the great hall section of the castle were still open. We saw the Norman Hall and Northern Hall, where James also managed to utter 
some profanity right before we rounded a corner and came face-to-face with a young family. However, to Matthew's utter despondency, the cavern underneath the castle 
(the highlight of the entire trip, not least for the enormous spiral staircase that led down there) was closed! What was the point of the trip now?	
</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Sane.jpg" width="70%"></center>
<p>This was the point. James decided that the sane course of action here would be to crawl into the fireplace, in front of a large crowd of people, and pretend to 
be the serving boy. Look at how wonderfully sane he looks!
<br><br>
We spent a couple of minutes in the pouring rain, attempting to find any rooms or corridors which hadn't been covid-sealed. James then fucked off for a few minutes 
somewhere whilst Matthew read a display about William Marshall, 1<sup>st</sup> Earl of Pembroke (which was very, very interesting)... all in a shower of rain.
<br><br>
We then reunited as the rain dissipated, and climbed up onto the other battlements for some more pictures. We then went to investigate the giant map in the centre of 
the castle courtyard. Pembroke Castle has a giant map of Wales, with all the major castles/abbeys/other historical sites shown as large, named, coloured icons on the 
map, and all the other minor castles/abbeys/historical sites accordingly given smaller, unnamed icons. So, here we had a little meta-NT adventure - all the castles! 
We quickly ticked off all the castles in the dense region of Dyfed, jumped between the multitude of minor locations in Glamorganshire, before heading up north through 
sheepland to the north of Wales, seeing Conwy, Caernarfon and Chester to name a few. We finished off at the northernmost point that James had ever been to! Wow! Not 
bad for a trip to Carmarthen!
<br><br>
We then headed for the penultimate tower (the Barbican/Northgate Towers), where James had a real spastic moment on the stairs, and seemed to forget how to put one 
foot in front of the other. The photos and videos Matthew took of him dying on the spiral staircase will haunt him forever. Matthew meanwhile posed for his own photo 
in a fireplace.
<br><br>
Finally, we tackled yet more spiral staircases in the Gatehouse. We started off in a room detailing the history of Pembroke Castle, and how it was constructed over 
time by its various owners, before moving onto a display about the French "invasion" of Pembroke which was terribly planned, carried out by convicts and stopped by a 
group of local women and infantrymen. These infantrymen became a unit in later years, and the subsequent display was about their own history, as the only unit to 
have battle honours from a British land battle. We then climbed more stairs to see the civil war exhibition, which included yet more fascinating dioramas of people 
being murdered (Pembroke Castle was a focal point during the English Civil War), before finishing off in the final diorama of a medieval family eating in the castle 
dining room - with only knives.
<br><br>
We then headed out of the castle, jumped an entire queue of people waiting to leave (breaking social distancing in the process) and walking to the bottom of the 
motte, back in the town centre. Unfortunately, as enjoyable as the castle visit had been, it had only lasted 90 minutes. Therefore, James came up with a plan!
<br><br>
We descended back towards the beer garden by the moat, to see if we could enter the Royal George pub there, as they were participating in the 'Eat out to help out' 
scheme. Unfortunately, everyone else had had the same idea, and we were told the pub was full. So, it was time for plan B! We crossed the river and walked into the 
pub on the opposite bank. We entered around the back, sat down and gave our contact details. James was taking Matthew drinking!
<br><br>
James, being a seasoned hasher, is now an alcoholic. He not only drinks gin and port like they are water, but he has developed an ability to down pints too. For 
Matthew though, this was his first time in a pub (excluding Spoons). This was all very new and alien to him, and according to James, he seemed to revert back to 
Year 10 Matthew - somewhat mouse-like. James ordered a pint of cider for himself and a half-pint for Matthew to try. After a minute or two, our drinks were brought 
over, and James immediately started gulping his down. Matthew on the other hand...
<br><br>
<strong>James</strong>: Matthew, what are you doing? Do you not like the smell?<br>
<strong>Matthew</strong>: No, I'm just investigating it<br>
<strong>James</strong>: Matthew, it is okay! I'm not trying to poison you!<br>
<strong>Matthew</strong>: I like sniffing things, okay?
<br><br>
As we were now getting drunk in a pub, we came to the conclusion that we must have already exhausted absolutely everything that there was to do in Pembroke... 2 
hours ahead of schedule. As there is nothing Matthew likes less than wandering around purposeless, we decided that the best course of action would be to leave shortly 
and catch the earlier train. Matthew had a few sips of his cider before deciding he didn't like it, James downed his entire pint in one go, James went up to pay, and 
we left, with about 15 minutes to do what had seemed like a half an hour walk on the way out. Whilst tipsy.
<br><br>
So we walked through Pembroke, talking about diverse alcohol-related subjects such as the running trend of James being forced into trying new alcohols in a variety 
of amusing and strange situations, before deciding he loves it and getting as drunk as a fish; and Matthew's taste buds seemingly being able to detect even trace 
quantities of alcohol, despite the regular abuse he subjects his tongue to, thanks to his habit of drinking almost-boiling hot tea. Fortunately though, despite 
James's lack of sobriety, actually knowing where we were going this time meant that we arrived at the station a few minutes ahead of schedule. We walked past our 
Chinese fwiends and had the obligatory station sign photo, before boarding our train home.
</p>
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Pembroke.jpg" width="70%"></center>
<p>Unfortunately, it was only roughly 3 o'clock, and neither of us wanted to return home so quickly. We decided to look up stuff we could do to kill time along the 
way. James suggested Laugharne, but that was too hard to access. Matthew suggested Pembrey, but the walking time was excessive even for him. We checked Burry Port and 
Ferryside but found nothing. Then we checked Carmarthen, where we'd have to spend an hour anyway, and discovered a tea shop - Tea Traders. This would be our second 
port of call on this adventure!
<br><br>
The train pulled into Carmarthen, where once again the security guards enforced mask-wearing and social distancing, and we crossed the bridge back into town, a 
well-trodden route by this point. Matthew remarked that it was sad that the tiny funfair which had popped up by the bridge during Sampi 6 was now absent thanks to 
chock. We entered the town, got slightly lost on the way to the shop, but eventually found it and stood outside awkwardly, as the shop sign said it was closed 
already. Just as we were about to turn around, the owner came outside and invited us in, explaining that he had only 'closed' early due to the town centre being 
abandoned when the rain hit earlier. We stepped inside and were greeted by a sight far better than we had imagined!
<br><br>
All along the wall were shelves and shelves of tea! This was an absolutely vast collection of all types, from Black and White teas, to Green and Oolong, all the way 
to a specialty tea that was grown in the Vale of Glamorgan (Peterston tea estate)! This last tea was descended from the Cornish Tregothnan plantation, and this year 
was their first crop (which explained why it was rather pricey). The owner introduced himself as Paul, and we introduced ourselves in turn. We started a long chat 
about what teas we prefer, with Matthew saying that he liked black teas (especially Ceylon) and some Japanese green teas (Sencha), with James saying that he liked 
<b>no</b> black teas, and only liked Chinese green teas. Paul said that he preferred Oolong. We chose some teas to buy later, and then Paul offered to make us a 
complimentary cup of tea each, from any tea we wanted (<a href="https://teatraders.co.uk/" target="_blank">Tea Traders</a> doubles as both a tea shop and a teahouse, 
so usually you can go and have a cup of tea and a scone during the day, if you don't want to buy a full bag of tea).
<br><br>
We sat down and continued talking, whilst Paul made us some tea each. Matthew went for some Yunnan Orange Pekoe, which he fully intends to buy next time he takes 
Freya to the shop in Carmarthen. Matthew would probably say that Yunnan tea is his new favourite, as it has a really good depth of flavour for a black tea, without 
being overpowering enough to require milk (like Assam). The jury is still out upon whether or not Yunnan would displace his perennial favourite, Ceylon, or whether 
the recent contender Lapsang Souchong would best them both. Other teas which caught Matthew's eye were the Nilgiri and Nepalese teas. Despite this, Matthew ended up 
buying a Kagoshima blend of Genmaicha (sencha mixed with toasted rice) from Kyushu, and Fujian Iron Goddess of Mercy Oolong (Tie Kuan Yim) as a birthday present for 
Freya (which turned out to be her favourite variety of Oolong, after she checked on Reddit).
<br><br>
James had a cup of special 'bug bitten' tea, where insects are encouraged to bite the tea leaves before harvest, changing their chemical composition and producing a 
unique flavour of tea. He enjoyed it very much, and Paul had the second infusion of the tea. James enjoyed his tea so much that he proclaimed that perhaps he liked 
black tea after all, only to be told that this was in fact oolong tea, a partially-oxidised variety somewhere between green and black tea, with the ability to survive 
multiple infusions, each yielding a different flavour profile. This then started a long conversation about different teas, Camellia Sinensis (including the Assamica 
variety), the Opium Wars, and Britain's attempts to grow teas outside China, which were honestly rather funny - we smuggled Camellia Sinensis Sinensis into the Assam 
region, and tried to grow it ourselves, but failed. We then paid Chinese tea masters to come over to help us grow it, only to be told "Why are you trying to grow this 
[Sinensis] here? There is a native tea plant [Assamica] which has already been growing here all this time!"
<br><br>
After learning that Paul gives tea talks in non-Covid times, we finished our teas, and went to buy some more to take home with us. Matthew bought his Genmaicha and 
Tie Kuan Yim, whilst James chose <strong>[REDACTED] (Possibly Lemon Melon, Bug Bitten and Mao Jian?)</strong>. We said goodbye and headed out into Carmarthen once 
more, only to find that we'd missed our train (worth it though) and would have to kill an hour. We wandered around the empty town for a bit, laughing at the graffiti 
on an accupuncture clinic, before getting insufferably bored and heading down towards the river. It was probably at this point that Matthew developed his hatred of 
Carmarthen, as he had spent far longer in the small, empty town than he was able to withstand. Fortunately for him, this wouldn't be his final visit this summer!
<br><br>
Here, we finally brought out our crisps and started eating them, whilst sitting in the light mizzle, facing the freezing cold torrent of a river beneath us. We 
chatted for a bit about how different this summer was, and how long ago last summer seemed and read the partial account of Koppa 2 that Matthew had written recently, 
before Matthew's mum had a fit and called him/texted him n times because he was out 3 nanoseconds past 6 o'clock. James posed for yet another picture, crouching down 
inside a little plastic boat toy, munching on his crisps, before we started to walk back across the river, to the station, and onto our train home.
