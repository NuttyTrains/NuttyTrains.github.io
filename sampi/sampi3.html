	<b>Jumping on and off trains to request-only platforms, on a line with 4 trains per day? What could go wrong?</b>
	<br><br>
	Some people run marathons, in our younger years, these people were seemed as maniacs to us (Although, James is doing a half 
	next march at Pembrey... god, it's in March?! I haven't started training yet.). Seeming we undertook this adventure, you dear 
	reader must see us as hypocrites, as this was not a marathon it was an Ultra. 4.5hrs of jumping on and off trains, continually 
	in the middle of nowhere.	
	<br><br>
	This adventure started like every other, Matthew going from Neath to Swansea, James getting on a bus to Swansea (The bus 
	genes are still strong) and meeting at Swansea, this time at 9am, in inticipation of the <em>0937 service to Shrewsbury, calling 
	at... every little hamlet in the middle of nowhere!</em> This was to be different from the Valley trips as this was planned, in 
	relative advance. We were struck instantly with a delay, as we stood on the platform, with another prospective train nutter, he 
	gleemed with excitement as he watch the two trains being unable to be parted. At this moment, we remembered back to our 
	religious education and thought... "we need moses."
	<br><br>
	Luckily, after much pushing, shoving and huffing by the driver, the two seperated and now we were one step closer to the holy 
	grail of Nutty Train adventures. Soon we were permitted to board, the one car extraviganza, that was to take us all the way up 
	to Shrewsbury. We showed the guard our valley rangers and before we boarded, with timetable in hand, James asked "Now, how many 
	request stops can we call at?", the driver looked slightly puzzled, but at the same time had a gleam in his eyes, he replied, 
	"Well I am sorry boys, we are on a tight schedule, not many", James quickly replied, "Not even Sugar Loaf?", the guard permitted 
	us to stop at Sugar Loaf, for reasons we were to find out later.
	<br><br> 
	We were lucky with our guard as he was a jolly fellow and he liked what we were doing, I suppose it gets really really boring 
	and samey uppa Heart of Wales. For the first part of our journey, part of the lines we had travelled before, we were joined by 
	the locals of Bynea and their associates, we soon were right at home with the counterfit valley people. Ketamine, Stabbings, 
	Domestics, none of that stuff fazed us now! We were joined by some employees of TfW, who took particular interest in our 
	platform escapades. So did the guard, I think this may be the best place to add the fact that the <s>Arriva</s> TfW guards are 
	extremely lovely and understanding of our cause.
	<br><br>
	So we got to the new track and we grabbed our bags and got ready to start jumping on and off, 4.5hrs, this was going to be tough 
	one. So our first 'new' station was Llangenech, we jumped off, not expecting to stop and jumped back on, one down... probably 
	about 30 more to go. So we then did the next stop... and the next... and the next. The next notable stations were the Swansea 
	X13 / 16 termini, so firstly it was Pontardulluis, then Ammandford, which was a little quaint gravelled station with many leaves on the ground. 
	James approved of this station very very much. 
	<br><br>
	So we continued more north, past the places we had heard and then onto new names. We soon had an unexpected visit from the guard, we thought "oh god,
	we are to be chucked off in the middle of nowhere!", but alas, we were to ride for some more stations. The guard said to us, "'right boys, we are goin 
	over the Cynghordy viaduct in a minute, come out to the Cab. I'll call ewe when.". This is why James dubs this adventure as the <em>best</em> NT adventure
	to ever exist. So we went into the cab, the video of which you can see on our home page. IT WAS AMAZING!!!!! No NT adventure since has been as good as that
	moment, and it has taken James a year to write this, life gets in the way. 
	<br><br>
	After that, our day could not be ruined. Nothing could dampen our spirits, we could be as nutty as we wanted and nobody could stop us. However, it got better
	and better. I remember very clearly asking to stop at Sugar Loaf as we exited, the guard said yes. WHAT A LAD. He was amazing and really made this adventure, 
	so thankyou to that guard. So we stopped at Sugar Loaf, it was barren as expected and just interesting. I also remember the fact that it was the guards first 
	time stopping there. He seemed rather excited aswell. However, as with everything, all good things must come to an end. We had a guard change at Llandrindod 
	Wells and this one was a grumpy bugger, which doesn't bare well for our North Walean adventures.

	After a flawless run up to Garth, we missed a few stations before the swap. However, after the change, we coasted through most of the stations we didn't 
	have to stop at. We shouldn't complain because we had a really good job up to this point, but it really took the buscuit when he wouldn't let us off the 
	train even though he stopped there for a good couple of minutes. Plenty of jumping time! He was just very angry for no reason. IT still didn't put a dampener
	on our day, we carried on up the line. I think the highlight of this part of the line was Dolau, it was sooo quaint and nice. It was so pretty. Northwards we 
	continued, we were now the most North James had ever been. 
	<br><br>
	The next part of the line we were crossing back and forth across the welsh border. You'd think the track went in a snaking zig zag pattern, however you'd be wrong. 
	It's just how fucked the welsh border is up north. We were going in a near enough straight line, but the welsh boarder made it such that we went: England, Wales, 
	England, Wales, England, Wales, Wales, WALES, England, England, England, "Cheltenham", England, Wales, England. The rest of the stations were pretty boring. I 
	can't say anything of merit but similarly nothing amazing. So we arrived at Shrewsbury.

	You have to remember that the North is this amazing, wonderous and at the same time, scary place for James. He was, in his south centric head, North. The North is
	somthing to be interested and scared of, they have funny accents and sometimes walk funny. People up north prenounce their h's and use both legs to walk? How?! Why?!? 
	AHHHHHHHH...
	<br><br>
	Right, so I have calmed myself down. The north is sooo scary. I hate it. I understand Thatchers point of view now. We spent our time in Shrewsbury looking for postcards
	and stamps. We then got lost. Getting lost was fun... ish, but we didn't have a lot of time so we went to Subway for food and then flat out ran back to the train station. 
	Speeding through the streets of shrewsbury with our half a foot long sandwich. Luckily we had plenty of time when we got to the station, which we had explored before we left
	into Shrewsbury.
