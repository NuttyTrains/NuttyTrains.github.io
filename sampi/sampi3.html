	<b>Jumping on and off trains to request-only platforms, on a line with 4 trains per day? What could go wrong?</b>
	<br><br>
	Some people run marathons, in our younger years, these people were seemed as maniacs to us (Although, James is doing a half 
	next march at Pembrey... god, it's in March?! (RIP - Matthew, 2021) I haven't started training yet.). Seeming we undertook this adventure, you dear 
	reader must see us as hypocrites, as this was not a marathon it was an Ultra. 4.5hrs of jumping on and off trains, continually 
	in the middle of nowhere.

<p>
	This adventure started like every other, Matthew going from Neath to Swansea, James getting on a bus to Swansea (The bus 
	genes are still strong) and meeting at Swansea, this time at 9am, in inticipation of the <em>0937 service to Shrewsbury, calling 
	at... every little hamlet in the middle of nowhere!</em> This was to be different from the Valley trips as this was planned, in 
	relative advance. We were struck instantly with a delay, as we stood on the platform, with another prospective train nutter, he 
	gleemed with excitement as he watch the two trains being unable to be parted. At this moment, we remembered back to our 
	religious education and thought... "we need Moses."
	<br><br>
	Luckily, after much pushing, shoving and huffing by the driver, the two separated and now we were one step closer to the holy 
	grail of Nutty Train adventures. Soon we were permitted to board, the one car extraviganza, that was to take us all the way up 
	to Shrewsbury. We showed the guard our Heart of Wales rangers and before we boarded, with timetable in hand, James asked "Now, how many 
	request stops can we call at?", the driver looked slightly puzzled, but at the same time had a gleam in his eyes, he replied, 
	"Well I am sorry boys, we are on a tight schedule, not many", James quickly replied, "Not even Sugar Loaf?", the guard permitted 
	us to stop at Sugar Loaf, for reasons we were to find out later.
	<br><br> 
	We were lucky with our guard as he was a jolly fellow and he liked what we were doing, I suppose it gets really really boring 
	and samey uppa Heart of Wales. For the first part of our journey, part of the lines we had travelled before, we were joined by 
	the locals of Bynea and their associates, we soon were right at home with the counterfeit valley people. Ketamine, Stabbings, 
	Domestics, none of that stuff fazed us now! We were joined by some employees of TfW, who took particular interest in our 
	platform escapades. So did the guard, I think this may be the best place to add the fact that the <s>Arriva</s> TfW guards are 
	extremely lovely and understanding of our cause, and have almost always been... more on that later.
	<br><br>
	So we got to the new track and we grabbed our bags and got ready to start jumping on and off, 4.5hrs, this was going to be tough 
	one. So our first 'new' station was Llangenech, we jumped off, not expecting to stop and jumped back on, one down... probably 
	about 30 more to go. So we then did the next stop... and the next... and the next. The next notable stations were the Swansea 
	X13 / 16 termini, so firstly it was Pontardulais, then Ammanford, which was a little quaint gravelled station with many leaves on the ground. 
	James approved of this station very very much. 
	<br><br>
	So we continued more north, past the places we had heard and then onto new names. We soon had an unexpected visit from the guard, we thought "oh god,
	we are to be chucked off in the middle of nowhere!", but alas, we were to ride for some more stations. The guard said to us, "'right boys, we are goin 
	over the Cynghordy viaduct in a minute, come out to the Cab. I'll call ewe when.". This is why James dubs this adventure as the <em>best</em> NT adventure
	to ever exist. So we went into the cab, the video of which you can see on our home page. IT WAS AMAZING!!!!! No NT adventure since has been as good as that
	moment, and it has taken James a year to write this, life gets in the way. 
</p>

<p>
	After that, our day could not be ruined. Nothing could dampen our spirits, we could be as nutty as we wanted and nobody could stop us. However, it got better
	and better. I remember very clearly asking to stop at Sugar Loaf as we exited, the guard said yes. WHAT A LAD. He was amazing and really made this adventure, 
	so thank you to that guard. So we stopped at Sugar Loaf, it was barren as expected and just interesting. I also remember the fact that it was the guards first 
	time stopping there. He seemed rather excited as well. Indeed, as we pulled into the station, even the driver left the cab to come and chat to us for 2 minutes! We 
	talked about how no-one ever used to stop here until Geoff came, and now it was suddenly a popular destination! If we had had a little more time, we would have 
	disembarked and signed the visitor book - illi vitae.

<p>
	However, as with everything, all good things must come to an end. We only had that guard for a few more stations before we arrived at Llandrindod Wells, and the train 
	halted at the platform. We took this time to explore both platforms of the quaint Victorian station, before returning to our 1-carriage wonder after 10 minutes. 
	This is when we discovered that we had had a guard change. This new one was a grumpy bugger, which doesn't bare well for our North Walean adventures. 
</p>
	<center><img width="55%" src="../resources/photos/Llandrindod Wells.jpeg"></center>
<p>
	After a flawless run up to Garth, we missed but a few stations before the swap. However, after the change, we coasted through most of the stations we didn't 
	have to stop at. We shouldn't complain because we had a really good job up to this point. However, that all changed when he wouldn't let us off the 
	train at a request stop, even though we had just stopped there. He even held out his arm to prevent us from disembarking! How rude! To rub salt into that open wound, 
	a few stops later, we stopped at a station for a good couple of minutes, to waste all of the time that we had made, because we were too early and too quick going down 
	the line. That really took the biscuit. He was just very angry for no reason. 
	<br><br>
	Nevertheless, after our fantastic start, this still didn't put much of a dampener on our day. We just carried on up the line. I think the highlight of this part 
	of the line was Dolau, it was sooo quaint and nice. It was so pretty. Northwards we continued, we were now the most North James had ever been. 
</p>

<p>
	The next part of the line we were crossing back and forth across the Welsh border. You'd think the track went in a snaking zig zag pattern, however you'd be wrong. 
	It's just how fucked the Welsh border is up north. We were going in a near enough straight line, but the Welsh border made it such that we went: England, Wales, 
	England, Wales, England, Wales, Wales, WALES, England, England, England, "Cheltenham", England, Wales, England. The rest of the stations were pretty boring - all of 
	the earlier quaintness had gone, and the angry guard was trying his best to make us feel unwelcome. I can't say anything ill about the stations, but similarly nothing 
	amazing. The exception to this was Knighton - a station with a castle feel to it, and our first ever station in England on a Sampi adventure. It gave us quite a 
	buzz to have crossed the border at long last. Before long, we had joined the main line, bidding adieu to the Heart of Wales line.

<p>
	Soon we arrived at Shrewsbury. This was a strange station for James and Matthew, used to being only in Arrivaland. Suddenly there were <i>foreign</i> trains, from 
	<i>The Midlands</i>. Ewww! More amusingly, there were gargoyles in the station - a foreshadowing of the "Northerners" that James was about to encounter. We left 
	the station, took a few minutes to find our bearings, and then walked up the hill from the station, to what had been sold to us as a 'quaint market town'. To put it 
	politely, we want our money back.

<p>
	Anyway, back to the 'North': 
	<br><br>
	You have to remember that the North is this amazing, wonderous and at the same time, scary place for James. He was, in his south centric head, North. The North is
	somthing to be interested and scared of, they have funny accents and sometimes walk funny. People up north prenounce their h's and use both legs to walk? How?! Why?!? 
	AHHHHHHHH...
	<br><br>
	Right, so I have calmed myself down. The north is sooo scary. I hate it. I understand Thatcher's point of view now. 
	<br><br>

	Before I kill myself, let's finish this account: We climbed to the top of the hill in the town centre, then immediately managed to get lost, somewhere that looked very 
	60s and council-y. Trying to escape, we eventually ended up in a multi-storey car park. This was the start of a long-running and great, very great, really truly great 
	NT tradition: ticking off as many multi-storey car parks as we could find, especially if they were in supposedly nice places. TICK!
	<br><br>
	Once back in the town centre, we spent much of our time left in Shrewsbury looking for postcards and stamps. We then got lost again. Getting lost was fun... ish, but we 
	didn't have a lot of time left so we went to Subway for food. Around this time, James had recently discovered that he had a gluten intolerance, and so most bread was 
	now off the menu. So it goes without saying that James was the most enthusiastic advocate of getting lunch from Subway. Matthew said 'Are you sure, James? Your 
	stomach will not forgive you', to which James replied 'Yeaahhh, it'll be fine'. 'It'll be fine', he said. 'It'll be fine', my arse.
	<br><br>
	After buying lunch, we then flat out ran back to the train station - everyone, sing along! 
	<br><br>
	<strong>
	Running down alleyways, knocking down children, <br>
	Dodging cars in the car park, trying to kill them, <br>
	Six inch long sandwiches that melt into pain, <br>
	These are a few of my favourite - <i>TRAIN!</i>
	</strong>
	<br><br>
	We just about made it back to the station with a few minutes to spare, got on our train and headed back down towards South Wales.
	<br><br>
	We passed back down the mainline, then through Ludlow and Leominster, both very pretty towns (the latter of which was Scott's favourite way of misdirecting taxi drivers), 
	of which we saw absolutely fuck all of either. Before very long at all, we had reached our next destination, where for some unknown reason, we seemed to change trains. 
	Whilst I am sure that past Matthew had a good reason for this, current Matthew hasn't got a fucking clue why this was. But there you go, enjoy this photo of us, the 
	final photo from the original NT Montage:
</p>
	<center><img width="55%" src="../resources/photos/Hereford.jpeg"></center>
<p>
	We hardly had any time at all in Hereford, despite Matthew having family there. We spent a few minutes on an ill-fated expedition to a supermarket, as James now felt 
	both starving and wretchedly sick at the same time, on account of the "It'll be fine" sandwich an hour earlier. This accomplished very little apart from almost 
	being run over on a dual carriageway, and having to sprint for our fucking lives in order to catch the train. I swear to God, NT adventures make you fit. We seem to 
	make increasingly impossible connections with each adventure - what are we turning into?
	<br><br>
	Having <i>just</i>, and I mean <i>just</i> returned to the train on time, leaping aboard as the doors were beeping, we set off out of England for the last time. 
	<br><br>
	Now if you have read our Digamma account, you may be aware of the new "Castle Class" trains they have. Unfortunately for us, it looks as if TfW did not get the memo, 
	as these trains were clearly "Cattle Class". Yummy. It was especially yummy for the queasy James, still recovering from his bad decision, and also for Matthew, who 
	was getting progressively more infuriated every time the train bumped and lurched over every microscopic dent in the rails and every <s>chav</s> insect that had 
	wandered onto the tracks. God, the nerve of some <s>'people'</s> creatures - Matthew was busy trying to write a postcard to Freya! Had they no decency at all?
	<br><br>
	We then crossed into Wales and passed a number of historic (by NT's standards) stations - Abergavenny, Pontypool & New Inn and Cwmbr√¢n, but missing out Newport. 
	Big Sad. Markey would have to wait for us a little longer. We also managed to fail to tick off Cardiff Central yet again, because Matthew is a retard (see the 
	next adventure for the conclusion of that tale), and zipped straight through.
	<br><br>
	Now there are 3 stations between Cardiff and Bridgend. Usually, ATW services would skip at least one of these stations, meaning that we expected to miss at least 
	one on our way home. But by some miracle (or by the fact that our train driver may not have been sober - he had just driven through Cwmbr√¢n after all), we decided to 
	stop at all 3 - what a miracle! TICK!
	<br><br>
	Indeed, it was a fantastically productive trip all the way home, and we ticked off every little shitty once-per-2-hour halt on the line, all the way to Neath. But 
	Matthew didn't want to go home just yet, so instead he stayed aboard the train, illegally, and stayed on right until the end, allowing us to tick off Skewen and Llansamlet 
	too. Great Success! After this, we said our goodbyes and went our separate ways home, satisfied by one of the best NT adventures of all time, even to this day.
