	<b> Uh, James, I think there's been a mistake: I don't remember this one </b>
	<br><br>
	Okay. Let's have a think about what is going on. I'm Matthew... or am I James? I'm not sure about that bit. This appears to be a 
	website. Oh look - it is our website! We seem to go on "nutty train adventures" together... we must be really, really weird!
	<br><br>
	It looks like we normally go to Cardiff, before heading up the valleys. Ohhhh - the valleys. Unfortunately, that has bit has come 
	back to me. One can't forget the valleys. In fact, this is starting to come back to me now. I think we had 1 valley left, so I guess 
	we went up this last valley to tick it off... Hmm, that seems plausible. What was it called again? Oh. Oh God. The last valley was 
	Ebbw Vale. I wish I'd forgotten this one.
	<br><br>
	Let's try and start from the beginning, so I can piece together what we did. James caught the train from Swansea, and Matthew joined 
	at Neath. I don't remember buying a valley ranger ticket this time. In fact, I think we'd actually planned this one out - what a complete shock! 
	That normally doesn't happen! It looks like we bought a ticket to Cardiff, and then from Ebbw Vale to... somewhere. That other 
	place escapes my mind. Either way, we got to Cardiff, and then had to leave the station, to change to Platform 0. Platform 0? My 
	memory must be really badly affected. Platform 0 sounds really weird and nutty - but I guess I should be expecting that. Hmm.
	<br><br>
	We caught a train quite early in the morning, I believe, and then we did our thing of jumping on and off the train at every station, 
	running to the station sign, taking a photo, and running back on. I hope I'm not James, because James is the one who has to do all 
	the running - Matthew just stands with one foot on the platform, one foot on the train. Lucky! Not only does he get to not run, he 
	has a chance of being dying. I really hope I'm Matthew.
	<br><br>
	Like all the other valleys, the Ebbw Valley has this strange, semi-postapocalyptic feel to it. Abandoned, decaying industry littered 
	the valley floor, whilst seemingly desolate streets of terraced houses hugged the steep walls of the valley. Yet the Ebbw Valley 
	also seemed more picturesque than the others. Lushious forests filled all remaining space in the valley, as well as magnificent 
	cliffs. It probably helped that the weather that day was amazing, unlike the pouring rain of our previous NT adventures. On the way 
	up, we stopped at π ∟, Risca & Pontymister (possibly the station name we find funniest so far), and <s> Conti Fish Bar Station </s> 
	Newbridge Station. As tempted as we were to sample the culinary delights of the Ebbw Valley, we had to move on.
	<br><br>
	We finally arrived at the terminus...and we underwhelmed? Where was the desolation, the dilapadation, the obligatory supermarket 
	terminus or the general aura of shittiness? Ebbw Vale was such a disappointment. Instead, it terminated at a <i>library</i>! Ebbw 
	Vale had promised us the crowning glory of the valleys, but had failed to deliver. Disgusting.
	<br><br>
	On the way back down, I remember trying to plan the remainder of our journey. Matthew's clever ticketing solution was to start 
	our journey from Ebbw Vale to elsewhere in the middle, doing 1/2 of the return, then the outward journey, followed by the other 1/2 
	of the return. This is technically illegal, but it was going to be fine, because TfW services never had conductors who marked your 
	ticket, right? ... The conductor marked our ticket. We were screwed.
	<br><br>
	Another failing of Matthew's illegal ticketing solution was that we couldn't get out of the barriers at Cardiff without staff assistance. 
	Eventually, we got out and walked to Tesco for some lunch. Here, we purchased the obligatory salt and vinegar crisps, as well as 
	a new NT tradition: coconut macaroons. We got back to the station, were allowed back in, and got on the train again.
	<br><br>
	Feeling he ought to defend his illegal ticketing solution, Matthew explained that it relied upon the Ebbw Vale effect - a secret 
	effect that wasn't even picked up by online ticketing apps - eastbound tickets from Ebbw Vale are cheaper than eastbound tickets 
	from Cardiff, despite passengers from Ebbw Vale having to travel through Cardiff first. We named it the "Ebbw Vale Effect" and 
	explained it as follows:
	<br><br>
	<b>Ebbw Vale Effect [noun]: Ebbw Vale is so shit, they pay people to leave</b>
	<br><br>
	We ate our lunch as we travelled down the line towards Chepstow, passing the Nazi town hall in Newport, and one of our favourite 
	stations, Severn Tunnel Junction. The track then curved up to follow the River Severn, as we headed out of Wales once more. Along 
	the banks of the Severn, our sprinter passed fields of cattle and 2 Magnox nuclear power stations. Yum. Radiation. We were headed 
	towards Gloucester (which had some very nice mosaics in the station), but I distinctly remember not staying there - we definitely 
	went one stop up the line. But where could that be?
	<br><br>
	<b>Oh. My. Word.<br>
	Now I remember everything.<br>
	This wasn't a normal place we visited. Not some crappy valley town or picturesque rural hamlet. No.<br>
	We went to "Cheltenham".</b>
	<br><br>
	I feel as if I should begin our account of "Cheltenham" by dispelling a common misconception about the town: namely, that "Cheltenham" 
	is a real place.
</p>
	<center><p><b>"Cheltenham" is not a real place.</b></p></center>
<p>
	In fact, "Cheltenham" is completely fake. The houses, the streets, the shops, the people - everything. Everything is entirely fake.<br>
	You see, "Cheltenham" was built around the new HQ of your friend and mine, GCHQ, in 2003. When they built their new HQ, they had 
	to try and make it blend in, so they decided to construct an entire fake town around it, to try and help cover it up. In hindsight, 
	the Magnox nuclear power stations on the way in made complete sense. The radiation dosage you recieve through the plastic windows 
	of the sprinter over the miles of track by the riverside is so high, that it drugs you into believing that "Cheltenham" is actually 
	real. Fortunately, we had both played some of Professor Layton before - we knew how Folsense worked, so we weren't going to be 
	fooled here!
	<br><br>
	When we arrived in the station, it was immediately obvious that the town was fake. It was a really poor simulation. The TfW train, 
	which was meant to head back down the tracks to Wales, instead carried straight on for a few hundred yards, came to a halt, so the 
	driver could get out and have a fag. What was going on? We then left the station, and proceeded to walk towards the epicentre of 
	the simulation - the GCHQ HQ. We passed through a completely fake estate, with generic streets of generic houses named after poets. 
	They didn't even try to make it seem real.
	<br><br>
	We passed some shops, at which point some vehicles started to follow us. Shit. They knew we were outsiders. They recognised us from 
	our internet traffic. They knew who we were, where we were going, and what we were thinking. We started to run down the street, but 
	they kept up their pursuit. When we ran across the road in front of them, they tried to run us over - they couldn't allow outsiders 
	to get that close to the HQ! Fortunately, when we rounded the corner, they backed off. We then walked through a fake council estate 
	of blocks of flats, but secretly, they were just filled with communication and surveillance equipment. They didn't even try to hide 
	it - you could see the "TV aerials" in each apartment. Not only that, but the blocks of flats had triangular rooves like houses 
	- that is just sloppy simulation.
	<br><br>
	We reached the main road, then walked up to the HQ itself. We didn't dare walk right up to the barbed-wire fence - we didn't want to 
	tempt their snipers any further! We realised that they probably recognised us - we'd probably been there 7 times before, and they'd 
	sorted us out after each adventure - yet here we were again!
	<br><br>
	We then walked along the main road to the town centre, which was a much longer walk than we anticipated, but it allowed us to take 
	in all the fake sights along the way. We saw the GCHQ primary schools, where they train little children to hack other intelligence 
	agencies, we saw the rows of houses, complete with elderly women, the most low-tech mass surveillance weapon in existence, and the 
	<i>armada</i> of buses with <b>GCHQ</b> emblazoned on them. Matthew and James were absolutely rolling with laughter at how poorly 
	kept the secret is within "Cheltenham". We even saw the fake postboxes with people inside, so Matthew waved to the postbox and James 
	started talking to it through the letter slot. What a poor simulation. Along the way, we also laughed about Room 5. It was everywhere...
	<br><br>
	Everywhere...
	<br><br>
	We reached the town centre, and marvelled at the streets of fake shops, including a fake motorcycle garage, and a fake inn. We 
	headed up to the main street, where we admired the fake buildings and fountains, then crossed the street (dodging the GCHQ buses) 
	and went into the T2 shop. We both love tea, so this was a huge mistake. We each ended up buying a box of loose leaf tea, which, 
	admittedly, was the non-fake thing we had in Cheltenham. That and the ice cream in the fake park. T2 had some interesting teas, 
	including some sickly sweet ones and some very smoky ones. Matthew went for Morning Sunshine (Darjeeling+Assam+Rwandan) and James had 
	Morrocan Dreams mint tea.
	<br><br>
	Unfortunately, despite running for a reasonable distance, we missed our scheduled train out of "Cheltenham", meaning that 
	we decided to catch the later CrossCountry service (all the way from the North to Penzance). We got to the station, picked up some 
	timetables, and returned to reality at last.
	<br><br>
	As it might be expected, the long-haul service both smelt bad as was crowded, so the three of us sat by the doors. When the conductor 
	arrived, he was too tired to care about our illegal ticketing solution, so he stamped our tickets and moved on. We were on the 
	for about 20 minutes, before we arrived at Bristol Parkway, our last station for the day. Eventually, we caught the GWR train back to 
	Cardiff, whereupon Matthew was coerced into eating an entire bag of salt and pepper crisps by James on the packed one-carriage wonder 
	(at rush-hour) home. Less than 2 weeks later, Matthew and James would head out once more for another NT&#993; adventure. We will not, 
	however, be making another trip to "Cheltenham" - we have already been 7 times... or was it 8? I can't remember.
