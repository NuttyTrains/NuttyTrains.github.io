	People say, fool me once, shame on me, fool me twice shame on you. We feel the same thing may not be true for the Valleys, 
	as there was no fooling here, we went up by choice! So we started this one slightly later than the other NT adventures, in the 
	middle of the afternoon, but we still had plenty of time for insanity, don't you worry dear reader!
	<br><br>
	1 trip up the valleys evidently wasn't enough to satiate our appetite for masochism, so just a few days after Christmas, we 
	headed back for more. Armed with another Valleys Ranger ticket, we departed from Cardiff Central yet again, and jumped upon the 
	first valley train we saw, this time up the Rhymney Valley! We initially followed the same tracks as on our last journey, but 
	then curved eastwards to tackle possibly the dodgiest valley of them all. The Rhymney Valley was the longest of the valleys, 
	with numerous stations to tick off. That meant plenty of running at various stations for James. 
	<br><br>
	It took us a while to work out where we were as we approached Caerphilly, as the town appeared to have multiple stations (it 
	turns out it had 3). From the elevated track, we could see for miles - we could see the castle in the distance... and the town, 
	unfortunately. Having gone up the valleys expecting steep gorges and narrow openings in the rock, the plain around Caerphilly 
	disorientated Matthew a little, but we quickly progressed to nuttier valley towns, to make sure he was kept insane.
	<br><br>
	Fortunately, the track soon became nuttier, until we were held at a halt, awaiting the green signal to move onto the single 
	track line. This was Matthew's first journey on a single track railway. We rattled up the line, now surrounded by the familar 
	sights of terraced houses, valley sides that blotted out the sun in the late afternoon, disused mine workings, crowds of drug 
	addicts having domestics, and the sight of old women glaring out of their windows at this new fangled train travelling way too 
	fast through <u>their</u> village. 
	<br><br>
	On the way up, we unfortunately missed Gilfach Fargoed, due to the strange service pattern in the Rhymney Valley. We will visit 
	Gilfach Fargoed one day, in order to tick it off as our final Valley Line station - the crowning glory on our trusty map. When 
	there, we will also recreate the famous VF video when measuring the platform! The train rattled all the way up to 
	Rhymney, where we disembarked, to take our photo in front of the sign once more, continuing our tradition. It was 
	getting dark already, so after wandering about the station and the vincinity for 10 minutes, we got back on the train 
	to Cardiff.

	On the way back, we tucked into a bag of Salt and Vinegar crisps (which we'd been saving since Cardiff). Here was yet another 
	NT tradition, forged in the fire of the valleys, on those early December adventures. When we approached Cardiff, James 
	expressed a desire to do a Geoff and Vicky, so we disembarked at Heath High Level, and sprinted down the slippery 
	staircase, along the main road, before turning down a dodgy alleyway to to Heath Low Level, on the City Line. The 
	rickety pacer emerged from the tunnel a few minutes later, and we continued down the track to Cardiff Queen Street. 
	Once again, we disembarked here, but this time, decided to wander through Cardiff City Centre. 
	<br><br>
	Fortunately, we had been hardened by the sights of the valleys, so no amount of violence or drug abuse could scare us now. We 
	walked to St Davids shopping centre, and decided to try Nandos, to see what all the fuss was about, but were thoroughly 
	underwhelmed. We reminisced about our school days and about what we'd been up to recently, before getting back on the train and 
	heading home. A few days later, James had to head back to Cornwall, meaning this was the last NT adventure that Christmas.
