	This was the first of the Nutty Trains adventures, although at the time it was very impromptu. Having just finished in college 
	for the morning, just a few days before Christmas, Matthew decided to meet James. I feel that the following exchange should be 
	quoted: 
	<br><br>
	<b> J: Well, what are we going to do today?<br> 
	M: You fancy going on the trains?<br> 
	J: Valleys?<br> 
	*both laughing*<br> 
	M: Yes [eyes glowing with insanity]</b>
	<br><br>  
	Without giving it any rational thought, we were off! At this point we hadn't decided where we were to go, but we knew we 
	were destined for the valleys, the rules were made as we travelled to Cardiff on an Arriva Coradia. The tension built as we 
	counted down the stations to the real start of NT.  We discovered the Valleys Ranger ticket, which allowed us unlimited travel 
	throughout the valleys that day, which we purchased in Cardiff, to the great amusement of the ticket office staff. 
	<br><br>
	When we arrived at CDF, we checked the boards for the next train up the Valleys, and it seemed we were destined for Treherbert. 
	Ad Treherbert! We rolled off the platform, in a sprinter, and towards the Valleys, this was soon to be a massive culture shock 
	for James, lets go up the Valley's he said, it'd be fun he said, fun it was indeed and very humourous to Matthew.
	<br><br>
	We went 'north', as the map led us to believe (we were actually travelling west), up past Cathays, Llandaff, Radyr, which soon 
	became very familiar to us, after numerous escapades into the deepest, darkest fringes of 'civilisation', as we continued our 
	masochism. To avoid the ire of commuters in Cardiff, we decided to switch carriages every time we visited a station. In this 
	way, another NT rule was born, completely impromptu. Whilst still in the Cardiff city boundary, we noticed successive stations 
	becoming quieter and more dilapidated, a sign of things to come.
	<br><br>
	The city ended abruptly after Radyr, and we were surrounded by nice contryside, only for it to give way to a massive industrial 
	estate, followed by miles and miles and miles of terraced houses, row after row. We were now penetrating the valleys. On the way 
	up, we jumped off, took pictures and then jumped back on quickly at every station apart from Nantgarw, <s>the best station 
	ever</s>, because the Treherbert train didn't call at Nantgarw. As we ascended further, evening drew in, and the forests 
	clinging to the ever-steeper valley sides became shrouded in mist, then draped in a thick fog.
	<br><br>
	The colour of the sky had acquired a faint brown tinge by the time we hit Treorchy, but we still weren't at the terminus. We got 
	many puzzled looks on our upward journey - why would anyone put themselves through this torture? Someone asked 'right boys, so 
	what 'ewe doin' then?', the first of many such people, on all our adventures. Treherbert was our first real taste of the valleys. 
	We got out of the train, and stood on the single platform, in front of a row a terraced houses overlooking the railway. The 
	track continued into a disused tunnel, stretching further up the valley. 
	<br><br>
	The valley itself began to climb sharply, with the trees thinning and giving away to gorse and bracken, and a light rain was 
	falling, feeling almost like a veil. It really looked like the end of the world. The village was similarly abandoned. Fewer than 
	5 passengers got on or off the train, no-one was waiting by the bus stop, and the streets of terraced houses were desolate and 
	abandoned. It was startling to think that we were only about 10 miles away from home. It was almost as if we were in another 
	world.
	<br><br>
	We got back on the train, and sat down to plan our next journey. Dusk was rapidly approaching and the rain was now very heavy, 
	but we decided to change at Pontypridd and head to Merthyr Tydfil. We arrived in Pontypridd (surprisingly, a very nice and very 
	large station) and ran from platform to platform in the rain and over the bridge, laughing at our lack of sanity (a regular 
	occurance for these adventures - James would later remark that an NT adventure was more tiring than a parkrun), then joined a 
	group of locals waiting on some dodgy side platform for our first pacer of the day to arrive - it was time to try and get 
	killed a second time! 
	<br><br>
	<b>This isnt tourism its masochism </b>
	<br><br>
	The locals on the platform were diverse and varied - a real taste of the cosmopolitan nature of the valleys - several family 
	groups having seperate domestics, stopping only to stare at us, ket-users, crack-users, spice-users and weed-users, all looking 
	at us in disdain for disturbing their illegal obsessions, and the elderly women from up the valley, having finished their annual 
	trip to the great city of Pontypridd, watching us outsiders like hawks. We alighted a double (class 800) pacer and went back up 
	north, to torture ourselves once more. The stations got slowly more and more desolate and poor as night drew in. We stood in the 
	wheelchair area whilst our fellow passengers enjoyed their drugs.
	<br><br>
	At this point, it was dark, raining and everybody on the train feared for their lives as the pacer hurled itself down the track, 
	at speeds that felt illegal. The windows were shaking, the doors were opening mid-journey, the roof was leaking, half the seats 
	were missing, water was streaming down the inside of the windows, and the brakes on the train screamed into life every time the 
	train went too far over the speed limit, all in the pitch black of night. 
	<br><br>
	We carried on jumping on and off the train and drawing attention to ourselves, especially from the bloke brandishing a knife and 
	doing Ketamine. All we knew about ketamine was that it contains Benzene ‚è£ (A2 Organic Chemistry). Fortunately, laughing 
	maniacally every time something went wrong with the train, repeating "This is nuts, this is nuts, this is really, truly nuts" 
	ad nauseam, and having an insane glint in our eyes kept the other passengers at bay. They weren't the most deranged ones on the 
	train that day!
	<br><br>
	As we pulled into the wonderful town of Merthyr Tydfil, having just run down to the sign at Pentre-Bach, we noticed that the 
	train had terminated in the middle of a Tesco car park. Duly, we renamed the station on our faithful (now historic) map as 
	'Merthyr Tydfil Tesco Station'. This was our cue to go for a run. The guard told us: "We depart in 5 minutes boys", so we had 5 
	minutes to explore Merthyr Tydfil Tesco. Despite this being only our first adventure, whilst visiting it we knew this station 
	was to be legendary in relation to NT stations and we still to this day aim to find the stations as legendary as Merthyr Tydfil 
	Tesco. It has even seen off fierce competition from Maesteg Asda Station, Fishguard Harbour and Camborne! We took our photo in 
	front of the station sign, which was the first of many.

	Having thoroughly explored the entrance to Tesco, we got back on the train, and settled into the long journey back to Cardiff. 
	On the way back down, we ticked off the final missing station, Nantgarw, which TfW insists is actually called 'Treforest Estate'. 
	Rubbish. We got to tick that legendary station off on the way back. It is a weird station with just one island platform, in the 
	middle of two tracks. James couldn't spot how it worked, so just took the photo and jumped back on, but Matthew, having already 
	been there twice before, explained that it had some dodgy tunnel leading out from the centre, under the tracks, and onto a dirt 
	track through an industrial zone. Legendary.
	<br><br>
	Having arrived in Cardiff, and with 22 stations ticked off, we'd done well, so you'd think called it a day then. No, of course 
	not. There are plenty more stations to tick off! We arrived back to Cardiff Queen Street, with our lives in our hands and 
	disembarked with the druggies gang members and valley folk. We ran to the side platform for the sprinter shuttle service to 
	Cardiff Bay, and travelled down to tick off our final Cardiff/valleys station that day. At this point we were hungry and we 
	decided on a classic Pizza Express, which was still a recent discovery for us and soon to become a go-to for food and another 
	NT tradition. 
	<br><br>
	James made a mistake by ordering the hottest pizza they offered "Because quadrilaterals > circles", then proceeded to eat of 
	all the mitigating goats cheese off the pizza, leaving only the spicy bits behind. He had a fun time enjoying the remainder of 
	his meal, needless to say. As we headed back to the station, the nuttiness was rekindled in us after some food and it was time 
	to 'wait' for the train. Yeah... instead of waiting, we walked to the end of the platform and then raced the train back down the 
	platform. (Matthew won).
	<br><br>
	We headed back to Cardiff Central, then got a Class 800 back to Swansea and Neath respectively and ticked off the rest of the 
	stations on the mainline PAD services. What an amazing end to our first full adventure.
