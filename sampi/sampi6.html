	<b>It was time to leave behind the comforting smells of ketamine and crack cocaine in the valleys, and venture to distant termini,
	in a galaxy far, far away.</b><br>
	Disclaimer: I promise this time that really did happen. I have not had my mind erased this time! James and Matthew now had the 
	terrible dilemma of having exhausted all the stops (bar Gilfach Fargoed) in the valleys. It was time to start venturing further 
	afield. We had planned &#993;5 on a whim in James's kitchen a few days before, but we planned &#993;6 extensively. It had taken 
	Geoff and Vicky most of the day to do it using an impure solution (albeit, travelling from Cardiff), so we were going to have issues. 
	Fortunately, Matthew was able to divise a Heath Robinson way of doing it, using his trusty timetables, blackboard and coloured chalk.

<p>
	We set off from Swansea at 10am, and headed west, ticking off the intermediate stations beyond Llanelli. Here, we were lucky with 
	request stops, a theme which fortunately continued all day. We hit Carmarthen, then Whitland, before barrelling down the same route 
	we took over a year before during Î²2, towards Tenby. Amazingly, we hit all the request stops bar Saundersfoot on the way down, despite 
	having resigned ourselves to the fact that we probably weren't going to be very successful with request stops that day.
	<br><br>
	We arrived at Tenby, and the train stopped for a few minutes. It turned out that the guard on the train that day recognised us 
	from a previous adventure, so knew exactly what we were doing already (he was very helpful in letting us know about request stops). 
	We had a wander around the station, just like we'd done before, then boarded the train to venture deeper into Pembrokeshire. We 
	passed beautiful campsites, took in amazing sea views, and saw picturesque castles along the way. The stations towards the end of 
	the line also became quite quaint, with twee station buildings, single platforms, and beautiful flower beds. We also started to 
	draw the attention of our fellow passengers, who were intrigued as to what we were doing. Fortunately, James had business cards 
	with this website's <a href="https://www.jsites.co.uk" target="blank">original URL</a> printed on them to explain! We started talking to 
	2 elderly women, who recommended we visit a particular cafe in Pembroke Dock (our first terminus), and were very enthused by what 
	we were doing. We later ran into them in Asda in Pembroke Dock.
</p>	
	<center><img width="55%" src="../resources/photos/Pembroke Dock.jpg"></center>
<p>
	Pembroke Dock was a nice station, but the town was more questionable. Using Matthew's talent for finding the nearest supermarket/
	70s shopping centre/70s car park, we headed to Asda for some lunch. Walking down the street of shops on our way out (eating our 
	lunch), we passed a shop entitled <b><q>Pembroke Dock: Birthplace of the Millenium Falcon</q></b>. I told you I wasn't lying!
	<br><br>
	As always, we then managed to find ourselves in the scummier end of Pembroke Dock, before approaching the docks themselves. We 
	marvelled at the scale of the old docks, and also the enormous, comically large bridge across the estuary. It was here, standing by 
	the waterfront, that we decided to create this website. We then walked around the town some more, coming far too close to various 
	old miltary complexes, before heading back into the town centre to look for tea (unsuccessfully). Finally, we headed down to the 
	station, and set off, back to Carmarthen, ticking off our final stop on the branch line (Saundersfoot) on the way.
	<br><br>
	We arrived in Carmarthen at half past 2, and had almost exactly an hour to kill. Luckily, we had arrived in the land of Mrs Jones, 
	which James knew surprisingly well. We walked across the footbridge, tried to get killed crossing the A40 (which, incidentally, 
	was the road we tried to get ourselves killed on whilst crossing it in "Cheltenham"), before heading into the town centre. The town 
	centre flabberghasted Matthew. He could not fathom how such a backwater like Carmarthen could afford such a massive redevelopment 
	scheme, and continue to house more large shops than Swansea. Despite James's best efforts to rationalise it, Matthew remained baffled.
	<br><br>
	We left the main shopping parade, and turned down a side street to a little cafe called Pethau Da. It had a sun for a logo, which 
	looked very inviting, so we headed in. We sat down on a table underneath the staircase, and ordered some tea each. If I remember 
	correctly, Matthew ordered peppermint tea, and James had the rather unusual apple and mint. James's was especially tasty. 
	<br><br>
	Unfortunately, time started to tick down, and eventually we only had 12 minutes to get to the station. If we missed the train, then 
	our schedule for the rest of the day would be thrown. So Matthew downed his boiling tea, James got a takeaway cup for his, and we 
	walked out of the door. Then ran. We sprinted down the shopping parade, turned sharply down the staircase, passed a bus station/entrance 
	to a car park, sprinted across the A40, and made it to the footbridge with 3 minutes to spare. Now in pieces, we walked leisurely 
	across the bridge, before catching the train, and sinking into our seats to recover.
	<br><br>
	We had half an hour's journey to our next stop, Clunderwen, but we feared that our luck might start to run out as we ventured 
	into the request stops once again. And yet, by some miracle, we managed to stop at every stop on the line on the way down. However, 
	we became too comfortable on the train, and were not prepared for Clunderwen. Disaster struck! We arrived late at the carriage doors, 
	James's phone was off, and Matthew wasn't ready to jump off to take the photo himself, so we missed the station! Disaster! What were 
	we going to do? Disheartened, we stayed by the doors, but luckily managed to tick off Clarbeston Road and Haverfordwest (we missed 
	Johnston upon seeing how busy the station was), before arriving at Milford Haven, where we took our obligatory photo in front of 
	the station sign.
	<br><br>
	Milford Haven station was just a single platform with a shelter, and was more like a valley station than a former HST terminus. 
	It didn't even have the longitudinal signs we were used to (hence our photo is of the BR totem pole instead). We left the station, 
	walked up the steep path to the roundabout, cut along a few grass banks, before climbing the road up towards the town centre, 
	passing the marina to our right.
</p>

<p>
	Admittedly, we weren't quite prepared for what we saw. The town was perched on a steep cliff, with the road sharply climbing 
	around the perimeter, meaning we were unable to see the seaside town we had been expecting. Instead, we were greeted by the biggest 
	industrial complex west of Port Talbot! The lovely marina with its sleek yachts gave way to the gritty industrial port with 
	gargantuan oil tankers, and as we rounded the hill, we had a better view of the opposing bank of the inlet, where 2 huge oil tankers 
	were berthed, next to a large and complex network of pipes, looking like something out of a science-fiction film. The web of pipes 
	and tubes fed into a series of vast concrete domes and silos embedded into the hill in an irregular, almost fungoid-like manner, 
	behind which a forest of concrete chimneys and steel flue pipes erupted from the crest of the hill. Looking to the east, we saw 
	5 towering chimneys looming over a large concrete building, which we naturally assumed to be a nuclear power station. As you can 
	imagine, this super-industrialisation was not what Matthew and James were expecting to find in deepest, darkest Pembrokeshire, 
	especially as they had spent the morning <i>on the opposite bank</i>, next to the nuclear power station and the oil refinery!
	<br><br>
	Some of James's friends in Cornwall messaged him to ask for the lovely pictures of beautiful, rural Pembrokeshire he had promised 
	them. Hmm, that was going to be a problem. It later transpired that the oil refinery we were looking at was actually just one of 
	4 surrounding the town in a ring of pollution. Wow, so rural.
	<br><br>
	We had more pressing concerns at this point though. We had a town to explore and food to find. The town centre, as expected, was 
	pretty much abandoned. The whole shopping street was filled mainly with derelict shops, so we kept climbing to the crest of the 
	hill. At the very top, we reached a 3/5 food hygiene rating fish and chip shop. Assessing our risk of death to be only moderate, 
	we headed in to order chips for James. The shop wasn't as bad as we feared, but Matthew did watch a spider plunge into the vat 
	of chips, luckily after James had been served!
	<br><br>
	With 15 minutes until the train, we ate our chips as we leisurely walked down the hill towards the station, for once, without sprinting! 
	We caught our train, finished the chips, and ticked off Johnson on the way back. Once again, we hit every request stop, which 
	gave us hope that we'd have a chance to tick off Clunderwen. Even though we suggested measures as extreme as altering the NT rules 
	to tick it off, Matthew was determined to remedy his mistake, and tick it off the old-fashioned way. As predicted, we pulled up 
	at the station, except this time Matthew ran onto the platform, armed with his phone to get a picture, whilst James stood guard. 
	For once in his life, his phone actually took a decent picture (on the 3rd attempt), and Matthew dashed back on, having officially 
	completed his NT initiation! Clunderwen was our final request stop of the day, and we were delighted to have ticked them all off, 
	despite thinking it would be an impossible task!
	<br><br>
	Our guard on the first train had warned us about Whitland: don't get off, there is nothing there! Unfortunately, the timetables meant 
	that in order to catch our final train, we had to alight here instead of Carmarthen. So duly, we alighted, and were abandoned in 
	some desolate village in rural West Wales, on a Thursday evening as dusk drew in. The guard hadn't lied. The village was empty.
	Almost uniquely in our adventures, we managed to explore almost the entire town in our short stay there (admittedly, we didn't get 
	to the 2 neighbouring villages). We found the most interesting things to be the town hall, the co-op, and the public toilets, 
	which appeared to be in someone's back garden. Odd.
	<br><br>
	With 15 minutes to go, we waited on the platform in the shelter (coming into contact with another train nutter, unfortunately), 
	and we discussed the looming prospect of university, less than 2 weeks away for James, and less than 4 weeks for Matthew. Even then, 
	sitting there on the desolate platform in the atmospherically fading light, we could scarcely comprehend the magnitude of the 
	seminal change we were facing.
	<br><br>
	We boarded the train, and set off on our final branch, to Fishguard. The Fishguard branch has only 2 stations; Fishguard and Goodwick, 
	and Fishguard Harbour. The former was as we expected - a similiarly twee village station to the ones on the Pembroke branch. The latter 
	was possibly the strangest station we had ever encountered.
	<br><br>
	The train wound its way along the sheer cliff-face, as it plunged ever further into the deepest workings of the harbour. Despite 
	having visited 2 maritime termini already that day, we had never been afforded access into the docks like this before. We passed 
	towering cranes and high fences, stacked containers and fishing trawlers. Yet again, everything seemed incredibly desolate. 
	<br><br>
	By the time we pulled up at the single platform and alighted, the sky had acquired a grey tinge, befitting the dark and gloomy ferry 
	terminal at which we had arrived. We headed inside to see an empty departure board, a shuttered-up ticket office, and scores of empty 
	seats, all awaiting a ferry that would seemingly never come. The steel columns and beams in the station were slowly rusting, and the 
	windows overlooking the opposite cliffs were grimy and stained. This was an immensely atmospheric and strange station. 
	<br><br>
	We headed outside to admire the cliffs, before James tried to find a way over the high fences towards the sea - his inner Cornishman 
	was calling him! One by one, our fellow passengers got into their cars and drove off, leaving just us and the train nutter behind 
	(James fortunately shouted this fact out, reasonably loud, in those exact terms, right as he was behind us). We took our station 
	photo, burst out laughing at what James had just done, and headed back home.

<p>
	Night quickly set in as the train headed down the tracks, through all the stations we had visited, back to Swansea. Along the way, 
	we continued to discuss the future. Even more so than after GCSEs, this truly felt like the end of an era. Everything was going 
	to change. James was going to be living on his own in Cornwall, whilst Matthew would be moving to London on his own a few weeks 
	later. There was no going back.
	<br><br>
	Fortunately, the discussion took some lighter turns. We discussed the formation of this new website, and laughed about all the 
	adventures we could have in future, including whether we could invite any other friends along. The train eventually pulled into 
	Swansea at 9pm, in the pitch black, where James alighted to catch his bus, and Matthew caught the train home. And so ended NT &#993;6.
