	James and Matthew do a thing - a thing they wanted to do for a long time!
	<br><br>
	This NT adventure is a certified production of Markeyland - all praise Markey!

    <strong>CROESO I AMNESIA ZONE!</strong>
    <br><br>
	Adventure 16 in the Amnesia Zone is a short one, but it is pretty memorable - we'd been planning this one for 4 years, so 1 extra year of waiting for the writeup 
	won't hurt anyone! If we have forgotten anything, it is because some things are painful and are meant to be forgotten...
	<br><br>
	-------------
	<br><br>
	Sometimes, by pure chance, once in a blue moon, James and I happen to end up in the same place at the same time. I know, dear reader - these events are rare 
	and shocking, but you must control yourselves! What would the baby Jesus think if you lost control of yourself on his birthday? That is right - for once, 
	we happened to both be in Wales for non-zero, intersecting days over the Christmas period - it was time for a bonus Christmas adventure!
	<br><br>
	Many years ago, back in early 2019, before PhDs, before masters, before Covid or Imperial, there was Markey. Amen. The glorious Markey let it be known that 
	<strong>The next train will be a <i>Transport for Wales</i> service to <i>Carmarthen</i></strong>. Thanks to glorious Markey, we were able to go on many 
	adventures in 2019, exploring our back garden - South Wales. We managed to tick off almost every station in South Wales over the course of those 6 adventures. 
	In 2021, we belatedly returned after a Covid-induced hiatus (see the <a href="./r0.html">R0 adventures</a> for our Covid exploits in South Wales) to finish the 
	job. After this... we never returned. Things had been going so well in 2019 that we wrote a document including all our future nutty plans, both near and far. 
	Some were truly exotic (e.g. Glasgow), but a couple were very close by. The closest of them all was a single, seldom-used branch line that bypassed both Neath 
	and Swansea, connecting Port Talbot to Llanelli via the old Swansea District line, and passing directly over the River Neath floodplain over a swing bridge. A few 
	services ran over this line, and we thought it would be a fantastic idea to experience this new vantage point over our familiar stomping grounds. Alas, 2021 came 
	and went, and we never returned to Markeyland...<br> UNTIL NOW!
	<br><br>
	As luck would have it, we both happened to be in Wales for a few days longer than expected post-Christmas, and in true NT fashion, we were both pretty stressed 
	and in dire need of some escapism - it was time to dust off the old 'Nutty Bridge' plan and meet in Swansea. In even truer NT fashion, James was dealing with 
	the joys of the buses, and I was so late that he had only a razor-thin margin in which to catch the train...

	I just about made it onto the train with a few seconds to spare, and we were soon off to Llanelli on our long-awaited expedition. This was very exciting - amongst all 
	the challenges we (and especially James) were facing at the time, a return to our roots was direly needed - it was time to pretend we were 17 again!
	<br><br>
	We disembarked at Llanelli, and were greeted by the sounds of violence and police sirens - a very peaceful day in Llanelli. We did not have to wait for long - 
	after only a few minutes, our fabled train had arrived, and we were off! The train initially took us up the Heart of Wales line, through Bynea and Llangennech. 
	This line passes close to the River Loughor, and when the river is not <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-54050372">filled with oil</a>, it can be 
	really pretty, even on a grim December afternoon.
	<br><br>
	After this, we left the Heart of Wales line and turned off onto the branch line that took us through the backend of Swansea, through a series of deep cuttings, 
	and tunnels (in very poor condition), before emerging onto the enormous viaduct that crosses the River Tawe at Morriston. Between us, we had lived in Swansea for 
	almost 25 years, and yet neither of us had ever clocked that this towering viaduct was an active railway line - crossing it for the first time was pretty astonishing. 
	The view of the giant caravan park just after the viaduct was the icing on the cake: this was the true Morriston that we had been expecting!

<p>
	The line then continued towards Llansamlet, through some more deep cuttings, before we emerged into the old BP Llandarcy site. Neither of us were alive when this site 
	closed, so I fully expected to see nothing of interest as we passed through the old industrial wasteland until we passed under the M4. I was wrong. For about a mile, 
	the railway line was bridged by what seemed like <i>countless</i> pipes and gantries and girders: all clearly decaying and abandoned pieces of infrastructure from 
	the old oil refinery. If urban exploration and trains are your thing - this line has you sorted - I have not seen any other passenger railway that looks anything like 
	this, and I have certainly never seen a passenger rail line pass next to/under abandoned oil infrastructure that has been rusting in place for a quarter of a century.
	<br><br>
	The excitement continued (to me, at least) as we passed first under the M4 and then under the canal (part of my local cycle network in Neath), before emerging onto 
	the floodplain and crossing the River Neath on an ancient swing bridge. Growing up, I had never seen a single train cross this bridge, and had been informed it was 
	abandoned - this was clearly all nonsense. Once again, I had lived in this town for almost 15 years - my entire childhood memories were formed in this town, and yet 
	crossing this bridge allowed me to see Neath from a brand-new angle (one that most long-time residents will also never get to see - where we went, there are no roads!), 
	and that was pretty awesome. Finally, we rejoined the mainline at Briton Ferry station and continued to Port Talbot.
	<br><br>
	I will admit, I had not expected to be so blown away by this miniature adventure - after all, this was our least adventurous trip since R0=1, and it came after a year 
	where we had visited Ireland and Paris. Indeed, after a year of stress (for both of us), my memory of this one had decayed quite significantly until I rewatched the 
	shitty phone videos we took this day - then it all came flooding back. I have attached 3 of these video excerpts within this writeup, as it is unlikely a full YouTube 
	video will ever see the light of day: we are simply phenomenally busy nowadays and don't have time to think, let alone start video editing!

	We took the train back to Swansea, and hoping to prolong this trip, we headed into Swansea city centre - Nutty Trains would be hitting Wind Street! (For our non-Swansea 
	audience, this was not only a break of character, but this was taking our lives in our hands!) We headed to No Sign wine bar, of Dylan Thomas fame, and actually found 
	it was surprisingly good! After that we had a few more drinks, my friend Matthew was introduced into the Nutty Trains extended universe, we had a few more drinks and 
	ended up elsewhere, and characteristically by this point, neither of us has any recollection of the end. This was to be expected - 2023 NT had started by getting wasted 
	in Dublin, had continued by getting wasted in Oxford, Paris and Lincoln, and so it was only appropriate that we ended this year by getting wasted in Swansea.
	<br><br>
	The very next afternoon I would be on a train back to Leeds to complete my 1st year PhD examinations in January, and to wave in 2024. Writing in 2025, I can at least 
	confirm that 2024 was an improvement over 2023, especially for Nutty Trains. Join us next time as we return to France on our <strong>final</strong> amnesia zone 
	adventure, and our longest, most extravagant trip yet! Following that, we shall return to more regularly scheduled programming - Koppa, Xi and Digamma. I hope you are 
	excited!
