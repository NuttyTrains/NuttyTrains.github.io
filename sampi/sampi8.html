	James and Matthew do a thing - a thing they wanted to do for a long time!
	<br><br>
	This NT adventure is a certified production of Markeyland - all praise Markey!

    <strong>CROESO I AMNESIA ZONE!</strong>
    <br><br>
	Adventure 15 in the Amnesia Zone is a short one, but it is pretty memorable - we'd been planning this one for 4 years, so 1 extra year of waiting for the writeup 
	won't hurt anyone! If we have forgotten anything, it is because some things are painful and are meant to be forgotten...
	<br><br>

	<br><br>
	Sometimes, by pure chance, once in a blue moon, James and I happen to end up in the same place at the same time. I know, dear reader - these events are rare 
	and shocking, but you must control yourselves! What would the baby Jesus think if you lost control of yourself on his birthday? That is right - for once, 
	we happened to both be in Wales for non-zero, intersecting days over the Christmas period - it was time for a bonus Christmas adventure!
	<br><br>
	Many years ago, back in early 2019, before PhDs, before masters, before Covid or Imperial, there was Markey. Amen. The glorious Markey let it be known that 
	<strong>The next train will be a <i>Transport for Wales</i> service to <i>Carmarthen</i></strong>. Thanks to glorious Markey, we were able to go on many 
	adventures in 2019, exploring our back garden - South Wales. We managed to tick off almost every station in South Wales over the course of those 6 adventures. 
	In 2021, we belatedly returned after a Covid-induced hiatus (see the <a href="./r0.html">R0 adventures</a> for our Covid exploits in South Wales) to finish the 
	job. After this... we never returned. Things had been going so well in 2019 that we wrote a document including all our future nutty plans, both near and far. 
	Some were truly exotic (e.g. Glasgow), but a couple were very close by. The closest of them all was a single, seldom-used branch line that bypassed both Neath 
	and Swansea, connecting Port Talbot to Llanelli via the old Swansea District line, and passing directly over the River Neath floodplain over a swing bridge. A few 
	services ran over this line, and we thought it would be a fantastic idea to experience this new vantage point over our familiar stomping grounds. Alas, 2021 came 
	and went, and we never returned to Markeyland...<br> UNTIL NOW!
	<br><br>
	As luck would have it, we both happened to be in Wales for a few days longer than expected post-Christmas, and in true NT fashion, we were both pretty stressed 
	and in dire need of some escapism - it was time to dust off the old 'Nutty Bridge' plan and meet in Swansea. In even truer NT fashion, James was dealing with 
	the joys of the buses, and I was so late that he had only a razor-thin margin in which to catch the train...

	I just about made it onto the train with a few seconds to spare, and we were soon off to Llanelli on our long-awaited expedition.
