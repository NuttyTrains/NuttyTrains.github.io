	It's back to the future: Uppa valleys yet again, to finish what we started 2 years ago, featuring a very special guest! We break into a sixth form college, 
	run down a river screaming, and get abandoned for 2 hours in the dark whilst drinking 100 coffees!
	<br><br>
	<strong>
	The next train to arrive at PLATFORM DAI is the SAMPI 7 service to GILFACH FARGOED, calling at TREHERBERT, PONTYPRIDD OFF-LICENCE, CAERPHILTHY CRACK-DEN and

  	PLATFORM DAI for the SAMPI 7 service to GILFACH FARGOED.

	<br><br>
	It had taken a very long time for the stars to align for this adventure to happen. First, chock had to reduce enough so that we could do proper NT again, unlike 
	summer 2020. Second, we both had to be back in Wales at the same time, and by the time we were heading into 3rd year, this wasn't as easy as it had once been - 
	neither of us really wanted to be in Wales very often now. Thirdly, we also had to pick a time when Ewan was also free, as he had been waiting for a very long time 
	to experience NT first-hand. But finally, in the first week of September 2021, the stars aligned and this adventure looked possible. At long last, we, Ewan, and our 
	many YouTube viewers were going to have the chance to experience the nuttiness of a Sampi - where NT began all those years ago. It was time for Sampi VII: The Greatest Hits!
	<br><br>
	Just as with any Sampi, it would not be complete without Matthew nearly fucking everything up at the very beginning. A mere 15 minutes before the train left Neath, he 
	was still lying in bed, thinking about whether or not he could afford 2 more minutes of sleep. He threw his clothes on, sprinted down the stairs, got in the car, whereupon 
	his dad floored it to the station, and Matthew ran out. He bought his tickets, ran through the barrier and screamed onto the train doors right before it left. It 
	simply wouldn't have been an authentic experience for Ewan if Matthew had been on the platform before the train arrived!
	<br><br>
	Once on the train, he met Ewan and James already there, laughing at how late he had left it yet again. The three of us then headed to Cardiff, eager to see what nutty shit 
	we could get up to back uppa valleys!

	We reached Cardiff Central, passed through the ticket barriers, bought our Valley Rangers (oh, it had been far too long since we'd had one of those), and then stood in 
	the station concourse, thinking about our first plan of action. Seeing the new BBC HQ behind us, this question was answered for us. As we work for the BBC, we decided 
	we would simply walk in!
	<br><br>
	This failed.
	<br><br>
	We spat on HMRC, and Matthew tried to end his life by crossing a road directly in front of an accelerating car. We approached the Millenium Stadium, and tried to break 
	into this also, but once again, we were rudely denied entry. Deeply upset, we headed into Cardiff City Centre to try and find something else to occupy ourselves. 
	<br><br>
	Here at NT, for a number of years now, we have had the idea of conducting a random walk along a train network, inspired by Matthew's professor Darren Crowdy in first 
	year, who came up with this exact example of randomly walking along the tube, deciding at each station what action should be taken, dependent on the outcome of flipping 
	an n-sided coin. We decided that the valleys were clearly the best place to do this, so we tried to find a shop that sold dice, as we do not know where Professor Crowdy 
	sources his illegal n-sided coins. Eventually, by dumb luck, we found some in The Works, and so we were soon equipped with all we needed to undertake our <s>D&D Quest</s> 
	NT Adventure!
	<br><br>
	We continued towards Queen Street, before turning towards one of the many dodgy Chinese takeaways we had previously tried to order from during R<sub>0</sub>=6. Here, 
	on our left, we saw the most wonderous sight - a multistorey car park! Immediately seized by a compulsion to enter, Matthew leapt over the wall and attempted to break in, 
	but alas, yet again to no avail. Even walking to the end of the dodgy CCTV camera-filled side street and yanking on the fire exit door's handle yielded no results. 
	Matthew was dragged away from the door by James and Ewan, and we turned the street corner to find a second door, this time an open one! Before they could blink, Matthew 
	had already entered and was racing up the stairs to the top.
	<br><br>
	It was a good multistorey car park. Nice view from the top. Nice electrical substation exposed to the elements. We loves a bit of that.
	<br><br>
	The car park even had a pedestrian entrance, leading into the top of the Capitol shopping centre. It looked very late-80s and very run-down - exactly the kind of places 
	we love in NT! We decided to race to the bottom - Ewan and James in the lift, and Matthew down the stairs. Matthew threw himself down the stairs, almost falling twice, 
	all the way to victory! After this, we did one last loop around Cardiff, before entering Cardiff Queen St and waiting for our train. Here, James and Ewan independently 
	pointed out all the places within Queen St that Matthew had <br>
	a) Ignored 'No Entry' signs and broken into, <br>
	b) Ignored 'No Running' signs and almost knocked people over, <br>
	c) Teleported through the station and abandoned James/Ewan, <br>
	and d) Turned up on the wrong platform and almost boarded the wrong train (again)<br>
	This time, however, Matthew only ignored a few signs, and we turned up on the correct platform, awaiting our Merthyr train. We decided to film the introductory 
	segment for our video here, explaining how our random walk through the tube was going to work. James then threw the dice onto the platform, in the direction of the 
	tracks (and an oncoming train), and both dice almost tumbled onto the rails below. What a great start! We picked up the dice, and they informed us of our next plan 
	of action... but Matthew didn't like that, so we ignored it and decided to go to Nantgarw instead.
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Nantgarw.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	Nantgarw is a beautiful station. A slab of desolate concrete, with no amenities whatsoever, between the 2 tracks, accessible only from a dodgy tunnel down an overgrown 
	backstreet, in the back of an abandoned industrial estate. Ah, what sweet memories. Matthew and Ewan had been here before during Aleph 8, but this was James' first time, 
	and he was very impressed indeed. We wandered through the industrial estate, and down the main road, discussing our recent Koppa 8 "James abandons Matthew" challenge, and 
	how it would be great to generalise this to the entire country. Needless to say, we are going to die.
	<br><br>
	We passed the amusingly-named Oxford Street, before reaching a giant wheel positioned on the pavement, next to a roundabout. Sounds like an opportunity for James to 
	explain exactly what this giant wheel was! (Disclaimer: so-called experts may disagree with James' facts here, but they are all fake news media, all of them).
	<br><br>
	Then, we reached Coleg Y Cwmoedd, just like last time. Matthew and Ewan once again walked exactly in step, but this time there was no car to simulataneously thank for 
	not running them over. Sad. But just like before, we simply waltzed straight into the college, with no-one batting an eyelid. Sekurity. We had a nice explore here - 
	up and down staircases, in and out of corridors, up and down the entire length of the building. Unfortunately, the friendly catering staff didn't let us in to explore 
	the kitchens this time, which would have been *chefs kiss*. Furthermore, the eighth wonder of the world, Nantgarw's functioning water fountain, functioned no more. It was 
	even more dead than the ones in Neath College. Matthew expressed his displeasure by breaking it further and twisting the tap by π/2 radians. We were unable to locate the 
	exact room where we'd had our MAT sessions during Aleph 8, and neither did we find the fancy restaurant that the college has, so we exited via the emergency exit behind 
	the back of the theatre, feeling very smug that we'd broken in, and already started to plan a fake MAT session if we ever go back.
	<br><br>
	Yet another reason we had been jealous of Coleg Y Cwmoedd at the time was that right behind the college was every restaurant you could think of - that was way better 
	than having to walk into town for Greggs! Well now that we didn't have college to go back to, they couldn't keep this all to themselves! We were going to show that we 
	could waltz into their Nandos for lunch too! So we did. It was nice, much better than the first one we'd tried. Once again, here, we rolled the dice to decide our next 
	move, before Matthew overruled that again.
	<br><br>
	Content that we had shared the joys of Coleg Y Cwmoedd with James, we now left Nantgarw, and to complete the Aleph 8 experience, we decided to walk to Taffs Well.<br>
	<strong>James: Is it a long walk?<br>
	Ewan: Not at all<br>
	Matthew: It's a 5 minute walk<br>
	James: For fuck sake</strong>
	<br><br>
	We down the forest trail, all the way to Taffs Well. It took us about 15 minutes to reach the rugby club at the edge of town, where we stumbled across some blackberry 
	bushes. It had now been about 0.3 seconds since James had last had food, and so he started grabbing handfuls of them and shoving them into his mouth. Matthew and Ewan 
	stood there gobsmacked...
	<br><br>
	Welcome to the Sampi 7 Michelin Guide, where James will give you a tour of the blackberry bushes he found uppa valleys;
	Bush by Taffs Well rugby club: 4 stars
	James: <strong>"It's very nice. It's edible. It's tasty, it's nummy, it's yum. It's really yummy innit. What's wrong with blackberries?"</strong>
	<br><br>
	Once James was fully dosed up on chemicals and cwac, we continued onwards, into Taffs Well itself. Here, however, we became slightly lost, and ended up wandering down 
	the backstreets and alleyways of the town. We wandered down a narrow barbed-wire enclosed path next to the tracks, all in the blazing sunshine, and walked up and down 
	the residential streets in this random town. We saw some NHS graffiti, right next to a pile of discarded treasure, including a smashed TV and a bathtub. We at NT know 
	where we will be doing our shopping this Christmas! After this, Matthew ventured deep into an overgrown backalley, and James and Ewan were just about to phone the coroner, 
	when Matthew teleported around the street out of houses and appeared in front of them in the street. As we approached the station, we saw some rotting fruit in the street, 
	and had to restrain James from snacking on the drain apples. Nommy.
	<br><br>
	Taffs Well station was kitted out with all the latest amenities - a smartcard reader!<br>
	...just a smartcard reader. There was literally fuck all else there. There was a seat falling to bits, and a crappy old dot matrix. No ticket barrier, no ticket 
	machine, and not even a bin bag. But a smartcard reader - TfW have their priorities straight!
	<br><br>
	The end of the platform at Taffs Well was far more interesting... because it didn't exist yet. It just ended, and was replaced by a number of shaky-looking columns, 
	allegedly strong enough to hold up a future extension of the platform. Definitely. Definitely not going to collapse the moment Sharon returns from her night out 
	"downs 'a 'Diff" and steps onto the 'platform'. There was also an amusing sign at this end of the platform, warning of certain death if you continued onto Nantgarw 
	(and no, I am not making this up, despite how perfect it is!)
	<br><br>
	Our train arrived and we boarded, heading all the way up the line to Treherbert. Was this what the dice said? No. Was it what Matthew really wanted? Yes. We passed 
	all the way up the line, following the course we'd set during Sampi I, and had never returned to since. This was a very different journey to that first one. There was 
	sunlight, there was no rain or fog, we could see where we were going, we weren't on a pacer :(, we could hear ourselves think thanks to the lack of screaming, and 
	we knew what kind of desolation we were headed for this time - Treherbert, the only valley without a picture in our montage.
	<br><br>
	Walked through the 
	stream, ate blackberries, played on the bridge, had fish and chips and admired the mountains before returning to Cardiff and taking the train to Gilfach Fargoed. 
	Measured the platform and bought coffee in Morrisons, before getting locked in and legging it back. Then the train’s doors broke, so we walked to Pengam and bought 
	coffee in Aldi. The next train was also cancelled, so we caught the 3rd one back to Cardiff, and headed home. One of the best.
