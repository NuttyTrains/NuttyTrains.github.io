	It's back to the future: Uppa valleys yet again, to finish what we started 2 years ago, featuring a very special guest! We break into a sixth form college, 
	run down a river screaming, and get abandoned for 2 hours in the dark whilst drinking 100 coffees!
	<br><br>
	<strong>
	The next train to arrive at PLATFORM DAI is the SAMPI 7 service to GILFACH FARGOED, calling at TREHERBERT, PONTYPRIDD OFF-LICENCE, CAERPHILTHY CRACK-DEN and 
  	<a href="https://www.redbubble.com/i/shower-curtain/Pacer-Memorial-by-NuttyTrains/78376475.YH6LW">THE PACER MEMORIAL<sup>TM</sup></a>. 
  	PLATFORM DAI for the SAMPI 7 service to GILFACH FARGOED.

	Matthew screamed into the train station, meeting Ewan and James on the train, and we headed to Cardiff. Tried to enter the BBC, Stadium and multistorey car park, 
	before buying dice and heading to Nantgarw. Broke into Coleg Y Cwmoedd and had Nandos, before walking to Taffs Well and heading to Treherbert. Walked through the 
	stream, ate blackberries, played on the bridge, had fish and chips and admired the mountains before returning to Cardiff and taking the train to Gilfach Fargoed. 
	Measured the platform and bought coffee in Morrisons, before getting locked in and legging it back. Then the trainâ€™s doors broke, so we walked to Pengam and bought 
	coffee in Aldi. The next train was also cancelled, so we caught the 3rd one back to Cardiff, and headed home. One of the best.
