	<b> Having visited seemingly every supermarket rail terminus in South Wales, and standing in the middle of a road, 
	screaming, "Run me over, 'en!", it was time for Matthew and James to admit they had a problem.</b>
	<br><br>
	In Summer 2019, we decided it was high time to make one final trip up the valleys to tick off dozens of Valley line stations. 
	We set off early in the morning for once, and headed out towards Bridgend. When we arrived, we bought our Valley Ranger tickets 
	and set off up to Maesteg. The Maesteg valley was a classic valley line, complete with steep sides, terraced houses, and even a 
	supermarket terminus. We pulled up into Asda car park, and dutifully renamed the station "Maesteg Asda Station", which was 
	fitting, seeing as Maesteg has 2 stations, and they needed to be differentiated. The only thing that could have improved this 
	first leg was if we'd had a pacer.

	We then headed back down the short valley to Bridgend, and continued on the line through the Vale of Glamorgan. For once, 
	we were on a serene, quiet valley line, with no dilapidation in sight! We were able to sit back in the long gaps between 
	stations and enjoy the view. This soon changed when we arrived in Barry. We alighted at the large station, admired the amazing 
	GWR benches painted in Arriva Blue, and waited for our service to Barry Island. Fortunately, the levels of desolation and 
	desperation that had characterised Valley Line trips so far were about to return, and return with a vengence. 
	<br><br>
	The train arrived, and as we got on, we were surrounded by genuine holidaymakers, to our absolute surprise and bewilderment. We 
	questioned how anyone could possibly want to holiday in Barry Island. As we drew nearer, James was shocked by the acres of empty 
	car parks and the abandoned theme park. His mum had warned him not to come here. Nevertheless, we pulled up in the station, now 
	in the pouring rain and gale force wind, and were abandoned in Barry Island - desolation unlike anything we'd ever seen before. 
	We went past the abandoned theme park, and reached the embankment. The wind was nearly hurricane strength now, and we had to 
	lean into the wind, with our hoods scrunched over our faces, just to be able to stand. Some elderly women were less lucky. 
	<br><br>
	Despite the terrible conditions, people were still selling ice cream, to our great amusement. We approached the line of shops, 
	and noticed that every other shop was either an arcade or a casino. We entered the largest arcade for shelter, and witnessed 
	possibly the saddest image to sum up NT&#993;: half the rides in the arcade were broken, and the other half were not functioning. 
	The floor was covered with mouldy, decomposing carpet tiles in places, bin bags in others, corrugated iron in one area, and the 
	last section had no floor at all - it was literally built on dirt. The floor was uneven and bumpy, with a massive hill in the 
	middle! What madness was this? The roof was leaking water in numerous places, sometimes into buckets, sometimes onto old rides, 
	and sometimes onto the exposed electrical cabling. The doors towards the back were sheet metal, which had been broken through 
	with blow torches, and the windows all around had been smashed by bricks. This was a sight unlike any other, no matter which 
	valley we went to. Feeling thoroughly shocked that our masochism had reached new depths, we fled, out into the rain again. 
	<br><br>
	We headed back to the station, passing a statue of a roman soldier... in Barry Island... in a theme park. What was going on? 
	Finally, we reached the station, only to be 2 minutes late, trapping us there for 13 more minutes. We bided our time in the 
	station cafe before escaping at last.
	<br><br>
	We headed north, away from the horror show of Barry Island and the elderly valley women on their annual exotic holiday, towards 
	Cardiff. Weirdly, James met his maths teacher from Cornwall on this journey. Before reaching Cardiff, we alighted at Grangetown 
	IKEA station, and walked to IKEA for lunch, which was very enjoyable. As we sat in IKEA, we took a break, and planned the rest 
	of our journey. Follwing some minor food shopping, we set off... away from Cardiff, back south to Penarth. Passing the 
	amazingly-named Dingle road, the poor train climbed relentlessly, clinging to the side of the mountain, squeezed behind rows of 
	houses. We reached Penarth, ticked off another spur, and headed to Cardiff at last.
	<br><br> 
	Here, we spotted the All The Stations Flag flying above the station, bought the obligatory packets of salt and vinegar crisps, 
	and ticked off Cardiff Central, because we may or many not have messed up and forgotten to tick it off in the past. After that, 
	we headed north once more, to our final central Valley line, Aberdare!
	<br><br>
	We had heard many stories about Aberdare from one of our friends in school, so we were expecting the worst. On the way up, we 
	followed the track of the Merthyr line, reminding us of &#993;1. We then diverged at Penrhiwceiber, and James had great fun 
	mangling the Welsh pronounciations. Finally, we arrived at our terminus, which disappointingly, was not in a supermarket car 
	park. Fearing that NT was losing its nuttiness, we walked down to the main road, stood in the middle, and screamed, "Run me 
	over, 'en!" to the cars, who took this as a challenge. It was now time for Matthew and James to admit they had a problem. 
	Finally, we took our terminus sign photo, and what an amazing photo it is:

	Eating our crisps on the way down, we then planned our final leg of the journey, to try and crack the Cardiff City line, an 
	incomplete ring around the city which Matthew had had some bad experiences with in the past. It was decided that we would 
	disembark at Queen Street, head anticlockwise to the terminus (inadvertently recreating Matthew's failed previous attempt at the 
	line), before going clockwise all the way around to Radyr, our final station. Our journey on the way back down was... interesting. 
	For the first time in NT, we had encountered some trainspotters. James spent most of the journey gently arguing with him/her 
	(we disagreed here), and defending his knowledge of trains, his memory, and our previous adventures. He also unsuccessfully 
	tried to promote the Real-Time Trains app that he uses. After arguing gently for an hour, we disembarked from the most awkward 
	train trip in history, and vowed to never again interact with trainspotters -  that conversation had been a complete derailment.
	<br><br>
	We came to the conclusion that just like Geoff and Vicki, we are interested in the railways, the stations, the networks and the 
	places, not just the trains (although, when TfW goes around nabbing everyone else's trains, you have to pay attention to the 
	trains too!).
	<br><br>
	The city line went smoothly, as we ticked off the stations, and Matthew relived his PTSD. Finally, we arrived in Radyr, took a 
	photo, and explored the station. We then had a dilemna. 2 trains were scheduled to arrive at Radyr simultaneously. Which would 
	we choose? We sprinted back and forth between platforms in anticipation, almost killing James in the process. Then, a sprinter 
	turned up... on the wrong platform. But a rival appeared - a pacer on our platform. We eagerly awaited it, and jumped aboard! Both 
	trains started up, their pitiful bus engines on at maximum power, and their ill-fitting wheels screaming into life. Both began 
	to accelerate towards the station exit, but which would win? Would they collide? ...unfortunately not -  I am still alive. 
	Luckily, our pacer out-paced our rival sprinter, and we headed back to Cardiff, to await our train home. 
	<br><br>
	Whilst there, we laughed ourselves silly at our concept of pacer races, but laughed even harder when we witnessed the awful mess 
	TfW had made of repainting their fleet - they had different colour carriages coupled to one another, they had trains that they 
	hadn't been bothered to paint, so stuck a sticker on instead, and they even had Matthew's favourite train, the one they 
	accidentially painted a completely wrong colour - silver instead of white! (We know that this was a TfW cock-up, because there are 
	no trains in Britain which are deliberately painted silver and red). Finally, a class 43 HST turned up! What you do'in? Matthew 
	was gobsmacked that this supreme convocation of trains had all turned up at once. Sufficiently amused, Matthew and James headed 
	home after their longest ever NT journey.
