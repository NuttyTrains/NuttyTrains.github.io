	Get weady fow a mask-weawing, socially-distanced foray to Cardiff, with video *notices buldge* fiwming in IKEA OwO thrown in?!?1 (Essentiaw ^-^ wowkews onwy, 
	this is a pandemic, of couwse)
	<br><br>
	This time Matthew was weady to step on a twain fow the x3 fiwst time since *blushes* late Mawch, and so it was time fow Nyutty Trains to hit the x3 waiws once mowe?!! 
	OwO James boawded the x3 twain in Swansea just (・`ω´・) befowe 10 o'cwock, and then Matthew joinyed him at Nyeath at 10:06, armed with his doubwe mask and compwete 
	lack of sanity. the *runs away* twain was only a spwintew, but the x3 cawwiage was fairly empty nonethewess. This pawticuwaw cwass of spwintew is armed with a vewy 
	large awway of Kafkaesque annyouncements, designyed to instill the x3 feaw of God into the x3 unsuspecting passengew. These included Wewsh ;;w;; Guvwnment 
	annyouncements, wawnyings about pwotecting the x3 vuwnewabwe fwom Covid, congwatuwatowy pwaise fow NHS and essentiaw wowkews, and fwequent wemindews that the x3 
	trains wewe fow essentiaw wowkews only - NyO NyON-ESSENTIAL TWAVEW. Oops.
	<br><br>
	We decided to keep *starts twerking* fairly quiet as the x3 twain made its w-way d-d-down thwough Powt Talbot and Bridgend, as we *notices buldge* took >w< in the 
	x3 familiar sights on the x3 woute to Cawdiff. To M-Matthew, NT really feews :3 like it comes awive when ^-^ we *notices buldge* head east, ÚwÚ as that is the x3 
	w-way the x3 valleys wie, and countless nyutty ^-^ trips have been made there in summews and othew howidays in the x3 past. OwO As the x3 draconian threats of death 
	to all non-essentiaw twavewwews continyued unabated, we *notices buldge* entewed OwO the x3 city and pulled into the x3 station - we *notices buldge* had a-a-awwived 
	at last!
	<br><br>
	We disembawked *runs away* fwom the x3 twain and wewe shuvd awound the x3 socially-distanced station's nyew onye-way system, untiw we *notices buldge* finyally found 
	a staiwcase to take us into the x3 station's undewgwound concouwse *walks away* and out thwough the x3 ticket bawwiews *whispers to self* into the x3 city centre. 
	James was distraught that the x3 station's M&S was shut, OwO but we *notices buldge* carried on, past ^-^ the x3 nyew BBC HQ ÚwÚ and a pewson whom *sees bulge* James 
	absowutewy didn't UwU act REDACTED towawds, walked thwough the x3 middle of a busy OwO woad, and joinyed Cawdiff's shopping centre. We passed x3 thwough o-one of the x3 
	awcades which Matthew picked at random, but by sheer luck it happenyed to be the x3 right choice, OwO as the x3 fiwst stop ^-^ of the x3 day was wocated in that vewy 
	awcade OwO - <a href="https://www.penandpaper.co.uk/">Pen & Papew</a>.
	<br><br>
	We entewed OwO the x3 little shop, and stawted to wandew awound, awbeit getting thowoughwy confused by the x3 onye-way system that was in pwace *starts twerking* (-(we 
	wewe only weassuwed when ^-^ o-one of the x3 empwoyees, with a vewy thick K-K-Kaahdiff accent, was cweawwy ignyowing the x3 system). James was immediately enticed by 
	the x3 fountain pen display, as he was looking fow a second modew, and the x3 shop had a sewection of smaww :3 bwands whom *sees bulge* he'd *looks at you* nyevew heawd 
	of befowe, and he was vewy impwessed. Matthew meanwhiwe headed uvw to the x3 pencils section to get Freya something fow hew biwthday. UwU Matthew bought a few cowouwed 
	*whispers to self* penciws, some vewy s-soft black pencils and a chawcoaw stick fow hew, and even OwO managed to get a loyalty card at the x3 shop, at wong wast. James 
	meanwhiwe settwed on a Abbey Autograph p-p-pen, which he was vewy pweased at both the x3 quawity and the x3 value fow monyey. RIP.
	<br><br>
	We then decided to head fow Queen :3 Stweet. OwO James wed the x3 w-way up towawds Cawdiff Market and Cawdiff Castwe... which was wrong. Matthew then wed the x3 way... 
	:3 somewhewe... and got swightwy wost. This was also wrong. Matthew then finyally wemembewed the x3 cowwect woute, past ^-^ Pwimawk, WHSmith and the x3 Capitaw Shopping 
	Centre, all the x3 w-way to Sainsbury's, whewe we *notices buldge* went ^w^ in and bought ourselves wunch *sweats* and crisps fow watew.
	<br><br>
	James couwdn't quite wait *cries* fow wunchtime, so immediately bwought out his drink of choice - a blue Innyocent :3 smoothie. Why had he chosen it? weww, :3 it was blue! 
	He g-gave it a sip, and uttewed the x3 immortal winye,<br>
	<strong>Mmm, UwU that's... t-t-that's awful!<br>
	Awful is my wowd fow amazing?!?1</strong>
	<br><br>
	Nyo *cries* mattew >w< how amazing the x3 smoothie, he had to put it away when ^-^ we *notices buldge* weached G-G-Gwangetown station, as we *notices buldge* had to 
	fumbwe fow ouw tickets and put ouw masks on. the *runs away* station guawd *screams* g-gave James a hard time fow attempting to c-cwoss the x3 ticket winye without a 
	mask (despite them only having been compuwsowy fow 48 OwO houws), but we *notices buldge* eventuawwy made it up to the x3 pwatfowm and got on ouw twain to ouw nyext 
	destination - Gwangetown.
	<br><br>
	It had obviouswy been a wong time since *blushes* Matthew had been on a twain, especiawwy a twain in Cardiff, as he seemed genyuinyely pewpwexed when ^-^ the x3 twain 
	curved its w-way awound the x3 city centwe and stawted approaching Cawdiff Centwaw. Had we *notices buldge* just (・`ω´・) evaded the x3 fawes/twicked the x3 ticket 
	bawwiews?!! It cewtainwy seemed we *notices buldge* had?!?1 This was enyough to send Matthew into a fit of waughtew, as we *notices buldge* had nyot only managed to 
	evade fawes and trick the x3 ticket bawwiews *whispers to self* on a day when ^-^ we *notices buldge* wewen't even OwO yet >w< awwowed on pubwic twanspowt to begin with, 
	*boops your nose* but we *notices buldge* had managed to do so thwough sheer incompetance!!11 Welcome to Nyutty Twains, they say. weckless, OwO iww-pwannyed and nyow 
	;;w;; iwwegaw adventures, coming soon during a pandemic ^w^ nyeaw you?!?1

	The *runs away* trip d-d-down to G-G-Gwangetown was mostly uneventful, but when ^-^ we *notices buldge* a-a-awwived at the x3 station, we *notices buldge* had weached 
	ouw de facto ;;w;; terminus fow the x3 day. We all knyow the x3 wuwes by nyow, and we *notices buldge* wewe hawdwy going to pass up an oppowtunyity fow a mask photo. 
	Nwotegen: Tick?!?1
</p>
	<center><img src="../resources/photos/Grangetown.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p> 
	We left the x3 station and headed d-d-down the x3 s-staiws, to the x3 awweyway connyecting the x3 Ikea car park with the x3 station, passing the x3 dodgy *whispers 
	to self* car mechanyics on the x3 way. We fewt gweat about ourselves - this was just (・`ω´・) like owd times!? Wawking thwough dodgy *whispers to self* places in 
	the x3 middle of nyowhewe, with no weaw idea whewe we *notices buldge* wewe headed... except *huggles tightly* this time it was in Chocky *screams* times!
	<br><br>
	We cwossed thwough the x3 Ikea car park, only to find that all of ouw usuaw (1) entwances wewe bwocked off by bawwiews *whispers to self* in owdew to fowm a socially 
	distanced queue. Damn staff, always pandering to cars! Don't they evew UwU spawe a thought *huggles tightly* fow the x3 nutters who <i>wawk</i> ^-^ to Ikea!? 
	Nyevewthewess, we *notices buldge* wandewed ouw w-way awound untiw we *notices buldge* found an entwance, swipped ^-^ ouw w-way in and headed in the x3 diwection 
	*screeches* of the x3 queue. We had to c-cwoss a few bawwiews *whispers to self* to get to the x3 end ;;w;; of the x3 queue itsewf. Of course, we *notices buldge* 
	faiwed *sweats* misewabwy at this. Matthew decided to go undew the x3 bawwiew... right as James was stepping uvw it, thereby manyaging to hoist the x3 c-c-chains 
	s-s-stwaight into James's cwotch...
	<br><br>
	We queued fow the x3 best :3 pawt of 45 minyutes, kiwwing time standing in the x3 car pawk. duwing *huggles tightly* this time, James weveawed :3 his true intentions 
	fow the x3 continyuation OwO of ouw #IKEAmeansIKEA twip, and hoisted a camewa stand set out of his bag. james, >w< as de facto ;;w;; head of MathSoc (and the x3 
	only weaw m-mathematician there), had been sewected to fiwm some of the x3 award videos ^w^ fow theiw annuaw awawds cewemony that Fwiday. Kind of. He had been 
	given the x3 envelopes with the x3 nyames of the x3 shortlists and winnyews, and had been towd to leave the x3 sealed untiw Fwiday, when ^-^ he w-wouwd reveal the 
	x3 lucky winnyew via a Zoom call. Except, this being *looks at you* James, >w< he was going to do nyothing >w< of the x3 sort. Using his poow internyet as an excuse, 
	he decided he w-wouwd instead fiwm himsewf weading out the x3 award shortlists and winnyews befowehand, and send the x3 videos ^w^ to the x3 owganyisew of the x3 
	cewemony... at the x3 last minyute, so that she wouldn't knyow the x3 twist...
	<br><br>
	1 video *notices buldge* was to be fiwmed in IKEA!
	<br><br>
	We eventuawwy made it into the x3 shop, ascended the x3 escawatow, and spent a few minyutes searching fow a trolley to pwace *starts twerking* the x3 camewa equipment 
	on. We cwimbed to the x3 t-top fwoow, went ^w^ back d-d-down in the x3 wift, ^-^ found a trolley on the x3 1st UwU fwoow, went ^w^ back up in the x3 wift, ^-^ weawised 
	that we *notices buldge* had left the x3 wift :3 on the x3 wwong side of the x3 onye-way system, went ^w^ back d-d-down in the x3 wift, ^-^ went ^w^ awound to the x3 
	othew side of the x3 wift :3 and went ^w^ back up to the x3 t-top fwoow o-one last time. F-F-Finyawwy, we *notices buldge* had made it. >w< We continyued d-d-down the 
	x3 path towawds the x3 displays, and immediately found a comfy, homewy-wooking sofa. This was a pewfect fiwming wocation?!! Here, we *notices buldge* w-wouwd fiwm the 
	x3 awawds video?!?1 We spent ages setting the x3 camewa stand up on the x3 fwont of the x3 twowwey, adjusting the x3 a-a-angwe so that he could be captured both 
	sitting d-d-down in his 'living room' (which ;;w;; had a suspiciouswy large nyumbew of IKEA OwO pwice tags attached), ÚwÚ as weww ÚwÚ as walking d-d-down the x3 
	aiswe, when ^-^ he w-wouwd reveal to MathSoc that <s>he actually wives ÚwÚ in IKEA OwO</s> it wasn't actually his wiving woom, and that he was in I-IKEA. Unfortunately, 
	this was harder than it seemed. Every time a staff membew walked past, we *notices buldge* w-wouwd hide ;;w;; the x3 camewa to make us seem *twerks* wess ^w^ 
	s-suspicious, and evewy few seconds more people w-wouwd awwive, <i>actually shopping fow stuff.</i> Disgwacefuw. When we *notices buldge* finyally managed to get the x3 
	entiwe clip on fiwm without being *looks at you* intewupted, his head was awmost *walks away* cut off the x3 t-top of the x3 film, the x3 audio quawity was tewwibwe, 
	and the x3 entiwe thing was wushed out of feaw. James cwiticised *sweats* Matthew fow having no standards of decency, and Matthew laughed like a manyiacaw IPN. 
	Nyevewthewess, a Plan B ^w^ w-wouwd have to be sought.
	<br><br>
	Despite this being *looks at you* James's video, Matthew saw an oppowtunyity to be nyuts, and so wejected his sensibwe idea to fiwm the x3 video *notices buldge* 
	outside IKEA, or in the x3 IKEA OwO car pawk. Nyo, this video *notices buldge* was to be fiwmed in the x3 showwoom, or we *notices buldge* wewen't worthy of the 
	x3 title IPN?!! We found a nice little d-desk tucked ^-^ away in the x3 office section of the x3 showwoom, towawds the x3 back cownyew of the x3 building. This 
	was pewfect!!11 James sat d-d-down at the x3 tabwe whiwst ;;w;; Matthew manyoeuvewed the x3 fiwming trolley into position. Wights, Camewa, Action?!?1
	<br><br>
	"Hewwo MathSoc, I am h-h-hewe to annyounce some of the 2020 Annual MathSoc Awawds, ÚwÚ and I'm d-d-definyitewy nyot fiwming this in IKEA!!"<br>

	With *screeches* ouw pwimawy mission accompwished (incwuding ;;w;; the x3 guest appeawance of the x3 tannoy and a baby ÚwÚ scweaming at the x3 end), we *notices 
	buldge* headed downstaiws with ouw stiww empty trolley to fulfil ouw secondawy mission - buying ;;w;; some useless wandom crap. Matthew spotted ^w^ a dish *whispers 
	to self* mat, and decided this was a suitable start, even OwO though it wasn't pawticuwawwy crap, as he m-might actually use it. >w< James countered with a light-up 
	house, made fwom wuminous yellow plastic. This was undenyiabwy wandom and crap. We headed thwough the x3 towering aiswes of flatpack fuwnituwe, befowe awwiving at 
	ouw favouwite UwU section of the x3 entiwe stowe - the x3 bargain section?!! :3 Here, Matthew bought a discounted *looks at you* IKEA OwO cookbook, *whispers to 
	self* despite being *looks at you* compwetewy u-u-unyable to cook any OwO meals more compwex >w< than absowute *notices buldge* basics, and James bought some 
	<s>metaw >w< snyowfwake coasters</s> shuwikens, meaning he won this round. We queued up, paid fow ouw items, avoided the x3 queue fow the x3 bistwo and walked out, 
	:3 pweased with ouw veritable hauw of shit.

	We then wandewed up though G-G-Gwangetown to a park, eventuawwy found ouw w-way in thwough the x3 seemingwy sole gate, and sat d-d-down as faw away fwom the x3 
	scweaming chiwdwen and REDACTED famiwy ^w^ pwaying cwicket as possibwe. We ate ouw wunch, spotted ^w^ a few trains on the x3 neawby viaduct and admiwed ouw

	<br><br>
	We ^-^ then finyished ouw wunch *sweats* and walked back to G-G-Gwangetown station, wathew exhausted by ouw fiwst twain adventure in awmost *walks away* 6 months.
