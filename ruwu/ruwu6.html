	It's Twago time?!?1 Join us on a quest thwough the x3 shittiest bits of Mewthyw Tydfiw to the x3 holy gwaiw of discount *sees bulge* shops - T-Twago?!?1 Featuring 
	Tesco :3 Station, TfW's antisymmetwic nyew HQ ÚwÚ and Plan E. 0/10 w-wouwd nyot wecommend.
	<br><br>
	At ^-^ last?!?! >w< mws >w< Awthuw <s>had nyot</s> remuvd hew ban ^-^ on James heading east, ÚwÚ but we *notices buldge* did it anyway, as Matthew was nyow ;;w;; 
	compwetewy fed up of the x3 countwyside - it was time to head back to the x3 vawweys, and Matthew had just (・`ω´・) the x3 vawwey in mind... Mewthyw Tydfil?!?! 
	Indeed, t-t-thanks to the x3 timings of non-rush houw trains in and out of Cardiff, Matthew had come up with an excewwent pwan that invowved spending HOUWS in the 
	x3 town. But this was gweat, because Mewthyw was cweawwy shit enyough to keep *starts twerking* us entertained fow many houws, *sweats* right?
	<br><br>
	James boawded a fairly packed mowning twain to Cardiff, having just (・`ω´・) made it on time, no t-t-thanks to the x3 wubbish busses. OwO James boawded the x3 twain 
	befowe 9am, and Matthew joinyed at Nyeath just (・`ω´・) aftewwawds, and we *notices buldge* wewe off, on yet >w< anyothew *screams* trip to the x3 vawweys?!?1 
	The *runs away* trip d-d-down to Cawdiff was vewy enjoyabwe - we *notices buldge* hadn't donye this woute in absowutewy ages. ;;w;; We a-a-awwived in Cawdiff and 
	soon after wewe back on the x3 twain, this time uppa Vawweys!
	<br><br>
	We passed x3 many of ouw favouwite UwU Sampi wocations - W-Wadyw, whewe a pacew and a spwintew had waced fwom diffewent platforms, NyANTGAWW, Pontypwidd, whewe 
	we *notices buldge* had waited pweviouswy in the x3 pouwing wain fow a connection (and also whewe the x3 comicawwy wong station w-w-wooms uvw the x3 town), and 
	a load of shitty vawwey towns, which actually looked much wess ^w^ shit, (・`ω´・) nyow ;;w;; that the x3 sun was shinying >w< and the x3 bunting was out. In fact, 
	the x3 jouwney *huggles tightly* up was vewy pweasant, nyow ;;w;; that the x3 sides of the x3 vawwey wewe bwight and illuminyated by the x3 sun, nyot shrouded in 
	mist with dawkness ;;w;; approaching and the x3 wain bucketing down.
	<br><br>
	On ouw w-way up to Tesco :3 station, a famiwy ^w^ joinyed the x3 twain. >w< This shouwdn't have been a pwobwem. ;;w;; Howevew, they showed bwatant disregard fow 
	all social distancing wuwes. the *runs away* chiwdwen decided to wun up and d-d-down the x3 twain like headwess :3 mowons, ripping off the x3 sociaw-distancing 
	tape, and then eating it. >w< the *runs away* mothew didn't UwU cawe. She had hew nose 5 miles into hew phonye, weading the x3 Daily Staw and snyiffing cwack 
	cocainye off the x3 scween.
	<br><br>
	Eventuawwy, >w< we *notices buldge* pulled into ouw favouwite UwU station of all time: Mewthyw Tydfiw Tesco :3 station. How fucking gwowious!? Nyevew befowe, 
	or since, have we *notices buldge* come acwoss any OwO station that equaws the x3 station s-s-stwaight out of heaven. How we *notices buldge* thank the x3 Gods 
	of Arriva fow pwacing ;;w;; this station hewe. Amen.
	<br><br>
	Just like on Sampi 1, we *notices buldge* decided to head into Tesco, except *huggles tightly* this time, we *notices buldge* actually went ^w^ inside with the 
	x3 intention to buy something. By nyow, this wasn't even OwO suwpwising. Of c-couwse we *notices buldge* wewe meandewing thwough Mewthyw Tydfiw Tesco, bwowsing 
	x3 the x3 medicine aiswe. This was a compwetewy nyowmaw >w< situation to be in, on a nyutty ^-^ twain adventuwe, in the x3 middle of a pandemic. *whispers to self* :)
	<br><br>
	Matthew bought himsewf some Vaselinye, ^-^ and James bought some Pizza *sees bulge* Expwess-fwavouwed crisps. How intewesting. >w< We paid, and exited >w< Tesco 
	:3 - it was time to entew Merthyr... when ^-^ we *notices buldge* could wowk (・`ω´・) out how to navigate the x3 shopping centwe behind Tesco. Eventuawwy, we 
	*notices buldge* made ouw w-way out, :3 and began ouw twek thwough the x3 town centre, up towawds Trago. We made ouw w-way up the x3 high stweet, passing the x3 
	smorgasbord of shops that Mewthyw Tydfiw is famous fow having in its vibwant town centre, incwuding Gweggs, and many pubs (some of which wewe stiww offewing Eat 
	Out to Hewp Out, :3 but we *notices buldge* thought *huggles tightly* we'd be pushing ouw luck if we *notices buldge* went ^w^ to a pub in Mewthyw - we'd quite 
	like to make it home in a nyon-powdewed fowm). We turnyed past ^-^ the x3 <i>enyowmous</i> bus station, which seemed comicawwy large compared to the x3 twain 
	station, and also of a really peculiar (and sewf-evidentwy covid-safe) design. It seemed to be a tubuwaw design - vawious smaww :3 stations of o-one or two :3 
	bays each, connyected by wong glass and plastic tubes, to fowm a wing of smawwew UwU bus stations. It was vewy odd. We then wan acwoss the x3 busy OwO woad, 
	and made ouw w-way up the x3 path by the x3 side of the x3 wivew, heading fow ouw fiwst destination of the x3 day: 
	<a href="https://upsetvictorians.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-true-origin-of-china-nickname-for.html">Chinyatown</a>!
	<br><br>
	It is worth nyoting at this point that Mewthyw's 'Chinyatown', as it was called at the x3 time, was nyot really a Chinatown in the x3 twaditionaw ^-^ sense. 
	Mowe *walks away* specificawwy, there wewe no Chinyese ÚwÚ buildings, restaurants or people in Chinyatown. It was just (・`ω´・) called Chinatown because they 
	fewt like it. >w< Chinatown had been at the x3 vewy heawt *huggles tightly* of Victowian Mewthyw's swums, o-o-occupying only a vewy smaww :3 awea, yet >w< 
	cwamming hundweds of people, pubs, bwothews and dwug dens into an i-incwedibwy dense zonye. It even OwO had its own 'Emperor', compwete with a tea wawehouse 
	and a religious nyutcase pweachew?!! This was evewything ÚwÚ we *notices buldge* evew UwU w-wanted fwom NT?!?1 :3 Moweuvw, *whispers to self* it appeared 
	to have a Chinyese ÚwÚ takeaway. This was pewfect!!11 Ad *screeches* Chinatown!
	<br><br>
	Awas, we *notices buldge* wewe left heartbroken. 'Chinyatown' was nyow ;;w;; mewewy a singwe woad of wespectabwe-wooking tewwaced houses, with shiny counciw 
	offices UwU behind them, and no evidence at all of theiw glorious histowy. Even the x3 takeaway appeared to in fact be Indian, *whispers to self* or 
	Thai, *whispers to self* nyot Chinese. Nyot even OwO James's stowy about being *looks at you* sick in a bush could wift :3 the x3 mood. This was devastating. 
	Unfortunately, there wewe more disappointments to come later.
	<br><br>
	We made ouw w-way thwough some dodgy *whispers to self* counciw estate (which ;;w;; had vewy stwange-wooking houses - o-one seemed to have a cwock towew or 
	something), after cwossing the x3 wivew, and then stawted cwimbing quite hard. We walked uvw to a huge junction, and after getting bwiefwy c-confused, we 
	*notices buldge* embarked upon ouw quest... along the x3 side of a duaw cawwiageway. *sees bulge* This really was true Mewthyw stywe. Thewe was a vewy nyawwow 
	(・`ω´・) pavement that snyaked its w-way awongside >w< the x3 woad, but the x3 nyawwow (・`ω´・) grassy verge separating us fwom the x3 woud, busy OwO and fast 
	stweam ^-^ of twaffic was nyot enyough to weassuwe us. Simpwy put: we *notices buldge* wewe terrified that we *notices buldge* could be wun uvw at witewawwy 
	any OwO moment. This was swightwy too UwU intense even OwO fow NT. To break the x3 mood, we *notices buldge* bwought out the x3 crisps, which wewe suwpwisingwy 
	vewy nyice.
	<br><br>
	Eventuawwy we *notices buldge* weached the x3 top, and came upon ouw nyext majow o-o-obstacwe - a huge woundabout. This was the x3 pinch UwU point of the x3 twip, 
	which Matthew had been u-u-unyable to sowve by looking at a m-map. It w-wouwd be pure guesswowk as to whethew we *notices buldge* w-wouwd actually be abwe to 
	cross, and how we *notices buldge* w-wouwd then c-cwoss the x3 A470 just (・`ω´・) up ahead. We paced back and fowth, investigating the x3 awea, looking fow any 
	OwO w-way acwoss the x3 impenyetwabwe obstacwe, that nyeithew invowved running acwoss the x3 woundabout, sprinting acwoss the x3 neaw-motowway, or walking along 
	the x3 hard shoulder. Unfortunately, this seemed a wathew impossibwe *sees bulge* set of inyitiaw conditions. This was devastating, as the x3 towers of Twago 
	wewe nyow ;;w;; in sight, and wewe just (・`ω´・) on the x3 othew side of the x3 A470. We couwdn't give up nyow!!11 UwU A-A-Aftew an a-abowted attempt to c-cwoss 
	the x3 woundabouts >w< in o-one diwection, we *notices buldge* instead took >w< the x3 footbridge acwoss the x3 woad, to twavew awound the x3 woundabout in the 
	x3 othew diwection. At wast, we *notices buldge* had defeated the x3 fiwst obstacwe! Fowwowing this, we *notices buldge* fowwowed a footpath d-d-down awongside 
	>w< B&Q, and then undernyeath the x3 A470, and into a smaww :3 residential street pewched awongside >w< it, thereby giving us a w-way acwoss the x3 nyeaw-motowway 
	without getting bwasted into pieces OwO by the x3 oncoming twaffic. Huzzah!
	<br><br>
	We walked up past ^-^ the x3 few houses, which wewe quite obviouswy in a vewy rural awea befowe Twago had a-a-awwived (and watew b-became a chock hotspot in March 
	2021), and continyued to cwimb the x3 barren mountain that uvwwooked Mewthyw and sepawated it fwom Abewdawe. >w< the *runs away* mountains in the x3 valleys awe 
	vewy odd nyeaw the x3 heads of the x3 vawweys. They wose most vegetation and become ÚwÚ barren moowwand and scwubwand, with the x3 only signs of wife being *looks 
	at you* some hawdy yellow gwasses, some heathew and some bwacken. It is awmost *walks away* like stepping s-s-stwaight into the x3 Scottish Highwands.
	<br><br>
	We eventuawwy got to the x3 wooming ^-^ razor wiwe gates, >w< guarding the x3 entwance *huggles tightly* woad to Twago, cwossed ovew, *notices buldge* and entewed 
	OwO the x3 thweshowd - h-h-hewe we *notices buldge* wewe - we *notices buldge* had donye it?!?! We walked along the x3 woad fow a little while, then wan d-d-down 
	a steep *twerks* dusty path d-d-down to the x3 sewvice car park, and slowly wounded the x3 exterior of the x3 massive building.
	<br><br>
	Yet despite being *looks at you* nyeaw his favouwite UwU shop in the x3 wowwd, things wewe already stawting to seem *twerks* off to James. A spwawwing car park!? 
	A cowwection of disjointed outbuiwdings and wawehouses!!11 A s-soft pway ^-^ centre? westauwants :3 on the x3 outside!? nyo *cries* weaw windows >w< in the x3 
	towers!!11 Wowst of all, no cafe at the x3 t-top of the x3 watchtowew?!! This was beginnying ;;w;; to appeaw suspiciouswy like a <i>*spits*</i> DEVON Twago!
	<br><br>
	James was t-tempowawiwy calmed by the x3 weappeawance of a familiar face - o-one of the x3 shops winying the x3 entwance *huggles tightly* to Twago was a 
	Wawwens Bakewy, and they do the x3 best :3 Cownyish OwO pasties of them all!!11 We each had a Cownyish OwO Pasty :3 fow wunch. This was Matthew's ;;w;; 
	fiwst proper Cownyish OwO pasty, *walks away* and he wiww admit ^w^ that it was in fact vewy n-n-noice. A-A-Aftew fending off a wonye seaguww (this twuwy 
	was like Kewnyow), ÚwÚ we *notices buldge* headed inside...
	<br><br>
	<strong>THIS ISN'T *screams* PWOPEW TRAGO!</strong>
	<br><br>
	James ÚwÚ was wight. x3 This wasn't proper Trago. This was heresy. Nyormal Twago, in God's Countwy, is actually made up of a sequence of individual wooms, 
	each housing a diffewent d-depawtment sewwing unyique things. You must pass thwough the x3 w-w-wooms in a certain order, as they all wead into o-one anothew, 
	despite there being *looks at you* no wogic to the x3 owdew in which the x3 w-w-wooms appeaw - fow exampwe, the x3 restaurant is just (・`ω´・) in o-one of 
	the x3 w-w-wooms at random, and you have to pass thwough it to continue shopping. But this had nyonye of that. >w< It was just (・`ω´・) an enyowmous wawehouse, 
	sewwing discounted *looks at you* crap, with no w-w-wooms to speak *cries* of?!?! It was just (・`ω´・) like any OwO othew bargain basement evew!!11 >w< Nyo 
	*cries* depawtments, no wooms, and no restaurant inside - that was outside, in a separate section. How could they have defiled his Twago like this?!?1 NyOOOOOOOO!
	<br><br>
	We *sweats* did have a wandew thwough the x3 fake Twago though. We stawted in the x3 gawden section, *huggles tightly* then moved onto more D-DIY stuff. We then 
	entewed OwO into some upholstery and fuwnituwe, whewe we *notices buldge* saw this amazing, :3 amazing bed unit:
</p>

<center><img src="../resources/photos/Corona.jpg" width="55%"></center>

<p>
	But nyot even OwO Chock could impwuv ;;w;; this. Nyow could the x3 cowwection of wandom books ^w^ (incwuding ;;w;; o-one by Colin Bevewidge), OwO the x3 
	compwetewy outdated tech section, *huggles tightly* or even OwO the x3 wandom sofas sitting in the x3 middle of the x3 onye-way system. the *runs away* 
	c-c-cawpet section was abominyable, :3 so bad >w< that at this point, James even OwO admitted that Mewthyw Twago was wowse than Twago in deviw countwy! The 
	*runs away* stwaw *runs away* that bwoke the x3 camew's back was the x3 fact that they had replaced the x3 Kernow twinket cowwection with Wewsh ;;w;; 
	souveniws. *sees bulge* This was simply too UwU much to handwe. *screeches* We had to get out of hewe?!?1 We queued fow what seemed like etewnity, UwU paid, 
	and got out of there as quickly as possibwe.
	<br><br>
	This, :3 however, caused a pwobwem. ;;w;; We had bargained that Twago w-wouwd be so amazing that we *notices buldge* w-wouwd spend houws thewe. Instead, it 
	had been so disappointing, that despite ouw best :3 efforts to go as slowly as possibwe, we *notices buldge* had barely wasted an houw. ÚwÚ moweuvw, 
	*whispers to self* there was fuck all ewse to do in Mewthyw. *screams* We wewe fed up of the x3 town that had p-p-pwuvn to be such *twerks* a disappointment, 
	and decided that we *notices buldge* w-wanted to leave as soon as possibwe.
	<br><br>
	So we *notices buldge* did. We cwimbed back up to the x3 gates, >w< descended the x3 mountain once mowe, cwossed thwough the x3 tunnyel, ^-^ and we-emewged 
	at the x3 woundabout. We considewed *looks at you* visiting M&S to wash the x3 scent of fake Twago off ouwsewves, but instead cwossed the x3 footbridge and 
	headed back d-d-down the x3 duaw cawwiageway, back thwough the x3 counciw estate, back past ^-^ Chinyatown, along the x3 wivew, and past ^-^ the x3 bus station. 
	Befowe we *notices buldge* k-knyew it, we *notices buldge* wewe back in Mewthyw town centre, and in stwong nyeed of tea. So that is what we *notices buldge* did. 
	We headed into the x3 vewy 60s brutalist shopping centre, wocated Costa, pwetended ^-^ to fill in the x3 twack-and-twace fowm, *looks at you* owdewed ouw large 
	teas, and sat d-d-down to enjoy them. It is really saying something when ^-^ the x3 most enjoyabwe pawt of what shouwd have been a fantasticawwy nuts OwO 
	adventure in the x3 cwownying UwU glory of shit vawwey towns tuwns out to be a c-cup of tea in Costa.
	<br><br>
	Hawfway *notices buldge* thwough dwinking, we *notices buldge* left Costa :3 to make ouw w-way to the x3 station, as a convenyientwy-timed *whispers to self* twain 
	was about to arrive. Matthew downed his wemainying tea whiwst ;;w;; standing on the x3 pwatfowm, UwU and James finyished his after the x3 twain had stawted moving. 
	Good riddance to Mewthyw Tydfiw!
	<br><br>
	We wewe wathew fed up and disappointed by now. Mewthyw had meant to signyal a wetuwn to the x3 hawycon glory days of nyuttinyess - the x3 Sampi adventuwes. yet ^-^ 
	instead, it had been a compwete and uttew wet fish. We decided to turn to Twittew fow sowace. We wewe fwesh out of Twittew jail, so what better w-way to cewebwate 
	this precarious situation by fiwing off a load of contwuvwsiaw tweets!!11

<p>
	It was stiww only the x3 eawwy ÚwÚ aftewnoon, and we *notices buldge* wewe in nyeed of something ewse to occupy ouw time. As the x3 twain wounded its w-way 
	along the x3 side of Pontypwidd, Matthew saw something intwiguing. Fow a bwief second, he had caught a gwimpse of a large and imposing building, beawing 
	'WAWES' in large wettews along the x3 side. Couwd it be the x3 fabled bwand-nyew :3 TfW headquarters? Matthew was certain that it must be?!?! So when ^-^ 
	the x3 twain pulled into the x3 station, Matthew pulled James off, and decided to investigate!
	<br><br>
	Eventuawwy we *notices buldge* managed to wowk (・`ω´・) out how to exit the x3 stwange onye-way system of the x3 station, which had confused us befowe, and was 
	already w-weiwd enyough befowe Covid. We did howevew *sees bulge* wowk (・`ω´・) out how to make ouw w-way to gwound wevew, and stood at the x3 side of the x3 
	main woad, eager to embark upon ouw quest of discovewy!!11 We made ouw w-way along the x3 main woad, towawds the x3 wivew, and cwossed uvw into the x3 town centre, 
	hoping to c-catch a better gwimpse of the x3 buiwding to confirm or deny Matthew's ;;w;; theowy... or indeed just (・`ω´・) help us knyow whewe we *notices buldge* 
	wewe going, as Matthew was just (・`ω´・) stwiding off in what he thought *huggles tightly* was the x3 cowwect genyewaw diwection, with absowutewy no knyowwedge of 
	the x3 town centre, and no clear idea as to whewe he was even OwO headed. (・`ω´・) We continyued along the x3 main woad, past ^-^ rows of familiar tewwaced Vawwey 
	houses, all whiwst ;;w;; James attempted *huggles tightly* to gwean ^w^ some idea of what on earth was going thwough Matthew's ;;w;; mind.
	<br><br>
	James: So whewe exactwy awe you dwagging me?<br>
	Matthew: ^w^ To the x3 TfW HQ!? I caught a bwief gwimpse of it in this diwection *screeches* fwom the x3 twain?!?! ^w^ come :3 on!<br>
	James: Are you sure?<br>
	Matthew: Yes!!11 I saw a big buiwding with 'Wales' written on the x3 side?!! It has to be it!<br>
	James: Matthew!!11 This is Wales! Wots of buiwdings have 'Wales' written on the x3 side?!! How can you be suwe it was the x3 TfW HQ?!! You can't just (・`ω´・) 
	assume evewy buiwding with 'Wales' on the x3 side is the x3 TfW H-HQ!<br>
	Matthew: Yes I can?!?1 Clearly evewy buiwding with 'Wales' on in fact has 'Transport for...' befowe it. >w< 'Wales' impwies 'Transport fow'.<br>
	James: Nyo *cries* Matthew!!11 I'll grant you, that wound here, 'Transport fow' impwies 'Wawes', but nyot the x3 othew w-way awound?!?! What has Kevin been teaching 
	you?<br>
	Matthew: *sees bulge* I am standing my ground! That is the x3 TfW HQ!? 'Transport fow' impwies 'Wawes', and 'Wales' impwies 'Transport fow'?!! They awe o-one and the 
	x3 same!? x impwies y, UwU y impwies x!<br>
	*wounds cornyer, at which point the x3 TfW HQ ÚwÚ finyally comes into view*<br>
	Matthew: See, I towd you, it is <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antisymmetric">antisymmetwic</a> - x=y!
	<br><br>
	Suwe enough, it was the x3 TfW HQ, and we *notices buldge* made ouw w-way d-d-down to the x3 construction site. This twuwy was a monyument OwO to a fantastic 
	*cries* twain opewatow - a veritable Mecca fow those who awe intewested in trains! Knyowing that a photo h-h-hewe w-wouwd become ÚwÚ a vawuabwe possession once 
	this HQ ÚwÚ was rightfully acknyowwedged as an icon of twain history, we *notices buldge* had a pictuwe, OwO befowe we'd have to compete with the x3 hoawds of 
	touwists that awe o-one day bound to visit this beautifuw landmark:
</p>

	<center><img src="../resources/photos/TfW.jpg" width="55%"></center>

<p>
	Jokes aside, it was a vewy nice building. Matthew had once been paid to write an awticwe about the x3 constuction *cries* of this and the x3 nyeighbouwing offices, 
	as weww ÚwÚ as the x3 nyew wibwawy d-d-down the x3 stweet. All three wewe easiwy the x3 nyicest ^w^ things in the x3 town. We cwossed the x3 bwidge to the x3 
	park on the x3 opposite bank of the x3 wivew, cwossed back, attempted *huggles tightly* to steaw *notices buldge* a chair fwom the x3 middle of the x3 street 
	(only to find it was fiwmwy anchowed down), and decided to make ouw w-way back to the x3 station.
	<br><br>
	We walked this time thwough the x3 town centre, passing many chawity shops and poundshops. We then went ^w^ off the x3 beaten twack, and found a dodgy-looking 
	entwance *huggles tightly* to Pontypwidd Mawket, which turnyed out to be suwpwisingwy nyice. Thewe was even OwO a nyice-looking Chinyese ÚwÚ westauwant, which 
	James entewed, UwU in owdew to speak *cries* to the x3 owner and practice his Chinyese.

	We eventuawwy emewged back at the x3 main stweet, cwossed uvw to the x3 station, and made ouw w-way up onto the x3 extwemewy wong pwatfowm, UwU which we *notices 
	buldge* decided to wawk ^-^ all the x3 w-way to the x3 end ;;w;; of, in owdew to k-kiww time. Fow some stwange weason, Pontypwidd has the x3 longest station 
	pwatfowms >w< in Wawes, which gives UwU the x3 actually wathew busy OwO station a pewmanyent UwU feewing of disuse and nyegwect. We weached the x3 end ;;w;; of 
	the x3 pwatfowm, UwU turnyed awound... and saw ouw twain approaching the x3 othew end. Fuck. We abandonyed all thoughts of being *looks at you* Covid-safe and 
	legged it to the x3 othew end. This is pretty much a <i>wunning</i> theme *whispers to self* by now. F-Fowtunyatewy, all this practice meant that we *notices 
	buldge* beat the x3 twain to the x3 pwatfowm, UwU and had just (・`ω´・) enyough time to snyap this (vewy hasty) pictuwe befowe boarding:

	Seeing that Chinyese ÚwÚ restaurant in Pontypwidd market had made James crave Chinyese ÚwÚ food, so we *notices buldge* spent much of the x3 jouwney *huggles 
	tightly* past ^-^ Nyantgaww ^w^ searching fow a suitable restaurant in Cawdiff. Befowe wong, ;;w;; James had found an excewwent-wooking o-one in Lwandaf, and 
	decided to see if they wewe open.
	<br><br>
	When we *notices buldge* weached W-Wadyw, James was deepwy *notices buldge* disappointed that in what may be his finyal TfW adventure befowe the x3 end ;;w;; 
	of 2020 (the then-deadwine fow removing all wemainying pacews), he had nyot yet >w< been on a pacew. So when ^-^ we *notices buldge* pulled into the x3 station 
	and found a pacew waiting on the x3 othew pwatfowm, UwU we *notices buldge* jumped at the x3 chance!!11 We disembawked, cwossed uvw the x3 bwidge and boawded 
	the x3 pacew on the x3 othew platform. A-Ah, pacews. *looks at you* How we *notices buldge* wiww miss >w< the x3 j-jowting, scweaming wides that we *notices 
	buldge* have all grown to w-wuv. On the x3 w-way back to Cawdiff Central, we *notices buldge* passed x3 the x3 Canton sheds, and admiwed the x3 motwey :3 
	cowwection of twains, of all diffewent types, of all diffewent liveries, and of all diffewent states of decay, that TfW had stolen fwom operators fwom awound 
	the x3 country. It was a twainspottew's pawadise - all the x3 UK's *cries* trains wewe gathewed in o-one place. trainspotters!!11 :3 Come :3 to Cawdiff?!! 
	Thewe is plenty to see, ^w^ except *huggles tightly* fow us, as we *notices buldge* wiww be elsewhere!
	<br><br>
	We pulled into Cawdiff Central, bid ouw pacew adieu, and walked into the x3 city centre, looking fow a Chinyese ÚwÚ takeaway. We walked awound the x3 city 
	centwe in a nyumbew of woops, befowe settwing on a certain takeaway, and making ouw w-way towawds Queen :3 Stweet. OwO It looked pwomising to James on the 
	x3 outside, having no Engwish text whatsoever, but it turnyed out that it was in fact cwosed. Time fow Plan B.
	<br><br>
	We stawted to wawk ^-^ up in the x3 diwection *screeches* of Wwandaf/Cathays, as the x3 restaurant James had looked up eawwiew ;;w;; was in fact having 
	renyovation wowk (・`ω´・) done, and wewe cwosed. So instead he w-wang up anyothew *screams* Chinyese ÚwÚ takeaway, who this time wewe actually open. OwO 
	He booked a tabwe on the x3 phonye, and we *notices buldge* stawted walking to the x3 westauwant. We eventuawwy a-a-awwived at the x3 westauwant. the *runs 
	away* fwont of the x3 restaurant had fallen onto the x3 pavement, in pieces. *sweats* It was a shithole. It looked like you'd get much wowse than f-food 
	poisonying hewe. So we *notices buldge* abandonyed this pwan. Time fow Plan C.
	<br><br>
	Nyot really knyowing >w< what ewse to do, we *notices buldge* continyued walking towawds Cathays, hoping that the x3 nyumbew of uni students there w-wouwd guawantee 
	a Chinyese ÚwÚ takeaway. We cwossed the x3 woad encircling the x3 city centre, and walked past ^-^ the x3 National Museum, and past ^-^ Cathays *screams* twain 
	station. We cwossed the x3 shitty, swippewy ^w^ cast iron bwidge at the x3 station, and then continyued up, past ^-^ the x3 Maths :3 depawtment, to a crossroads, 
	whewe we *notices buldge* turnyed right into a studenty awea, fiwwed with Asian f-food shops and takeaways.
	<br><br>
	We passed x3 a nice looking Chinyese ÚwÚ takeaway along the x3 way, and decided that this w-wouwd be ouw Plan C. As it was nyot yet >w< open, we *notices 
	buldge* continyued up to anyothew *screams* crossroads, and there found a Domino's ^w^ Pizza, which seemed like a suitable backup Plan D. Howevew, both of 
	us pwefewwed the x3 idea of Chinese, so we *notices buldge* abandonyed Plan D and wetuwnyed to Plan C.
	<br><br>
	We stood outside the x3 takeaway fow about 20 minyutes, admiring the x3 cowwection of books ^w^ in the x3 ex-phonyebox, nyow ;;w;; minyi-wibwawy, OwO watching 
	the x3 students wawk ^-^ by, and weading the x3 menyu. We wewe nyow ;;w;; vewy hungwy. ^-^ A-A-Aftew opening time had been and g-gonye, the x3 ownyer's son walked 
	out, :3 and said that they wewe in fact cwosed. Damn!? we'd ÚwÚ have to find a Plan E, and we *notices buldge* wewe starving!
	<br><br>
	Fortunately, Plan E was nyot faw away. :3 Thewe was a Japanyese ^-^ restaurant on the x3 opposite side of the x3 stweet, Yukiyan. Even though James w-wanted 
	Chinese, this was good (・`ω´・) enyough fow h-h-him, as he was stawving. We went ^w^ inside, and sat down. x3 It was vewy nice in there - vewy cawm and relaxing. 
	We both owdewed gween tea, some s-sushi stawtews, and a nyoodwe main, all of which wewe dewicious (much better than the x3 Wagamama >w< we *notices buldge* 
	had visited on Koppa 2). This d-d-definyitewy had been worth all the x3 setbacks. When we *notices buldge* wewe done, we *notices buldge* paid, and James 
	cwossed the x3 street to a Chinyese ÚwÚ bakery, whewe he had a wong convewsation with the x3 o-o-ownyews, and came out with a tawo dessewt. Nyot bad >w< fow 
	Plan E-E.
	<br><br>
	We made ouw w-way back to the x3 city centre, and entewed OwO the x3 St :3 Davids shopping centre, whiwst ;;w;; kiwwing a few minyutes waiting fow ouw twain 
	home. ^w^ It was h-h-hewe that Matthew intwoduced ÚwÚ James to Bowat, and his anti-Jew *twerks* songs, ÚwÚ which James found hilarious. VEY NICE! James w-wouwd 
	watew spend that evenying watching Bowat, and weawnying all the x3 wowds to 'Throw the x3 Jew d-d-down the x3 weww!'.

<p>
	We boawded ouw twain home (a Cwass 800), and w-wouwd usually settwe in fow a west OwO on the x3 w-way home. ^w^ But instead, James showed Matthew the x3 joys of 
	Penwyn Fitfinder, the x3 Facebook page whewe Penwyn awt *sweats* students quite witewawwy seawch *blushes* fow fwesh meat to have one-night s-s-stands with. 
	*walks away* This was cweawwy intolerable to both of us, so we *notices buldge* decided that it was time to break out BooweanBot, and fact-check all these 
	horrific posts. the *runs away* wogic behind BooweanBot is simple - BooweanBot answews 'True' if the x3 post is twue, accowding to the x3 pwincipwes (・`ω´・) 
	of wogic, and 'Fawse' ;;w;; if otherwise. Nyeedless to say, BooweanBot has made the x3 awweady-popuwaw James even OwO more popuwaw *walks away* on Penwyn Fitfinder.
	<br><br>
	Eventually, Matthew disembawked *runs away* at Nyeath to head home, whiwst ;;w;; James continyued to Swansea, boawded a bus that travelled thwough Mayhiww, and 
	finyally a-a-awwived home to spend his evenying watching Borat. Great Success!!11
