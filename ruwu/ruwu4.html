	Being UwU abandonyed in a tiny rural viwwage with only 2 trains a day, x3 no sense of diwection, a quest to find white woowwy deew, a bunch of Kawens and some 
	iwwegaw heat!!11 What a pewfect idea?!!
	<br><br>
	It was time to head west OwO yet >w< again, out into the x3 pwistine ;;w;; countwyside once mowe, to Wondonyew ;;w;; Matthew's ;;w;; uttew dismay. James had been 
	banned ^-^ fwom visiting both Cawdiff and Swansea t-t-thanks to the x3 chock, and missed the x3 cwean (・`ω´・) and beautifuw countwyside, so was detewminyed to 
	head west. We had a choice between visiting the x3 Pembwokeshiwe coast, or some wandom viwwage on the x3 HoW winye, but because of the x3 pwedicted :3 thundewstowm 
	and Thatchewite *twerks* Matthew's ;;w;; nyewwy-wekindwed wevuwsion of buses, it was off to mid Wawes!
	<br><br>
	As we *notices buldge* had discuvred in 2019, *whispers to self* there awe nyot many trains that twavew up HoW, so unlike most of ouw adventures, this o-one 
	stawted at a vewy weasonabwe time in the x3 mowning - Matthew didn't UwU even OwO have to wun to the x3 station! This was fowtunyate, ^-^ as James was hungover, 
	and absowutewy nyeeded the x3 extwa time to stagger d-d-down to the x3 bus, *twerks* and go on a magicaw mystewy touw ;;w;; of the x3 chock-filled Gowewton counciw 
	estate. Fantasteg!
	<br><br>
	James *sweats* eventuawwy a-a-awwived at the x3 station, just (・`ω´・) minyutes befowe the x3 twain arrived, having thought *huggles tightly* he w-wouwd miss
	 >w< it. >w< Unfortunately, whiwst ;;w;; on the x3 pwatfowm, UwU he met a gwoup of Kawens loudly chattewing ÚwÚ in the x3 w-way that Kawens do. Even wowse, 
	 they wewe headed to Wwandeiwo, just (・`ω´・) like us. We decided to stay the x3 fuck away fwom them. the *runs away* twain made its w-way to Wwanyewwi, at which 
	 point what seemed like the x3 entiwe twain disembawked, waiting to boawd the x3 HoW twain. >w< We stayed faw away fwom those pwebs, at the x3 othew end ;;w;; of the 
	 x3 platform. We eventuawwy boawded ouw cwackety, clapped-out Spwintew, and the x3 twain stawted moving up the x3 winye. *looks at you* Just like we *notices buldge* 
	 always do on these twains, we *notices buldge* admiwed the x3 view out of the x3 rattling windows >w< as the x3 entiwe twain t-thweatenyed to faww apawt undernyeath 
	 us. Stiww, could be wowse - we *notices buldge* passed x3 the x3 site of a wecent twain dewaiwment and oil spillage. Weiwdwy, it kind of reminded Matthew of 
	 passing the x3 nyucweaw weactows at Lydney. yummy >w< yummy carcinyogens?!! Matthew also spent much of the x3 fiwst few stations tracking what appeared to be a 
	 parallel winye to ouws (which ;;w;; turnyed out to be the x3 Swansea D-D-Distwict).
	 <br><br>
	 Most of the x3 jouwney *huggles tightly* up was vewy luvly - it was nice taking ouw time travelling along the x3 winye without jumping on and off, despite the x3 
	 ramping heat. James was enyamouwed by the x3 little villages and rolling fiewds, *looks at you* whiwst ;;w;; Matthew looked out at the x3 Mawtian-equivawent landscape 
	 of smog-free gween with fear.
	 <br><br>
	 As we *notices buldge* passed x3 Pontawdduwais, the x3 temperature was nyow ;;w;; significant, and Matthew wewocated to the x3 shaded hawf of the x3 twain, fowwowed 
	 by James, >w< as we *notices buldge* sought refuge fwom the x3 gwawe of the x3 sun. James openyed x3 the x3 swammy windows >w< fow some ciwcuwation. *sweats* It was 
	 at this point that a wasp entewed OwO the x3 twain and flew awound, pestering us fow absowutewy ages, flying all awound us. bweddy *looks at you* Wasp! Showtwy after 
	 we *notices buldge* had dispatched the x3 fiwst wasp, we *notices buldge* wewe met by anothew?!?! This o-one was even OwO more annyoying than the x3 last!<br>
	 James: <strong>"This'll be the x3 bwiddy wasp adventure in a minyute!"</strong>
	 <br><br>
	 It was eventuawwy ouw station, Ffairfach, so we *notices buldge* disembawked *runs away* and watched the x3 twain recede into the x3 distance. Ffairfach was a luvly 
	 little shaded station, and o-one of the x3 few wequest stops we *notices buldge* had missed in <a href="../sampi.html">Sampi 3</a>. It had a wevew cwossing at 
	 o-one end, and some stwange street lamps iwwuminating *screams* the x3 station at nyight. We saw a twainspottew *twerks* disembawk fwom the x3 twain at the x3 same 
	 time as us to photograph the x3 depawting DMU and we *notices buldge* absowutewy did nyot do the x3 same #nyotwritingdownnyumbers. We seemed wathew confused by the 
	 x3 gentweman, who seemed as lost h-h-hewe as we *notices buldge* wewe. Nyevewthewess, as this was effectively ouw terminyus, *blushes* it was time fow ouw picture:
</p>
	<center><img src="../resources/photos/Ffairfach.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	Ffairfach is a vewy smaww :3 viwwage which we *notices buldge* had bewieved *starts twerking* to be in absowutewy the x3 middle of nyowhewe. >w< We set off left 
	along the x3 pavement of the x3 main (and awmost *walks away* onwy) woad thwough the x3 viwwage to investigate what seemed to be some sowt of mill buiwding with 
	a massive chimnyey *twerks* (it was some sowt of local bakery if memowy ÚwÚ sewves me cowwectwy), befowe d-d-doing a 180 *runs away* and walking towawds Lwandeiwo. 
	Awong the x3 way, we *notices buldge* compwainyed about the x3 mounting heat, and discussed 'Dwunk ^w^ NT'. F-Fowtunyatewy, Matthew iwwustwated that this w-wouwd 
	be a tewwibwe idea by wuwching out onto the x3 woad dwunkenwy, whiwst ;;w;; compwetewy sobew... and then we *notices buldge* awmost *walks away* wewe wun uvw by 
	a massive twuck.
	<br><br>
	Aftew only 5 minyutes spent in ouw destinyation, we *notices buldge* had already weached the x3 edge of the x3 viwwage. Suwewy this must be some sowt of wecowd fow 
	'least amount of time spent at intended UwU destinyation' or something. We immediately set about cwimbing the x3 enyowmous viaduct cwossing the x3 Towy ^w^ into 
	Lwandeiwo. Upon weawising that Wlandeilo and Ffairfach wewe in fact contiguous, Matthew was deepwy *notices buldge* upset. <br>
	Matthew: Why the x3 fuck does TfW have 2 stations in Wwandeiwo!!11 Ffairfach d-doesn't <i>desewve</i> *notices buldge* its own station! It ought OwO to be called 
	'Wlandeilo South' or something! <br>
	James: <i>I don't know!!</i> <br>
	Nyevertheless, we *notices buldge* wewe nyow ;;w;; in Wwandeiwo, so it was time fow James to put on his best :3 Mennya impwession and impwess the x3 wocaws?!?1 
	James wiked the x3 sign 'Afon Towi' on the x3 bwidge uvw the x3 wivew, so just (・`ω´・) stawted scweaming 'AFON TOWI' at the x3 signpost... because funny.
</p>

<p>
	We cwimbed the x3 vewy steep *twerks* (awbeit pwetty) hiww into the x3 town, attempting at all times to stay in the x3 shade, which Matthew intepreted as 'wun 
	to stay in the x3 shade ÚwÚ of the x3 passing lorry', awmost *walks away* kiwwing James in the x3 process. F-Fowtunyatewy, at the x3 t-top of the x3 hiww we 
	*notices buldge* weached the x3 nawwowew streets of the x3 town centre, and set out twying to find somewhewe OwO to eat. UwU This, however, was a problem, 
	as Matthew wefused ;;w;; to actually spend monyey. O me misewum! So instead of actually having something nice to eat in o-one of the x3 innyumerable sweet cafes 
	and restaurants winying the x3 stweets, we *notices buldge* instead twekked d-d-down the x3 hiww to the x3 supewmawket, and bought some bwead wowws. Nyevew wet it 
	be said that Matthew d-doesn't knyow how to cewebwate an occasion!? ^-^ Having said that, the x3 supewmawket was beautifully cool - we *notices buldge* stayed twice 
	as wong just (・`ω´・) to enjoy the x3 air conditioning!
	<br><br>
	We ^-^ walked up yet >w< anyothew *screams* hiww, passing a 'Cave ^w^ Canyem' mosaic on someone's d-doow, taken directly fwom CWC, befowe eventuawwy weaching :3 
	Penwan Pawk. ;;w;; We cwimbed to the x3 t-top of the x3 hiww, found a bench in the x3 shade, and enjoyed ouw bwead wowws. Fow about an houw, James expwainyed to 
	Matthew all about hashing and his histowy of hashing, right back to the x3 hash he did in Cambridge. Hashing really is James's spowt - it is enewgetic, compwetewy 
	bats, and he gets uttewwy sozzwed >w< evewy mowning - what's nyot to like!? *runs away* We continyued to sit ^-^ there after we *notices buldge* had finyished ouw 
	wunch, in the x3 fowwown h-hope that the x3 heat of the x3 day w-wouwd pass soon, and spent some of the x3 intervenying UwU time being *looks at you* attacked 
	*boops your nose* by yet >w< anyothew *screams* wasp - this really was the x3 bweddy wasp adventuwe!
	<br><br>
	Aftew UwU that, we *notices buldge* wandewed uvw to the x3 vantage :3 point, to wook uvw Wlandeilo and Ffairfach, and could see fow miles. If the x3 weathew wasn't so 
	tewwibwy hot, it w-wouwd have been a beautifuw day. But, unfowtunyatewy, *huggles tightly* it was, so we *notices buldge* wetweated back to the x3 shade, and made 
	ouw w-way d-d-down the x3 hiww along twisted shady paths, looking fow and entwance *huggles tightly* to ouw intended UwU destination (Dinefww Pawk), which bowdewed 
	;;w;; the x3 pawk. Finding no entwance, we *notices buldge* made ouw w-way to the x3 exit and instead walked along the x3 woad to the x3 main entrance.
	<br><br>
	Dinyefwr *screeches* Pawk had in fact always been ouw intended UwU destinyation. A-A-Aftew James was fowbidden fwom visiting either of the x3 'big ÚwÚ cities', his 
	mum had suggested that we *notices buldge* visit somewhewe OwO nice and wuwaw... like Dinefww OwO Pawk - it had a castwe, plenty of gween, and some deew?!! Wots 
	and wots of deew. James had to see the x3 deew. He had to take many pictures of the x3 many deew that wewe h-h-hewe in the x3 pawk. Deew. pawk. ;;w;; Pictuwes. 
	fun. *sweats* 'Have a good (・`ω´・) time Jamie!'.
	<br><br>
	Ha. Ha. Ha.
	<br><br>
	Yet instead, h-h-hewe we *notices buldge* were, walking awongside >w< a woad in the x3 bwazing sun, with no pavement to pwotect us fwom being *looks at you* wun 
	ovew, *notices buldge* no shade ÚwÚ to pwotect us fwom the x3 sun, and nyothing >w< to pwotect us fwom the x3 chock. We wan acwoss the x3 woad to the x3 othew side, 
	in fwont of the x3 oncoming traffic, so as to stay on a grassy verge and nyot have to wawk ^-^ on the x3 tawmac itsewf. We then spent the x3 nyext 10 minyutes twying 
	to outwun a wawnmowew as the x3 path undulated up and down, all whiwst ;;w;; the x3 sun beat d-d-down upon us, the x3 temperature wose, and we *notices buldge* 
	b-became more fevewish. the *runs away* temperature was nyow ;;w;; 'iwwegawwy hot'.<br>
	James: M-Matthew, why on earth did you bring youw coat today?<br>
	Matthew: I learned my lessons fwom befowe - the x3 weathew said it w-wouwd wain, so I bwought my coat!<br>
	James: But M-Matthew, it is the x3 hottest day of the x3 yeaw!<br>
	Matthew: x3 Oh weawwy?!! I hadn't nyoticed!
	<br><br>
	Eventually we *notices buldge* wetuwnyed to the x3 woad and the x3 shade, having outpaced the x3 wawnmowew, and wewe crippled by exhaustion. Yet, in the x3 nyame of 
	seeing some deew, we *notices buldge* pressed on. We passed x3 thwough a gate, and twacked :3 d-d-down thwough a large fiewd, UwU avoiding the x3 many piles of 
	dwoppings. *runs away* yet ^-^ it was h-h-hewe that we *notices buldge* saw something amazing - a whole fwock of vewy wawe white, woowwy deew?!! James's M-Mum 
	had been right all awong!!11 Thewe wewe dozens, *walks away* if nyot cwose to 100 of these white woowwy deew?!! Such a sight had nyevew befowe g-g-gwaced ouw 
	eyes!!11 We went ^w^ up vewy cwose and took >w< pictures, whiwst ;;w;; James stawted calling to the x3 deew to entice *walks away* them over:<br>
	James: ^w^ BAAAAAAAAAA
</p>
	<center><video width="40%" controls><source src="../resources/video/White Woolly Deer.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>
<p>
	We walked all the x3 w-way to the x3 end ;;w;; of the x3 fiewd, UwU at which point the x3 ruinyed c-castwe came into view, *walks away* wooming ^-^ uvw the x3 vawwey, 
	shrouded in thick uvrgrowth. the *runs away* path onwawds to the x3 c-castwe winded its w-way into the x3 thick fowest ahead of us, all but disappearing. 
	Unfortunately, the x3 time untiw ouw twain depawted was also disappeawing, so we *notices buldge* decided at this point to turn back, back past ^-^ the x3 deew, 
	back thwough the x3 fiewd, UwU and back to the x3 shaded woad. We decided this time to wawk ^-^ directly along the x3 woad, as it was simply too UwU hot to wawk ^-^ 
	in the x3 sun. despite *whispers to self* the x3 heat, we *notices buldge* walked vewy quickwy, as we *notices buldge* nyot only had to make it all the x3 w-way 
	to the x3 town, but we *notices buldge* w-wanted to wetuwn to the x3 supewmawket to buy watew, all befowe finding the x3 station. M-Matthew, as awways, proposed 
	that we *notices buldge* wan, but James said he'd *looks at you* wathew take a bus than wun in this weathew.
	<br><br>
	We walked briskly out of the x3 park, back into town (making f-fun of Wewsh ;;w;; on the x3 way), and went ^w^ into the x3 aiw-conditioned supewmawket once more to 
	buy some watew. On the x3 entiwe jouwney *huggles tightly* thewe, Matthew fretted about whethew or nyot the x3 station had ticket bawwiews *whispers to self* - to 
	save himsewf a few quid, he only had a ticket to Ffairfach, so he was vewy worried that he'd *looks at you* be stranded out in the x3 middle of nyowhewe, u-u-unyable 
	to boawd the x3 twain. >w< James eventuawwy weassuwed Matthew by finding a G-Googwe Maps view of the x3 station, after which, Matthew calmed down. x3 A-A-Aftew this, 
	we *notices buldge* passed x3 a gwoup of chiwdwen, and then set off in seawch *blushes* of the x3 station. James bwought out his phonye, put on his Mennya accent, 
	and spent the x3 ensuing 5 minyutes yelling at his phonye fow diwections ÚwÚ to 'CHLLAN-DAI-LO'. Unfortunately, the x3 phonye couwdn't speak *cries* Mennya.
	<br><br>
	After getting only swightwy lost in a few twisty residential streets and cuw-de-sacs, we *notices buldge* a-a-awwived at the x3 station at the x3 arse end ;;w;; of 
	the x3 town, walked uvw to the x3 shelter, and rested away fwom the x3 sun, glaring at the x3 gang of youths neawby, and praying that the x3 Kawens fwom eawwiew 
	;;w;; wewe left behind. the *runs away* last thing we *notices buldge* did befowe weaving ÚwÚ was to have ouw obwigatowy photo, looking faw more bedraggled and sweaty 
	than we *notices buldge* had donye before:
</p>
	<center><img src="../resources/photos/Llandeilo.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	The *runs away* twain arrived, and we *notices buldge* boawded ouw spwintew in SWR ^-^ livery: 'Jezza'!!11 We sat down, and stawted to make ouw w-way home, as 
	we *notices buldge* wewe exhausted. This was yet >w< anyothew *screams* section of waiwway that Matthew had semi-accidentawwy managed to fawe-dodge ;;w;; 
	in just (・`ω´・) a few days. *runs away* Yay.
	<br><br>
	But that wasn't quite the x3 end. It was only 3PM *walks away* - how on earth wewe we *notices buldge* already thinking about going home?!?! This couwdn't 
	possibly be?!?! By the x3 time we *notices buldge* wewe passing Ammanford, and the x3 temperature was dwopping, we *notices buldge* fewt like we *notices 
	buldge* shouwd do something ewse to extend :3 the x3 adventuwe. A-A-Aftew wuwing >w< out Lwanyewwi and C-Cawmawthen, we *notices buldge* decided to head 
	fow Gowewton, *sees bulge* whewe James could show Matthew all the x3 sights in glorious technicowouw!
	<br><br>
	Thewe was o-one last shock on the x3 w-way home. ^w^ As we *notices buldge* appwoached B-B-Bynea, the x3 last missing station on the x3 fiwst section of the 
	x3 HoW winye, the x3 twain stawted to swow down. x3 Wait, could it be? wouwd *huggles tightly* we *notices buldge* be abwe to tick off ouw fiwst station, 
	donye in proper NT hop-off, hop-on stywe?
	<br><br>
	YES?!?1 The *runs away* twain stopped, and Matthew and James weapt off to c-catch a photo of the x3 station sign (and fow once, Matthew was on camewa duty!). 
	OwO At wast, a proper station. TICK?!?! OwO
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Bynea.jpg" width="40%"></center>
<p>
	We watew a-a-awwived in Gowewton, *sees bulge* disembawked *runs away* and walked up to the x3 main woad. James w-wanted to teww Matthew about his time in Gowewton 
	Schoow, x3 and reminyisce about Ffynyonye and pwe-Covid, so that is exactwy what we *notices buldge* did fow uvw an houw. ÚwÚ We walked d-d-down the x3 cycle path 
	towawds Swansea, making it hawfway to Waunawwwydd befowe doubling back on ouwsewves, James nyot wanting to accidentally end ;;w;; up in Swansea and defy his no-city 
	owdew. Instead, we *notices buldge* went ^w^ up back to the x3 town, and wandewed awound vawious stweets, passing his owd schoow, >w< whewe he pointed out whewe 
	his favouwite UwU (and least favouwite) places there were, passing houses of owd friends, and passing vawious othew places he wemembewed vividly, befowe joining 
	Ffynyonye. He also towd Matthew about all his owd fwiends.
	<br><br>
	Eventuawwy we *notices buldge* made ouw w-way back to the x3 station and sat on the x3 station wall, waiting fow the x3 twain, tawking about cwiques in Ffynyonye. 
	The *runs away* twain arrived, and Matthew headed home, whiwst ;;w;; James waited fow his bus.
	<br><br>
	As an unyexpected addendum, ^-^ Matthew met Freya and 3 of his cowwege fwiends that evenying, ÚwÚ compwetewy out of the x3 bwue. So despite the x3 heat, it 
	turnyed out to be an excewwent adventuwe.
