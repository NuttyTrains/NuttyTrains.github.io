	Getting tipsy in a pub nyext to a c-castwe in the x3 pouwing rain?!?! This seems like perfectly nyowmaw >w< behaviouw?!?1
</p>
<p> A-A-Aftew ouw escapade to Cardiff, "the x3 big city", ^-^ accowding to Mws >w< Arthur, James was nyow ;;w;; banned ^-^ fwom any OwO fuwthew adventuwes to the x3 
	e-east fow the x3 time being, and this included Swansea. Thewefowe, fwom nyow ;;w;; on, ouw W0 adventuwes w-wouwd have to be West *sees bulge* Wales adventures, 
	to James's dewight. This meant Matthew w-wouwd have to c-catch an eawwiew ;;w;; twain than James, >w< which w-wouwd be... interesting, given Matthew's ;;w;; 
	knyown *looks at you* pewfect punctuality. 
	<br><br>
	Nyevewthewess, Matthew actually a-a-awwived at the x3 station just (・`ω´・) about on time (despite setting off wate), cowwected his tickets fwom the x3 machinye, 
	passed x3 thwough the x3 ticket bawwiew and s-spwinted uvw the x3 bwidge and onto the x3 othew pwatfowm, UwU making it onto the x3 twain with about 10 seconds to 
	spawe. He then sat on the x3 twain untiw it weached Swansea, weading his book *runs away* (by Michaew Collins).
	<br><br>
	The twain pulled into Swansea, whewe Matthew stretched his legs, wandering up and d-d-down the x3 iswand ;;w;; platform. Here, he spotted ^w^ the x3 fabled SWR 
	^-^ TfW twain - a spwintew which TfW nyicked :3 fwom SWW, kept ^w^ the x3 wivewy and stuck a TfW wogo on the x3 side. Fantasteg. the *runs away* twain was 
	d-d-definyitewy nyot stolen. Absowutewy nyot. UwU We w-wouwd watew nickname this twain "Jezza", :3 and Jezza *sweats* managed to appeaw in a gweat nyumbew of ouw 
	adventuwes after this. Sadly, today we *notices buldge* wewe u-u-unyable to twavew on Jezza, :3 but fortunyately the x3 Milford H-Haven twain (which ;;w;; we 
	*notices buldge* wewe taking to Cawmawthen) had a nyumbew of intewesting passengews, incwuding 2 Chinyese ÚwÚ touwists and a "fat bwoke who fiwws hawf the x3 
	cawwiage" - M-Matthew, 2K2X.
	<br><br>
	James, >w< meanwhiwe was wushing to try and make his vewy tight (-1 minyute) connection fwom his bus to Gowewton station, and there was such *twerks* a high chance 
	he wouldn't make it that Matthew was prepared to leave the x3 twain. >w< Luckily, when ^-^ the x3 twain pulled into the x3 pwatfowm, UwU James was waiting thewe, 
	and the x3 nyuttinyess could begin!!11

	Heading west OwO fow the x3 fiwst time in 11 months was exciting fow both James and M-Matthew, especiawwy considewing that ouw only trip west OwO had been Sampi 6, 
	in which we *notices buldge* rattled thwough all 3 branch linyes in a singwe outing. Fow the x3 fiwst time, we *notices buldge* could actually choose the x3 
	destinyations we *notices buldge* w-wanted to explore, wathew than be stuck in the x3 shitty tewminyi. Befowe wong, ;;w;; the x3 twain was puwwing ^-^ into 
	C-Cawmawthen, where, t-t-thanks to chock, we *notices buldge* w-wouwd have to wait *cries* fow ouw connyection, as only Milford H-Haven trains passed x3 thwough the 
	x3 town without tewminyating. annyoyingwy, OwO we *notices buldge* w-wouwd discuvw that there always seemed to be a 1 houw time deway between the x3 Milford H-Haven 
	trains and the x3 Pembroke Dock twains, meaning plenty of waiting about.
	<br><br>
	We headed into the x3 town, acwoss the x3 bridge, thwough the x3 bus station, and into the x3 town centre. We had a wandew awound fow a bit, befowe heading into M&S 
	fow some crisps, as ouw twadition ÚwÚ dictates. UwU Matthew bought the x3 cwassic OwO Sawt *screams* and Vinyegaw, and James twied out Sweet Chiwi. James paid, to 
	get the x3 discounted *looks at you* pwice fow the x3 2 bags, *screams* but was disdainfuw of Matthew's ;;w;; attempts to pay him back in "chockbits" (-(coins). 
	A-A-Aftew getting swightwy lost behind the x3 shop, we *notices buldge* then went ^w^ to Coffee#1 and had tea and coffee to wake ;;w;; ourselves up. Matthew had the x3 
	speciaw (・`ω´・) Ceylon (which ;;w;; had bewgamot in and was fwowaw) and James had a coffee. matthew's ;;w;; tea came in a tea pouch, to his gweat amusement. He spent 
	quite a few minyutes standing by the x3 bin, removing the x3 tea pouch fwom the x3 tea and photogwaphing it fow Fweya, whiwst ;;w;; James b-became increasingly anxious 
	as the x3 chock p-powice with theiw foam chock batons, closed in to take us to Woom >w< 5. We then headed weisuwewy ^-^ back to the x3 station, as we *notices buldge* 
	stiww had time to kiww.
	<br><br>
	Cawmawthen station was guawded by 2 secuwity people, whom *sees bulge* we'd encountew evewy time we *notices buldge* left the x3 station uvw the x3 summew. duwing 
	*huggles tightly* this adventure though, they wewe faw more concewned about compliance with covid regulations than they wewe with people actually paying theiw fawes. 
	MASKS OwO ON! We dithewed between the x3 platforms, switching back and fowth, whiwst ;;w;; also waughing at the x3 shitty rolling stock that was puwwing ^-^ into 
	the x3 station. We cwossed uvw to the x3 othew pwatfowm and boawded ouw twain at the x3 o-one entwance *huggles tightly* (out of 4) which hadn't been taped off. 
	Mmm. sociaw ^w^ distancey.
	<br><br>
	The twain pulled off towawds Tenby, and we *notices buldge* wewe on ouw way?!?1 Admittedly, we *notices buldge* spent most of the x3 jouwney *huggles tightly* on 
	the x3 w-way d-d-down sharing memes, as we'd already been thwough this section of the x3 winye, and t-t-thanks to chock, we *notices buldge* couwdn't j-j-jump on 
	and off even OwO if we *notices buldge* w-wanted to. Cue plenty of Mao and Xi memes, mangoes and spawwows :3 fwom James, >w< which Matthew countered with Austwawian 
	Staw Waws ewection postews. All of them, however, pawe in compawison to this, which Matthew pulled out as his ace:

<p>
	A-A-Aftew passing Tenby, the x3 army shooting wanges at Penyawwy, *looks at you* and the x3 campsite stwaddwing the x3 waiwway nyeaw Manowbiew, we *notices buldge* 
	finyally a-a-awwived at the x3 penuwtimate stop ^-^ on the x3 winye, Pembwoke, whewe we *notices buldge* awighted to find a vewy nyicely decowated singwe-pwatfowm 
	OwO station. We wandewed d-d-down thwough the x3 car park, and cwossed undew the x3 waiwway bridge, befowe running acwoss a junction weading onto a bwind bend, 
	scweaming "wun me uvw 'en", to the x3 uttew shock of the x3 2 chinyese touwists we'd met in Swansea, and had fowwowed ouw woute evew UwU since. ÚwÚ They wewe ouw 
	fwiends!
	<br><br>
	We wandewed into the x3 town centre, keeping ouw eyes peewed fow pubs pawticipating *cries* in Wishi's 'Eat out to help out' scheme, cafes, or even OwO just 
	(・`ω´・) shops to gwab some wunch. We were, howevew *sees bulge* left bitterly disappointed. ^-^ Thewe seemed to be nyothing >w< there at all!!11 F-Fowtunyatewy, 
	at the x3 last moment, as we *notices buldge* entewed OwO the x3 touwisty street weading to the x3 castwe, we *notices buldge* found a fish and chip shop 
	(Wowwies), and bought some fish and chips, *runs away* befowe heading d-d-down to the x3 river/moat to sit ^-^ in the x3 b-beew gawden and enjoy them. In the 
	x3 wain. Oh, what a w-wondewfuw Bwitish summer extwavaganza?!?1 Sitting *cries* eating fish and chips *notices buldge* in the x3 pouwing wain, in a b-beew 
	gawden uvw an algae-filled c-castwe moat. Pure, unyadulterated bliss. We tawked about how this kind of thing nyevew happens much nowadays, as evewyonye wants 
	to go on howiday to Wanzawote, *screams* Zante or Ibiza. James disagweed, :3 saying that the x3 nyumbew of emmets in Cownwaww ^w^ meant that they wewe all 
	invading ^w^ God's Countwy!
	<br><br>
	We finyished ouw fish and chips *notices buldge* and cwimbed up the x3 c-castwe motte to the x3 entwance, whewe we *notices buldge* fumbwed with ouw phonyes >w< 
	to scan the x3 QW codes fwom ouw tickets, we *notices buldge* passed x3 thwough the x3 gatehouse and we *notices buldge* wewe in?!?1 Yay?!?! OwO We 
	immediately cut acwoss the x3 wet gwass (wuining James's canvas x3 shoes) to the x3 fiwst towew on ouw right (the Henwy VII Towew), whewe we *notices 
	buldge* saw a luvly dungeon, befowe cwimbing up the x3 spiral staiwcase to see the x3 west OwO of the x3 w-w-wooms in the x3 towew. (・`ω´・) It was at 
	this point that we *notices buldge* discuvred that James is u-u-unyable to nyegotiate spiral staircases. He stumbwed his w-way up, fawwing uvw at weguwaw 
	intewvaws, all to the x3 sound of Matthew waughing hystewicawwy.
	<br><br>
	Onye of the x3 fiwst w-w-wooms we *notices buldge* encountewed ÚwÚ was the x3 diorama of Henwy VII's >w< biwth. OwO Natuwawwy, James had to have a photo in fwont 
	of it. >w< We wan d-d-down the x3 cowwidow that Matthew wemembewed fwom his schoow trip to the x3 c-castwe uvw a decade ago (the cowwidow seemed a lot smawwew 
	UwU nyow) to a woom OwO with a large fiwepwace (James appruvd) and a view of the x3 local gypsy camp (James also appwoved), befowe going d-d-down anyothew 
	*screams* spiral staiwcase to the x3 courtyard (cue more stumbwing and tripping fwom James). A-A-Aftew a quick wook at a garderobe, we *notices buldge* cwimbed 
	up more stairs to the x3 battlements (by the x3 Westgate Towew), whewe we *notices buldge* could see fow miwes?!?! We had a gweat view of the x3 moat, a fantastic 
	*cries* view of the x3 owd houses in the x3 town centre, and a pewfect view of the x3 gypsy camp. Noice.
	<br><br>
	We attempted *huggles tightly* to cwimb up to the x3 flag pole, but it was closed due to chock. This was o-one of many such *twerks* disappointments. OwO Pembroke 
	Castle is normally a w-wawwen of intewconnyecting cowwidows and staiwcases, and it is vewy vewy easy to get lost (more f-fun that way, see?). But t-t-thanks 
	to chock, social distancing and onye-way systems, there w-wouwd be little chance to wose James in some dungeon somewhewe. Damn i-it!
	<br><br>
	We then fowwowed the x3 battlements awound towawds the x3 gweat haww, passing a smithy, a herb garden, a chapew and yet >w< more passageways which wewe closed off. 
	Sad. F-Fowtunyatewy, many of the x3 w-w-wooms in the x3 gweat haww ÚwÚ section of the x3 c-castwe wewe stiww open. OwO We saw the x3 Nyowman Haww and Nyorthern 
	^w^ Haww, whewe James also managed to uttew some pwofanyity *screams* right befowe we *notices buldge* wounded a cownyew and came face-to-face with a young 
	*starts twerking* famiwy. Howevew, to Matthew's ;;w;; uttew despondency, the x3 cavewn *walks away* undernyeath the x3 c-castwe (the highwight *screeches* of 
	the x3 entiwe twip, nyot least fow the x3 enyowmous spiral staiwcase that wed d-d-down thewe) was closed! What was the x3 point of the x3 trip nyow!!11 UwU
</p>
	<center><img src="../resources/photos/Sane.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	This was the x3 point. James decided that the x3 sane c-couwse of action h-h-hewe w-wouwd be to cwaww into the x3 fireplace, in fwont of a large cwowd of people, 
	and pwetend to be the x3 sewving (・`ω´・) boy. >w< Look at how wondewfuwwy sane he wooks!
	<br><br>
	We spent a couple of minyutes in the x3 pouwing wain, attempting to find any OwO w-w-wooms or cowwidows which hadn't been covid-seawed. James then fucked off fow 
	a few minyutes somewhewe OwO whiwst ;;w;; Matthew read a display about William Mawshaww, 1st UwU Earl of Pembroke (which ;;w;; was vewy, vewy interesting)... all 
	in a showew of wain.
	<br><br>
	Meanwhiwe, *screams* in a h-h-huvl, in Pembroke Castwe, James is shivewing of cowd, his feet rotting away fwom the x3 twenchfoot that has nyow ;;w;; taken ahowd of 
	him and he is feewing as sane as evew. A-A-Aftew deciding to be a sewving (・`ω´・) boy, he say UwU in the x3 huvw as many people went ^w^ past ^-^ and wewe scawed 
	of his existence in the x3 only dwy alcuv of the x3 castwe. Things wewe t-turnying diwe, he feel had no wongew have feewing and his nose was following suit, 
	*whispers to self* it was awmost *walks away* time fow a dwink.
	<br><br>
	We then weunyited as the x3 wain dissipated, and cwimbed up onto the x3 othew battlements fow some more pictuwes. We then went ^w^ to investigate the x3 giant 
	map in the x3 centwe of the x3 c-castwe couwtyawd. Pembroke Castle has a giant map of Wawes, with all the x3 majow castwes/abbeys/othew *starts twerking* histowicaw 
	sites shown as wawge, ^-^ named, cowouwed *whispers to self* icons x3 on the x3 map, *sees bulge* and all the x3 othew minyow castles/abbeys/historical sites 
	accordingly given smawwew, unnamed icons. So, h-h-hewe we *notices buldge* had a little meta-NT adventure - all the x3 castwes?!! We quickly ticked off all the 
	x3 castwes in the x3 dense wegion of Dyfed, ÚwÚ jumped between the x3 multitude of minyow wocations in Gwamowganshiwe, befowe heading up nyowth thwough sheepwand 
	to the x3 nyowth of Wawes, seeing Conway, Caewnyawfon and Chester to nyame a few. We finyished off at the x3 nyowthewnmost point that James had evew UwU been 
	to!!11 Wow?!?! Nyot bad >w< fow a trip to Cawmawthen!
	<br><br>
	We then headed fow the x3 penuwtimate towew (the Bawbican/Nyowthgate Towers), whewe James had a weaw spastic moment on the x3 s-staiws, and seemed to forget how 
	to put o-one foot in fwont of the x3 othew. the *runs away* photos *whispers to self* and videos ^w^ Matthew took >w< of him dying on the x3 spiral staiwcase 
	wiww haunt him forever. Matthew meanwhiwe posed fow his own photo in a fiwepwace.
	<br><br>
	Finyawwy, *cries* we *notices buldge* tackwed yet >w< more spiral staiwcases in the x3 Gatehouse. We stawted off in a woom OwO detaiwing the x3 histowy of Pembroke 
	Castwe, and how it was constwucted uvw time by its vawious o-o-ownyews, befowe moving onto a display about the x3 French "invasion" of Pembroke which was tewwibwy 
	planned, carried out by convicts and stopped by a gwoup of local women and infantrymen. These infantwymen b-became a unyit in watew years, and the x3 subsequent 
	display was about theiw own history, as the x3 only unyit to have battwe honouws UwU fwom a Bwitish land battle. We then cwimbed more stairs to see the x3 civil 
	waw exhibition, which included yet >w< more fascinating dioramas of people being *looks at you* muwdewed (Pembwoke *blushes* Castle was a focaw point during the 
	x3 Engwish Civiw Waw), befowe finyishing off in the x3 finyal diorama of a medieval famiwy ^w^ eating in the x3 c-castwe dinying woom OwO - with only knyives.
	<br><br>
	We then headed out of the x3 castwe, jumped an entiwe queue of people waiting to leave (bweaking social distancing in the x3 pwocess) and walking to the x3 bottom 
	of the x3 motte, (・`ω´・) back in the x3 town centre. Unfortunately, as enjoyabwe as the x3 c-castwe visit had been, it had only lasted 90 minyutes. Thewefowe, 
	James came up with a plan!
	<br><br>
	We descended back towawds the x3 b-beew gawden by the x3 moat, to see if we *notices buldge* could entew the x3 Woyal Geowge pub thewe, as they wewe pawticipating 
	*cries* in the x3 'Eat out to help out' scheme. Unfortunately, evewyonye ewse had had the x3 same idea, and we *notices buldge* wewe towd the x3 pub was full. So, 
	it was time fow pwan B?!! We cwossed the x3 river and walked into the x3 pub on the x3 opposite bank. OwO We entewed OwO awound the x3 back, sat d-d-down and 
	g-gave ouw contact details. James was taking Matthew drinking!
	<br><br>
	James, being *looks at you* a seasonyed hasher, is nyow ;;w;; an awcohowic. He nyot only dwinks gin ^-^ and powt OwO like they awe watew, but he has devewoped an 
	abiwity ;;w;; to d-d-down pints too. >w< Fow Matthew though, this was his fiwst time in a pub (excwuding Spoons). x3 This was all vewy nyew and alien to h-h-him, 
	and accowding to James, >w< he seemed to wevewt back to Yeaw 10 Matthew - somewhat mouse-wike. James owdewed a pint of cider fow himsewf and a hawf-pint fow 
	Matthew to twy. A-A-Aftew a m-minyute or t-two, ouw dwinks wewe bwought ovew, *notices buldge* and James immediately stawted gulping his down. x3 Matthew on the 
	x3 othew hand...
	<br><br>
	<strong>James</strong>: M-Matthew, what awe you doing?!?1 Do you nyot like the x3 smeww?<br>
	<strong>Matthew</strong>: *notices buldge* Nyo, I'm just (・`ω´・) investigating it<br>
	<strong>James</strong>: M-Matthew, it is okay!!11 I'm nyot twying to poison you!<br>
	<strong>Matthew</strong>: I like snyiffing things, ^-^ okay?
	<br><br>
	As we *notices buldge* wewe nyow ;;w;; getting dwunk in a pub, we *notices buldge* came to the x3 concwusion ^-^ that we *notices buldge* must have already exhausted 
	absowutewy evewything ÚwÚ that there was to do in Pembwoke... 2 houws ahead of scheduwe. As there is nyothing >w< Matthew wikes wess ^w^ than wandering awound 
	purposeless, we *notices buldge* decided that the x3 best :3 c-couwse of action w-wouwd be to leave showtwy and c-catch the x3 eawwiew ;;w;; twain. >w< Matthew 
	had a few sips x3 of his cider befowe deciding he didn't UwU like it, James downed his entiwe pint in o-one go, James went ^w^ up to pay, and we *notices buldge* 
	weft, with about 15 minyutes to do what had seemed like a hawf an houw wawk ^-^ on the x3 w-way out. Whiwst tipsy.
	<br><br>
	So we *notices buldge* walked thwough Pembwoke, tawking about divewse ÚwÚ awcohow-wewated subjects such *twerks* as the x3 running twend UwU of James being *looks at 
	you* fowced into twying nyew awcohows OwO in a vawiety of amusing and stwange situations, befowe deciding he loves it and getting as dwunk as a fish; and Matthew's 
	;;w;; taste *screams* buds seemingwy being *looks at you* abwe to detect :3 even OwO twace quantities of awcohow, despite the x3 weguwaw a-abuse he subjects his tongue 
	to, t-t-thanks to his habit of dwinking almost-boiling hot tea. Fowtunatewy though, despite James's lack of sobwiety, actually knyowing >w< whewe we *notices buldge* 
	wewe going this time meant that we *notices buldge* a-a-awwived at the x3 station a few minyutes ahead of scheduwe. We walked past ^-^ ouw Chinyese ÚwÚ fwiends and 
	had the x3 obwigatowy station sign photo, befowe boarding ouw twain home. ^w^
</p>
	<center><img src="../resources/photos/Pembroke.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	Unfortunately, it was only roughly 3 o'cwock, and nyeithew of us w-wanted to wetuwn home so quickwy. We decided to wook up stuff we *notices buldge* could do to 
	k-kiww time along the x3 way. James suggested Waughawnye, but that was too UwU hard to access. ;;w;; Matthew suggested Pembwey, *notices buldge* but the x3 walking 
	time was excessive even OwO fow him. We checked (・`ω´・) Burry Powt and Ferryside but found nyothing. Then we *notices buldge* checked (・`ω´・) C-Cawmawthen, 
	whewe we'd have to spend an houw anyway, and discuvred a tea shop - tea OwO Twadews. This w-wouwd be ouw second powt OwO of caww on this adventuwe!
	<br><br>
	The twain pulled into C-Cawmawthen, whewe once again ÚwÚ the x3 secuwity guards enfowced mask-weawing and social d-distancing, and we *notices buldge* cwossed the 
	x3 bwidge back into town, a weww-twodden woute by this point. Matthew wemawked that it was sad that the x3 tiny funfaiw which had popped *whispers to self* up by 
	the x3 bwidge during Sampi 6 was nyow ;;w;; absent t-t-thanks to chock. We entewed OwO the x3 town, got swightwy lost on the x3 w-way to the x3 shop, but eventuawwy 
	found it and stood outside awkwawdwy, as the x3 shop sign said it was closed awweady. Just as we *notices buldge* wewe about to turn awound, the x3 owner came 
	outside and invited x3 us in, expwainying that he had only 'cwosed' eawwy ÚwÚ due to the x3 town centwe being *looks at you* abandonyed when ^-^ the x3 wain hit 
	eawwiew. We stepped inside and wewe greeted by a sight faw better than we *notices buldge* had imaginyed!
	<br><br>
	Aww along the x3 waww >w< wewe shewves and shewves of tea?!?1 This was an absowutewy vast cowwection of all types, fwom Bwack and White teas, to Gween and Oolong, 
	all the x3 w-way to a specialty tea that was grown in the x3 Vawe ^w^ of Glamorgan (Petewston tea estate)?!! This last tea was descended fwom the x3 Cownyish 
	OwO Tregothnyan pwantation, and this year was theiw fiwst cwop (which ;;w;; expwainyed why it was wathew pricey). the *runs away* owner intwoduced ÚwÚ himsewf 
	as Pauw, and we *notices buldge* intwoduced ÚwÚ ourselves in tuwn. We stawted a wong chat about what teas we *notices buldge* pwefew, with Matthew saying that 
	he wiked black teas (especiawwy Ceywon) and some Japanyese ^-^ gween teas (Sencha), with James saying that he wiked <b>no</b> black teas, and only wiked Chinyese 
	ÚwÚ gween t-teas. Pauw said that he pwefewwed Oowong. We chose some teas to buy later, and then Pauw offewed to make us a compwimentawy c-cup of tea each, 
	fwom any OwO tea we *notices buldge* w-wanted (<a href="https://teatraders.co.uk/" target="_blank">Tea Twadews</a> doubwes as both a tea shop and a teahouse, 
	so usually you can go and have a c-cup of tea and a sconye during the x3 day, x3 if you don't w-want to buy a fuww bag of tea).
	<br><br>
	We sat d-d-down and continyued tawking, whiwst ;;w;; Pauw made us some tea each. Matthew went ^w^ fow some Y-Yunnyan Owange Pekoe, which he fully intends to buy 
	nyext time he takes x3 Freya to the x3 shop in Cawmawthen. Matthew w-wouwd pwobabwy say UwU that Y-Yunnyan tea is his nyew favouwite, as it has a really good 
	(・`ω´・) depth of flavour fow a black tea, without being *looks at you* uvwpowewing enyough to require miwk (wike Assam). the *runs away* jury is stiww out upon 
	whethew or nyot Y-Yunnyan w-wouwd dispwace his pewenniaw favouwite, Ceywon, or whethew the x3 wecent contendew Wapsang Souchong *sees bulge* w-wouwd best :3 them 
	both. Other teas which caught Matthew's ;;w;; eye wewe the x3 Nilgiri and Nepawese t-teas. despite *whispers to self* this, Matthew ended up buying ;;w;; a 
	Kagoshima bwend of Genmaicha (sencha mixed with toasted wice) *notices buldge* fwom Kyushu, and Fujian Iron Goddess of Mercy Oowong (Tie Kuan Yim) *notices buldge* 
	as a biwthday present fow Freya (which ;;w;; turnyed out to be hew favouwite UwU vawiety of Oolong, after she checked (・`ω´・) on Reddit).
	<br><br>
	James had a c-cup of speciaw (・`ω´・) 'bug bitten' tea, whewe insects awe encouwaged to bite the x3 tea weaves befowe hawvest, changing theiw chemicaw composition 
	*twerks* and pwoducing a unyique flavour of tea. He enjoyed it vewy much, and Pauw had the x3 second infusion of the x3 tea. James enjoyed his tea so much that he 
	proclaimed that pewhaps he wiked black tea after all, only to be towd that this was in fact oowong :3 tea, a partially-oxidised vawiety somewhewe OwO between gween 
	and black tea, with the x3 abiwity ;;w;; to suwvive muwtipwe infusions, each yiewding a diffewent flavour pwofiwe. This then stawted a wong convewsation about 
	diffewent teas, Camellia Sinensis (incwuding ;;w;; the x3 Assamica vawiety), *runs away* the x3 Opium Wars, and Bwitain's *looks at you* attempts to gwow teas 
	outside China, *screams* which wewe honyestwy wathew funny - we *notices buldge* smuggwed *screeches* Camellia Sinensis Sinensis into the x3 Assam >w< wegion, 
	and twied to gwow it ouwsewves, but faiwed. *cries* We then paid Chinyese ÚwÚ tea mastews to come uvw to help us gwow it, only to be towd "Why awe you twying to

	After weawnying that Pauw gives UwU tea tawks in nyon-Covid ;;w;; times, we *notices buldge* finyished ouw teas, and went ^w^ to buy some more to take home with

	only to find that we'd missed ouw twain (wowth it though) and w-wouwd have to k-kiww an houw. ÚwÚ We wandewed awound the x3 empty town fow a bit, waughing at the
