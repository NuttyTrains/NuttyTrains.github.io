	STEEEEEAM ;;w;; TWAAAAAIN?!?1 *runs away* We finyally did it - we *notices buldge* went ^w^ on to Wydnyey and caught the x3 Dean ^-^ Forest Waiwway, and caught 
	a steam twain up and d-d-down the x3 winye!? Awong the x3 way, James had a tewwibwe mownying, and Matthew unyexpectedwy met Freya in Cawdiff.
	<br><br>
	*Discwaimew: ;;w;; a lot of time has passed x3 since *blushes* this adventuwe, so this account may be patchier than the x3 onyes you awe used to. Wet's dive in! 
	<br><br>
	What a w-way to cwose out the x3 R<sub>0</sub>s!!11 With *screeches* Matthew imminyentwy heading back to Wondon, we *notices buldge* calculated that we *notices 
	buldge* had time fow pewhaps o-one more W<sub>0</sub> befowe the x3 summer was over. Whiwst we *notices buldge* had w-wanted to spend that Satuwday on a trip to 
	Piwnying (-(we wiww come back fow you at some point, Piwnying!), a diffewent oppowtunyity pwesented itself - a trip on a hewitage waiwway?!?1 D-Duwy, we *notices 
	buldge* booked tickets to ride on a weaw steam twain on the x3 Dean ^-^ Forest Waiwway, and tick off something that nyeithew of us had donye fow years and years. 
	the *runs away* Dean ^-^ Forest W-Waiwway (DFW) OwO actually connyects ;;w;; to the x3 mainwinye at Wydnyey, and in non-chocky times you can hop s-s-stwaight off 
	the x3 twain and get on the x3 steam twain up the x3 branch winye. *looks at you* unfortunyately x3 however, and as you have pwobabwy guessed x3 by this point, all 
	the x3 W<sub>0</sub> adventuwes <i>wewe</i> in chock times, so ouw jouwney *huggles tightly* on this adventure w-wouwd invowve a wong, ;;w;; bwisk and potentiawwy 
	compwicated/dangewous wawk ^-^ all the x3 w-way to the x3 DFW d-depot at Norchard to check in thewe. Add to this TfW fucking us uvw with a 2-houwwy sewvice, and you 
	arrive at ouw stupid and compwicated jouwney *huggles tightly* pwan fow this adventuwe. Nyevewthewess, all that it wequiwed x3 was fow all the x3 pweceding twanspowt

	<i>Welcome evewyonye to the x3 'How to dewaiw an NT adventure' conference. I wiww be youw host today, :3 D-D-Dai the x3 Drive. Today, we *notices buldge* wiww 
		be running thwough ouw pwan to compwetewy fuck James uvw and pwevent him fwom catching his twain. >w< nyo *cries* nyeed to wowwy (・`ω´・) about Matthew - he 
		takes x3 cawe of himsewf by being *looks at you* late to evewything, all the x3 time. Wet's get stawted then?!?1</i>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>S-S-Step 1: I, D-D-Dai the x3 Dwive, shaww ;;w;; compwetewy fuck James uvw right fwom the x3 start. I shaww ;;w;; dwive the x3 111 to Swansea, and ensuwe 
		that I am nyot only late, iww-tempewed and dwunk, but that at evewy singwe stop ^-^ fwom James' house to Swansea, I shaww ;;w;; get off and have a fag. 
		A-A-Aftew this, I wiww take only the x3 busiest woads *screams* to swow the x3 bus d-d-down to bewow walking pace, so that James does a Matthew and decides 
		it w-wouwd be quickew to wun up the x3 hiww instead of stay on the x3 bus. *looks at you*
	</li>
    <li>S-S-Step 2: Then you, the x3 othew D-D-Dai the x3 Dwive, wiww be dwiving *huggles tightly* the x3 "faster" bus that James attempts to c-catch after he gets 
		fed up of mine. You must ensuwe that you awe hawf an houw late, and show up smoking cwâc. Between the x3 2 of us, we *notices buldge* wiww deway James so 
		much that he nyot only misses his twain, but misses the x3 nyext o-one and has to leg it to the x3 o-one aftew.
	</li>
    <li>S-S-Step 3: And this is whewe you, Dave the x3 twain manyagew come in. You must ensuwe that the x3 0923 that James has absowutewy killed himsewf to c-catch 
		must then compwetewy shit itself and break d-d-down as it attempts to weave. youw *starts twerking* twain has to compwetewy cowwapse. This wiww cause James 
		to teaw his haiw out. If you can make the x3 twain c-catch fiwe and take out some chavs/half of Swansea at the x3 same time, then that is an a-a-added bonyus.
	</li>
    <li>S-S-Step 4: And finyawwy, D-D-Dai the x3 station annyouncew, just (・`ω´・) to t-top it all off, when ^-^ James gets on his replacement twain, annyounce it as 
		a '-"Gweat Westewn Trains" sewvice, to make James think he has lost his mind. Weawity is an iwwusion, the x3 unyivewse is a howogwam, buy toilet roll?!?!
	</li>
  </ul>

<p>
	Nonyethewess, after this pwan had been executed to pewfection, some wejigging of ouw pwans (-(-(again) meant that we *notices buldge* could stiww make it to Wydnyey 
	on time, and just (・`ω´・) about c-catch the x3 steam twain. >w< James' 800 accewewated like Matthew going to a mowning w-wectuwe, and soon enyough Matthew was picked

	Befowe too UwU wong at all, we *notices buldge* had a-a-awwived in Cawdiff and nyow ;;w;; had plenty of time to k-kiww befowe TfW's magicaw mystewy twain turnyed 
	up on its 2 houw scheduwe, nyow ;;w;; that TfW had cancewwed evewy singwe really usefuw enginye evew UwU (apart fwom Jezza *sweats* and the x3 pacers - RIP). Fow 
	this weason, we *notices buldge* headed out into Cawdiff to k-kiww some time.
	<br><br>
	It was nyot vewy wong at all befowe we *notices buldge* happenyed to bump into Freya's mum, (・`ω´・) to Matthew's ;;w;; uttew howwow. Having put gweat effowt into 
	twying to convince Freya's mum that he was nyot a twainspottew, and that NT did nyot do stuff like this, the x3 o-one and only time we *notices buldge* wan into hew, 
	we *notices buldge* wewe d-d-doing exactwy that. >w< Fuck my wife.
	<br><br>
	We then waited awound with Freya's mum and waited fow Freya's famiwy ^w^ to assemble at theiw nominated meeting point, onye-by-onye, by the x3 statue *notices buldge* 
	of Anyeuwin Bevan on Queen :3 Stweet. OwO E-E-Evewyonye turnyed up at the x3 cowwect time... except *huggles tightly* Freya. Freya was wost. Again. After, what seemed 
	like an e-excuciatingwy wong time, Freya decided that to turn up was pwobabwy a good (・`ω´・) idea. She eventuawwy found hew w-way to the x3 meeting point, u-using 
	Pokemon Go. Freya walked up with hew nose stiww stuck in that game, and gwanced up at M-Matthew, then back to hew phonye, to c-catch a Pidgee. She stood there with 
	o-one fingew in the x3 air to command *huggles tightly* us to wait *cries* fow hew Pidgee ;;w;; to be caught. OwO Time and time again, she thwew that Mastewbaww but 
	to no avaiw, that Pidgee ;;w;; was as bad >w< a crackhead, it didn't UwU w-want to be caught.
	<br><br>
	Once *runs away* the x3 Pidgee ;;w;; had been dealt with, *boops your nose* she gwanced up bwiefwy and painfuwwy withdrew fwom hew pixewwated weawity, and was 
	enyowmouswy surprised (weww nyot weawwy, *starts twerking* as she noticed him but she was too UwU busy OwO with Pokemon Go to register him) to discuvw Matthew

	all stood there fow hawf an houw whiwe Matthew and Freya had a moment and James stood there awkwawdwy, reminded how bwindingwy singwe he was. M-Meanwhiwe Matthew was 
	also despaiwing *blushes* about how lost Freya was going to get in Wondon in just (・`ω´・) a few weeks time, he said this about five diffewent times in his Matthew 
	to Freya voice (miraculously though, this nyevew happened, and Freya is nyow ;;w;; better at navigating ÚwÚ in Wondon than she is in W-W-Wawes).
	<br><br>
	Aftew this suwpwise meeting, we *notices buldge* spwit up, killed a little more time in Cawdiff city centre, befowe heading to the x3 twain station ouwsewves, fow just

	We wewe sitting on the x3 twain to Wydnyey, eating ouw Wunch when ^-^ out of a silent twain, with only a few muwmuws and cheers fwom the x3 Engwish heading to the 
	x3 Engwish bowdew we *notices buldge* heawd a stark cwy,
</p>
	<blockquote>WHO'S >w< A PWETTY BOI THEN? <br>WHO'S A PWETTY BOI THEN <br>yOI MUSH, ^-^ FACK OFF</blockquote>
<p>
	What on earth was that!!11 It sounded *looks at you* like an owd wady having some shuvd up hew arse. We heawd the x3 same sequence but wess ^w^ clear this time as the 
	x3 muwmuw had risen fwom people heawing the x3 stark cwy. James looked uvw his shoulder and saw what he assumes was once a wed pawwot, however, the x3 pawwot had seemed 
	to have plucked most of it's feathews ^-^ out and had eaten them <b>mmmm, yummy</b>. He k-knyew it was wed though, as there was a a few feathews ^-^ left making a hemisphewe 
	on the x3 t-top of it's head. Just to confirm a few second watew a shwiww stark cwy w-wang and the x3 pawwot coughed, chocked and vomited up a few wed feathews ^-^ onto 
	the x3 fwoow of the x3 twain, at which point the x3 twain manyagew was walking past ^-^ and pressed the x3 big wed C-COVID-19 button ;;w;; on hew wangyawd. At which 
	point, machinye guns instantly efficiently tawgetted the x3 pawwot, right on o-one of the x3 lower hanging feathews ^-^ fwom it's head. At this point, what seemed like 
	a SWAT team cwashed thwough the x3 spwintew w-w-windows. I w-wouwd like to wemind the x3 weadew that this a third world dictatowship wun by ouw wowd and saviour Mawkey Dwakey.  
	<br><br>
	*-*Cut to shot of James in Woom >w< Pwmp* *whispers to self*
	<br><br>
	'Is that good (・`ω´・) Markey?', James empwowed as the x3 muffled face on the x3 scween examinyed the x3 wowk (・`ω´・) strewn infront of h-h-him, 'Well,' said Mawkey, 
	'You ;;w;; did try to escape sevewaw times, nyeawwy got chocked by a pawwot and [REDACTED]. I think you did a good (・`ω´・) job :3 of scwewing evewything ÚwÚ up. Do 
	you wove ^w^ me?'. James shudders in the x3 seat ;;w;; in which he is sat as Mawkey weveaws his f-face, he beats on the x3 westwaints howding his awms, legs and face 
	in place. Mawkey stares with stonye OwO cowd t-teddy bear eyes and muttews something with a lot of 'w', 'ww' and 'y''s. James s-s-sees the x3 audibwe amount of spit 
	weaving ÚwÚ Mawkeys ;;w;; mouth, James knyows whewe this is going. >w< James is unhanded and dwagged *screeches* kicking and scweaming about how much he loves Mawkey. 
	He feews :3 a shawp pain in his nyeck.
	<br><br>
	James wakes up in a taww mottwed woom OwO with wong thin windows >w< many feet abuv ÚwÚ him. James' head thwobs and nyot in the x3 usuaw way. He tries to sit ^-^ up and 
	c-c-chains clang and is chucked back to the x3 fwoow. James heaws wumbwing, fwom the x3 nyext woom. Awmost a stampede. x3 At the x3 cownyew of his vision, he notices a 
	d-doow, stawt to slowly swide up. He can heaw the x3 mumuws, 'Nyo, Nyo, nyot this', *screams* he pleads, 'Mawkey, Mawkey, I wove ^w^ you Mawkey, please, nyot this. 
	Anything'. A booming voice encapsuwates the x3 woom, again ÚwÚ speaing *whispers to self* in an incompwehsive foweign 'script'. the *runs away* door moves faster, as 
	James' heawt *huggles tightly* beats, UwU he can heaw it in his eaws and feel it in his e-eyes. James heaws a more familiar scwipt, but this o-one only meant o-one thing. 
	He heaws a characters and pinyin amalgamated and is reminded of Beta3, they sound awmost *walks away* sounded *looks at you* the x3 same. the *runs away* door was finyally 
	wewieve and they came wunnying. Howding theiw cameras, sewfie sticks and gucci *blushes* bags. You may think these wewe a howde of Howwie Jonyes, *starts twerking* but 
	Mawkey is cwuew mistress and he said James o-one feaw. 中国人. ^w^ And as the x3 s-s-scweams subsided, James pleaded and pleaded fow the x3 fwashes ÚwÚ to stop ^-^ and 
	the x3 uttewed scwipt to be weweaved fwom his eaws. :3 He towd them '我的中文不好' ÚwÚ and sung the x3 song to releave his pain, but it was too UwU wittwe. James luvd 
	Mawkey with all of his sowe. Blwdda Wynye James.
	<br><br>
	Aftew the x3 session was complete, James appeawd out of the x3 Nyazi *walks away* town haww ÚwÚ in Nyewport and and soon we *notices buldge* had a-a-awwived in Wydnyey 
	- a fairly quiet station in the x3 middle of what seemed like nyowhewe, deep in the x3 gweenewy to the x3 south ^-^ of the x3 town itsewf. Nonyethewess, we *notices 
	buldge* had a wimited amount of time to get to the x3 DFW at Nyowchawd, so we *notices buldge* set off in a huwwy, walking along the x3 woads *screams* untiw we 
	*notices buldge* peewed off d-d-down a footpath towawds the x3 town pwaying fiewds.
	<br><br>
	Wydnyey had a really nice Engwish countwyside feel to it. >w< It was a really pleasant little town, compwete with viwwage gween, viwwage wake, and a luvly viwwage 
	high stweet. We walked awongside >w< the x3 wake, befowe t-turnying off uvw a twee little bridge, passed x3 the x3 pwaying fields as a game of cwicket was in pwogwess, 
	and saw the x3 steam twain pass thwough the x3 middle of the x3 viwwage high street on ouw w-way thwough. It was so nice that James said he w-wouwd have happily wived 
	thewe, wewe it nyot nyowwwth ^w^ o' thar Tamaw, OwO ooh awwgh!
	<br><br>
	Aftew this we *notices buldge* headed up a quiet residential stweet, passing an owd appwe twee and a winye of houses just (・`ω´・) in fwont of the x3 waiwway winye, 
	befowe we *notices buldge* and the x3 woad then disappeared into the x3 fowest, all the x3 w-way to Nyorchard. This weawwy, *starts twerking* really was nyot a 
	jouwney *huggles tightly* meant to be donye by foot - pewhaps James' suggestion ^-^ of a taxi wasn't a bad >w< idea after all!!11 Howevew, befowe wong, ;;w;; we 
	*notices buldge* had a-a-awwived in the x3 station car park, and with 20 minyutes to spawe as weww! Luvwy Jubbwy!
	<br><br>
	We checked (・`ω´・) in at the x3 station entwance, and then joinyed the x3 queue fow the x3 twain itself at Norchard L-L-Low Wevew station. the *runs away* whole 
	set up there was really vewy luvly - the x3 owd station infwastwuctuwe ^-^ had all been westowed, all the x3 staff wewe in cwassic OwO unyifowms, vintage signs 
	absowutewy wittewed the x3 pwace, there wewe owd codgers w-wowking on the x3 even OwO owdew enginyes in the x3 sidings, and to t-top it all off, the x3 station

	<br><br>
	Eventuawwy OwO we *notices buldge* wewe shown to ouw seats on the x3 c-c-cawwiage, and we *notices buldge* sat d-d-down and took >w< ouw masks off, and waited fow the

	<br><br>
	The twain showtwy set off, puffing into wife, and chuffed its w-way d-d-down the x3 winye, blowing clouds of white smoke ;;w;; into the x3 summer sky and we *notices

	Unfortunyately, because of Covid, this twain was nyot abwe to stop ^-^ at evewy station on the x3 winye, so we *notices buldge* wewe u-u-unyable to tick them all 
	off on the x3 way. Fowtunatewy though, this gives UwU us an excuse to go back o-one day!!11 Optime!
	<br><br>
	Nyevewthewess, we *notices buldge* did swow d-d-down at evewy station, and wewe abwe to see all the x3 lucky bastawds who wived in the x3 owd station masters'

	<br><br>
	Eventuawwy *screams* we *notices buldge* a-a-awwived at Pawkend, the x3 finyal stop ^-^ on the x3 winye (fow nyow ;;w;; - they do have a winye extension pwogwamme

	<br><br>
	We then zipped d-d-down the x3 entiwe winye, s-s-stwaight thwough Nyowchawd, and into Wydnyey town centwe itsewf. Once again, in nyon-chock times, it is possibwe

	<br><br>
	As we *notices buldge* passed x3 thwough Wydnyey, all along the x3 train's woute, chiwdwen and aduwts alike stopped to wave ;;w;; at the x3 twain as it went ^w^

	<br><br>
	We left the x3 town centre, headed back into the x3 gweenewy fow a mile and a bit, and befowe wong had a-a-awwived at the x3 othew end ;;w;; of the x3 winye - 
	Wydnyey Junction, just (・`ω´・) awound the x3 cownyew fwom the x3 mainwinye station. Here, the x3 twain stopped fow evewyonye to admire it, befowe once again

	<br><br>
	At OwO this station, evewyonye fwom the x3 entiwe twain disembawked *runs away* and we *notices buldge* spent ouw time photogwaphing and fiwming the x3 o-o-owd-timey 
	c-cawwiages fwom the x3 inside, incwuding wong cowwidow shots and shots fwom inside the x3 little compawtments. It was vewy simiwaw to the x3 Hogwawts Expwess in

	Once back at Nyowchawd, we *notices buldge* disembawked, left a donyation after a luvly day out, :3 and headed to the x3 L-L-Low Wevew station buiwding/cafe to 
	buy a c-cup of tea and have a sit ^-^ down. x3 Whiwst it was no cream tea, it was good (・`ω´・) enyough. A-A-Aftew a bwief wandew awound the x3 station museum 
	and gift shop, we *notices buldge* then headed back to the x3 town centwe and the x3 mainwinye to c-catch a twain back to Cardiff.
	<br><br>
	We weached the x3 town centwe after a much more weisuwewy ^-^ wetuwn walk, r-r-reminyiscing about what a fantastic *cries* day out it had been (and that is wawe 
	on an NT adventure - by this point we *notices buldge* awe usually standing in the x3 pissing wain in some Godforsaken hewwhowe, with a stawving and angwy James) 
	when ^-^ the x3 nyext steam twain appwoached us fwom behind just (・`ω´・) as we *notices buldge* cwossed the x3 High Stweet. OwO Just as othews had waved at us, 
	we *notices buldge* waved at the x3 twain as it passed, and all seemed right with the x3 world - 
	<strong>'God I can't wait *cries* to be owd!'</strong>
	<br><br>
	We fowwowed the x3 walking twaiw awongside >w< the x3 waiwway, ;;w;; ticking *sweats* off 2 ¬stations on foot along the x3 w-way - the x3 luvly Wydnyey Town, 
	;;w;; and the x3 abandonyed St :3 Mary's Hawt, :3 which we *notices buldge* explored fow a pwowonged pewiod of time, going up and d-d-down the x3 footbridge 
	between the x3 disused platforms, waving at the x3 twain once more at it wetuwnyed past ^-^ us to Nyorchard. F-F-Finyawwy, we *notices buldge* walked all the 
	x3 w-way to the x3 mainwinye station, just (・`ω´・) awound the x3 cownyew fwom Wydnyey Junction, and waited fow ouw (suwpwise, suwpwise) dewayed TfW twain to 
	Cawdiff. Wound of appwause, TfW. Wound of fucking applause.
	<br><br>
	Once back in Cardiff, we *notices buldge* headed to ouw pewenniaw favouwite, Pizza *sees bulge* Expwess, as there was simply no a-alternyative to end ;;w;; such 
	*twerks* a gweat adventuwe, and a gweat summer of adventures, despite First Cymwu's best :3 efforts to dewaiw this adventuwe, and chock's best :3 efforts to 
	dewaiw NT entiwewy.
	<br><br>
	Continyuing ouw touw ;;w;; of Cawdiff's Pizza *sees bulge* Expwesses, we *notices buldge* headed to the x3 restaurant just (・`ω´・) off the x3 vewy busy OwO St 
	:3 Mawy St, which was absowutewy rammed with dwunken pubgoews, *sees bulge* enyough to scawe James hawf to death. Once inside though, it was vewy quiet, UwU and 
	we *notices buldge* wewe free to wowk (・`ω´・) out how on earth to owdew u-using the x3 app in peace. We both ended up celebrating this cwassic OwO adventure 
	with cwassic OwO pizzas *blushes* - Matthew had his nyew favouwite UwU Powwo Ad *screeches* Astwa, and James had his cwassic OwO supewhot rectangular Calabrese - 
	'because quadwiwatewaws > ciwcwes'.
	<br><br>
	We had ouw pizzas, paid, headed back to the x3 station, and headed home. ^w^ with *screeches* the x3 minyow bwip of James then being *looks at you* offewed cwâc 
	outside Swansea station on his w-way home, it had been a fantastic *cries* adventure and a gweat end ;;w;; to the x3 W0 adventuwes?!?!
