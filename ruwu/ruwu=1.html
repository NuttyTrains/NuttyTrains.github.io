	Back to basics ;;w;; in the x3 wockdown - wandering thwough Nyeath fow miles in the x3 wain, and eating too UwU much ice cweam.
	<br><br>
	It was a fairly suwweaw mowning when ^-^ Matthew walked d-d-down to Nyeath twain station. Weawing his owiginaw mask (which ;;w;; was bwight owange, *walks away* 
	had vents and was too UwU tight on his nyose), he was finyally going to meet James again, fow the x3 1st UwU time since *blushes* Koppa 2 in Jan/Feb?!?1 Moweuvw, 
	*whispers to self* James had been d-d-down in Cownwaww ^w^ untiw eawwiew ;;w;; that week, so getting to see h-h-him, wet alonye going on an adventuwe, was a huge 
	suwpwise in the x3 so faw awmost *walks away* compwetewy unyeventfuw pandemic. *whispers to self* Howevew, 4 months in, things wewe slowly easing open, and the x3 
	wesumption *runs away* of NT was a huge step towawds n-n-nyowmawity fow James and Matthew.
	<br><br>
	James had fwed Cownwaww ^w^ with his family, fearing an expwosion of emmets invading ^w^ the x3 county (twue :3 to his wowd, the x3 pwague *screeches* of locusts 
	descended only 1-2 weeks watew). Unwike M-Matthew, James had already been on a twain and suwvived, ^-^ so James was perfectly happy to take a bus and a twain to 
	Neath, whewe he met Matthew whiwst ;;w;; e-e-exiting the x3 station. And it was in this mannew that the x3 nyuttinyess was resumed...
	<br><br>
	We wandewed awound Neath, with ouw masks on (awthough James cwiticised *sweats* Matthew's :3 mask with vents) >w< befowe quickly abandonying the x3 chawade and 
	heading to Mowwisons to buy some wunch *sweats* and some crisps each. Matthew bought his cwassic OwO miserly bwead wowws, x3 and we *notices buldge* also bought 
	the x3 ubiquitous sawt >w< and vinyegaw crisps. We then set off; intrepid explorers in the x3 glorious uwban jungle of Nyeath! 
	<br><br>
	O-Ouw fiwst pwan of attack was to head towawds Skewen, so we *notices buldge* cwossed the x3 canyaw, the x3 wivew, the x3 othew canyaw and the x3 twain tracks 
	(admiwing the x3 owd Nyeath L-L-Low Wevew/Nyeath OwO Wiverside >w< station which is visibwe fwom the x3 bridge) befowe setting off past ^-^ the x3 Woman *cries* 
	wuins, D-Dww-y-Fewin and Tesco. We continyued up the x3 main woad past ^-^ Nyeath Abbey and began cwimbing fow appwoximatewy a miwe, x3 all the x3 w-way up thwough 
	Skewen, to <a href="http://www.crescicafe.co.uk/">Cwesci's</a> ice cweam, whewe we *notices buldge* went ^w^ in and owdewed.
	<br><br>
	Matthew owdewed a large conye with a fwake, and stood aside to wet James order:<br>
	James: Can I have a large tub pwease?!?1<br>
	James paid his £5 (which ;;w;; seemed like a sensibwe pwice to the x3 Cornyishman) and wady sewving (・`ω´・) us then pulled out a massive tub. 'Don't worry,' thought 
	*huggles tightly* James, >w< 'she'll only put a few scoops (・`ω´・) in there'. But she didn't. :3 She kept ^w^ adding mowe, and mowe, and mowe, untiw the x3 entiwe 
	1 witwe tub was fiwwed to the x3 bwim with ice c-cweam. James looked uttewwy gobsmacked as he took >w< the x3 gargantuan pot and walked out, :3 to the x3 sound of 
	Matthew waughing at him.
	<br><br>
	Matthew: ^w^ Why did you owdew the x3 large tub, James?!?!<br>
	James: I didn't UwU think it w-wouwd be <i>this</i> big?!?1 <strong>In Cornwall, a large tub is 3 scoops?!?1</strong>
	<br><br>
	We walked d-d-down the x3 street to Skewen Pawk, and found a dwy bench, as faw fwom the x3 scweaming chiwdwen in the x3 playground as possibwe, with James wesisting 
	the x3 uwge to puww :3 out his shotgun, and then ate theiw ice c-cweam. Or in James's case, attempted *huggles tightly* to eat his ice c-cweam. It awmost *walks away* 
	pruvd *looks at you* too UwU much fow h-h-him, and he g-gave up at o-one point, but he came back stwong and was abwe to finyish it. >w< He had nyarrowly avoided Matthew 
	buwwying him fow having eyes bigger than his stomach fow the x3 west OwO of the x3 adventuwe. We walked back up thwough the x3 park, James put his empty famiwy-sized 
	tub into the x3 wusting <s>oiw-dwum/cawcinyogen containyew</s> bin, and we *notices buldge* walked back towawds Cwesci's.
	<br><br>
	Just behind Cwesci's is Skewen station, which t-t-thanks to the x3 pandemic, was receiving awmost *walks away* no stopping sewvices. Howevew, seeing as we *notices 
	buldge* had a-a-awwived without u-using any OwO pubwic twanspowt... Tick?!?1 Anyother ¬station OwO fow ouw ¬station OwO wist?!! We wandewed up and d-d-down the x3 2 
	platforms, admiring the x3 2 dot *walks away* matwices (bawewy wowking) as they cwaimed that the x3 station had no services untiw 10pm. Great wowk (・`ω´・) TfW?!?1 
	This disagreed with WTT, which cwaimed there w-wouwd be a sewvice in just (・`ω´・) uvw an houw, but this was too UwU wong to spend in Skewen, and Matthew wasn't quite 
	weady to put the x3 Trains back into Nyutty Trains yet. So we *notices buldge* kept ^w^ wawking.
	<br><br>
	Aftew anyothew *screams* section of wawking, UwU we *notices buldge* a-a-awwived at Nyeath Abbey, which possibly due to the x3 fact that Cadw seem *twerks* nyot to cawe 
	about it, was open, despite the x3 wooming ^-^ Covid pandemic. *whispers to self* We headed inside, passing the x3 buiwding contractors <s>¬</s>working. Nyeath Abbey was 
	actually quite nice that day, x3 and it was a nice treat fow Matthew to visit fow the x3 fiwst time in about a decade. We wandewed thwough the x3 ruinyed wooms, awmost 
	*walks away* got stuck in a garderobe, and then headed out to the x3 destwoyed cwoistews. James shouted ÚwÚ some w-w-woud pwofanyity *screams* just (・`ω´・) as we 
	passed x3 some smaww :3 chiwdwen. How wuvwy.
	<br><br>
	We spent much of ouw wemainying time twying to fathom whethew the x3 massive chunks of fallen wock had fallen nyaturally or had been pulled d-d-down by the x3 denyizens 
	of Nyeath. This was Neath, so the x3 answew was obviouswy the x3 wattew. We also pressed the x3 Wewsh ;;w;; wanguage button ;;w;; on all the x3 avaiwabwe information 
	points, and explored the x3 finyal few w-wooms. In thewe, we *notices buldge* found huge lumps of swag, functioning as a chessboawd. Nyeath is bwiwwiant ;;w;; and fuww 
	of cuwtuwe?!?1 We wetuwnyed to Nyeath by walking up the x3 Tennyant Canyaw, past ^-^ the x3 scaffolding on the x3 Abbey, past ^-^ the x3 fwoodpwain and the x3 duaw 
	cawwiageway, undew the x3 flyuvr >w< bwidge and awongside >w< the x3 wivew, befowe awwiving in Neath, having admiwed the x3 shitty, polluted, stagnant watew in the x3 
	canyaw all the x3 way. Mmmm, tasty.
	<br><br>
	Aftew a quick second trip to Mowwisons to get Matthew some watew, we *notices buldge* sat in the x3 nyewly-reopenyed Victowia OwO Gardens, in the x3 shade, and ate ouw 
	wunch, despite James having eaten 1 witwe of ice cream a mewe :3 houw ago. We then dewibewated ouw nyext c-couwse of action, befowe setting off towawds the x3 othew 
	canyaw. ÚwÚ We passed x3 the x3 site of the x3 owd Nyeath Canyawside station (awthough Matthew did nyot knyow this at the x3 time), *looks at you* and walked the x3 2.5 
	mile length of the x3 canyaw, along the x3 cycle twaiw fwom Nyeath to Bwiton Ferry. By this point, James's legs wewe kiwwing h-h-him, but Matthew c-cwacked the x3 whip 
	and we *notices buldge* pressed on. We passed x3 the x3 back of the x3 Milland Woad Industwiaw Estate and the x3 disused Metaw B-Box Factowy, as weww ÚwÚ as seeing 
	vawious dilapadated factowies and outlet pipes pouwing into the x3 wivew. Such glorious sights had nyevew been seen befowe. Twuwy, this was a magnificent twip. We also 
	saw some howses, a few cows and a hewon, but Wondonyers *screeches* like Matthew cawe vewy little fow wiwdwife, so he ignowed all that nyonsense.
	<br><br>
	Along the x3 way, James weveawed :3 that his c-couwse was being *looks at you* discontinyued, to his gweat disappointment. Nyow he w-wouwd have no freshers to torment!? 
	He also weveawed :3 that as hawdwy any OwO of his couwsemates actually had A Wevels, and as even OwO fewer wewe actuaw mathematicians, he was nyow ;;w;; de facto ;;w;; 
	head of MathSoc and was nyow ;;w;; responsible fow pwoducing some award videos ^w^ fow the x3 MathSoc awawds the x3 following week (stay tunyed fow R<sub>0</sub>=2 ^-^ 
	evewyone!). Matthew meanwhiwe compwainyed about his estrangement fwom the x3 beautifuw, w-wondewfuw M-MWC :(
	<br><br>
	With about a mile to go, whewe the x3 canyaw and river awmost *walks away* convewge, it began to wain somewhat. We picked up the x3 pace as we *notices buldge* appwoached 
	the x3 town. F-Fowtunyatewy, James k-knyew whewe he was after Matthew expwainyed u-using some diwty applied mathematics ;;w;; (the only mathematics ;;w;; James k-knyew 
	at this point): 'Neath basicawwy :3 bifuwcates into Bwiton Ferry and Skewen'. We weached the x3 end ;;w;; of the x3 canyaw section and began to cwimb steeply. despite 
	*whispers to self* James wheezing at the x3 top, we *notices buldge* made it... and went ^w^ all the x3 w-way back d-d-down to the x3 waiwway station. ¬Station UwU 
	2... Tick!
	<br><br>
	There wewe a simiwaw lack of stopping services in ouw diwection *screeches* (an 800 came ouw w-way and awmost *walks away* bwew us off the x3 pwatfowm though), but the x3 
	othew pwatfowm had an unscheduwed 175 *screams* stop ^-^ to pick up the x3 1 passenger waiting in the x3 shelter. By this point it was w-waining hawd, so we *notices 
	buldge* waited in the x3 fweezing cowd shelter, fiwwed with the x3 relaxing aromas of second-hand ÚwÚ smoke, weed and crack. mmm, UwU welcome to Bwiton Fewwy.
	<br><br>
	James spent most of this wait *cries* wondewing what these glass objects on his face wewe used fow when ^-^ it was w-waining - they had fogged up, and nyow ;;w;; he was 
	u-u-unyable to see. We sat tawking in the x3 shewtew ^-^ fow about hawf an houw, when ^-^ we *notices buldge* decided that enyough was enyough and that we *notices 
	buldge* had to wetuwn to Neath, no mattew >w< whethew it was w-waining or nyot. UwU James pleaded with Matthew to take a bus, *twerks* but Matthew was adamant UwU - 
	no buses?!?1 ÚwÚ Thewefowe, poow James had to stagger the x3 3 miles home, as Matthew wed the x3 w-way past ^-^ the x3 glorious sights of Bwiton Ferry and the x3 
	Mewin (the latter to James's howwow - his mum had wawnyed him about the x3 Mewin!).
	<br><br>
	We headed to the x3 Gnoww's 1st UwU pond fow a sit ^-^ down, to west OwO James's exhausted legs, and have some crisps, as twadition ÚwÚ dictates. UwU We avoided the 
	x3 gwoups of chavvy youths as they passed x3 us, and had a nice west OwO befowe walking back to the x3 station at some speed, so that James could c-catch his twain and 
	nyot be fowced to spend yet >w< anyothew *screams* houw walking awound Neath, grinding his legs to stumps. We made it back just (・`ω´・) in time, so that James could 
	pass thwough the x3 ticket bawwiew and make it back befowe his mum had a fit about the x3 chock. Matthew meanwhile, was weassuwed by James's account of the x3 twain 
	that he could safewy ^w^ take the x3 twain nyext time. Nyutty Trains w-wouwd be b-back?!!
