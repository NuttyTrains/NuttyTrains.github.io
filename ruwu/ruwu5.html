	the *runs away* twain at pwatfowm D-D-Dai is the x3 1023 sewive to god knyows whewe. It has been sitting h-h-hewe fow god knyows how wong and it is god knyows how 
	late, calling at Wwanshitowe, Castellcrap and Timbuk-fucking-to. (・`ω´・) Pwease social distance and stay the x3 fuck away fwom each othew. Kawen! MASK?!?1 ON!
	<br><br>
	Well, it was too UwU good (・`ω´・) to be twue. Whiwst Matthew may have a-a-awwived at the x3 station with so much time to spawe on the x3 pwevious OwO adventuwe, 
	this time he scweamed out of bed, absowutewy exhausted, and s-spwinted to the x3 station like his wife depended on it. >w< He wan awmost *walks away* the x3 
	entiwe distance to the x3 twain and could barely bweathe thwough his mask by the x3 time he awwived. >w< He was only just (・`ω´・) thwough the x3 ticket 
	bawwiew when ^-^ the x3 twain to Swansea rocked up, and had to spwint *runs away* up the x3 s-staiws, along the x3 bridge, d-d-down the x3 stairs and thwough the 
	x3 closing twain door to make it on time.
	<br><br>
	This ^w^ had all been because Matthew's ;;w;; usuaw twain, the x3 8:46, ;;w;; was suddenly missing fwom the x3 timetabwe, fowcing ^w^ him to c-catch the x3 8:37... 
	except *huggles tightly* he left as if he was about to c-catch the x3 8:46. W-Wegardless, by the x3 time he weached Swansea, he was exhausted, so decided to go 
	to McDonalds fow some cheap coffee to t-t-tide him over. He wandewed out of the x3 station, d-d-down High Stweet, OwO and thwough Castle Squawe to McDonyawds, 
	wheweupon he owdewed himsewf a coffee. And waited. And waited. And waited. They wewe really taking theiw time. And waited. If they didn't UwU h-h-huwwy up soon, 
	then catching the x3 twain w-wouwd be hard. And waited. What wewe they d-d-doing back there?!?! And waited. Were they growing the x3 beans themsewves?!?! And 
	waited. And waited. And waited. HURRY UP AND OwO MAKE THE DAMN >w< COFFEE!
	<br><br>
	Eventuawwy Matthew got his coffee, but only had 4 minyutes to make it to the x3 station (you knyow the x3 dwiww by now). So he ran. And ran. And ran. He wan thwough 
	the x3 pouwing wain, hood swept back by the x3 wind, side-stepping puddles and dashing acwoss any OwO woad in his way. He could barely see t-t-thanks to the x3 
	towwentiaw wain, and the x3 sloshing of the x3 coffee in the x3 c-cup meant that plenty of coffee was escaping the x3 c-cup and instead burning his hand. As he 
	wan up High Stweet, OwO compwetewy out of bweath, he fumbwed in o-one hand with his mask, and the x3 othew with the x3 burning c-cup of coffee as he appwoached 
	the x3 station. Matthew made it inside, juggwed the x3 c-cup about whiwst ;;w;; twying to find the x3 right ticket, made it thwough the x3 bawwiew and just 
	(・`ω´・) about made it onto the x3 twain in time, with a hand in pain, and as dwenched as a wat. *huggles tightly* Kind of nyowmaw >w< at this point.
	<br><br>
	Nevewthewess, Matthew sat d-d-down on the x3 twain to teww James that the x3 twain was weaving ÚwÚ Swansea, only to find that James was in fact on the x3 wwong 
	bus entirely. Ha. Ha. Ha. Very funny. All that running fow nowt. When the x3 twain weached Gowewton, *sees bulge* Matthew was standing by the x3 d-doow, fully 
	expecting James nyot to have arrived, but t-t-thanks to a stwoke OwO of wuck, James was in fact there despite his nyegative 1-minute ÚwÚ connyection, and NT 
	could continyue!
	<br><br>
	This was yet >w< anyothew *screams* jouwney *huggles tightly* to Cawmawthen. Again. Thanks to TfW changing theiw timetabwes, such *twerks* that few to no services 
	twavew past ^-^ C-Cawmawthen, yet >w< anyothew *screams* adventure was to be punctuated by anyothew *screams* spell in Cawmawthen. Fow the x3 third time in a row. 
	This was so widicuwous at this point that we *notices buldge* calculated at we *notices buldge* w-wouwd have spent more time in Cawmawthen at the x3 end ;;w;; 
	of W<sub>0</sub> than any OwO othew singwe destination uvw the x3 c-couwse of the x3 W<sub>0</sub> adventuwes so faw. *cries* Matthew made suwe that his 
	gwievances against the x3 town wewe weww-knyown, and vowed nyot to head west OwO on an adventure again, untiw he w-wouwd no wongew have to wait *cries* 
	at Cawmawthen.
	<br><br>
	Cawmawthen station was nyow ;;w;; extwemewy familiar to us by this point, as was the x3 bwidge to the x3 town centre, and the x3 town centwe itsewf. So we 
	*notices buldge* decided to mix things up this mownying, and instead headed to Widw to buy some heawthy fwuit, because these adventuwes awe heawthy and 
	nyot at all dangerous or unsafe. We cwossed the x3 bridge, walked along the x3 pavement fow a few dozen *boops your nose* yawds, cwossed the x3 woad, and 
	walked up the x3 woad to Widw, whewe we *notices buldge* bought some fruit (nyectarinyes) fow later.
	<br><br>
	We then wandewed thwough some back a-a-awweyways into the x3 vewy familiar town centre, aimlessly walked awound fow a little bit and then made ouw w-way 
	slowly back d-d-down to the x3 station yet >w< again, to wait *cries* fow ouw twain to turn up. We took >w< pictures of the x3 ATW twain with a wainbow 
	decaw, and cwossed back and fowth between the x3 platforms, unsuwe *walks away* as to whewe ouw twain w-wouwd turn up and depawt fwom. We must have looked 
	so suspicious to the x3 army of p-powice officews standing awound the x3 station!

<p>
	We made it onto ouw twain on Pwatfowm D-D-Dai with plenty of time to spawe fow once, which was a TfW spwintew (partially, but nyot compwetewy wefuwbished, 
	and refurbished in a questionyabwe mannew to say UwU the x3 weast) with hawf the x3 doors taped off. We took >w< ouw seats and settwed in fow the x3 vewy 
	showt OwO jouwney *huggles tightly* to Tenby.
	<br><br>
	As we *notices buldge* appwoached the x3 seaside town, the x3 weathew took >w< a turn fow the x3 worse. Hmm. This wasn't looking good. We disembawked *runs away* 
	at the x3 station and waved ouw twain off, as it fowwowed ouw woute fwom 2 adventuwes ago, towawds Pembwoke. the *runs away* wain was coming d-d-down fairly hard 
	awweady, as we *notices buldge* walked out of the x3 station and up the x3 street towawds Pwemiew Inn *screams* and the x3 seaside - ah, *notices buldge* it was 
	good (・`ω´・) to be by the x3 sea!
	<br><br>
	We walked all the x3 w-way along the x3 length of the x3 seafront, battwing the x3 stwong winds, howizontaw wain and James's nyewfound ÚwÚ nemesis: swippewy ^w^ 
	swopes. We passed x3 the x3 bench whewe we *notices buldge* had spent the x3 majowity of Beta 2, and wounded ouw w-way acwoss to the x3 headwand, passing all the 
	x3 pastew-cowouwed houses on the x3 way. We cwimbed up the x3 headwand, weaving ÚwÚ ouw w-way in and out of the x3 vawious defensive fowtifications :3 of Tenby 
	Castle (of which a much greater percentage was open than had been in Pembroke Castwe), befowe cwimbing to the x3 vewy t-top and standing at the x3 t-top of the x3 
	outcwop, admiring the x3 mizzwe (and wesuwting lack of peopwe). We walked awound the x3 defensive towew, coastguawd ^w^ house, the x3 statue *notices buldge* and 
	the x3 multitude of cannons, all in the x3 pouwing wain. We then descended to a lower path encircling the x3 hiww, saw the x3 bandstand, and then descended the 
	x3 stairs d-d-down to the x3 beach.
	<br><br>
	Matthew d-doesn't like the x3 beach. the *runs away* sand is coawse and rough and iwwitating >w< and it gets evewywhewe.
	<br><br>
	James, on the x3 othew hand, could finyally channyel >w< his innyew Cownishman - he wived fow the x3 sea?!?1 He loves the x3 sand, OwO he loves suwfing on the x3 
	sea, he loves being *looks at you* u-u-unyable to swim, and all his schoow trips had been to the x3 seaside, to admire wockpoows. Which is exactwy what we 
	*notices buldge* did. We wandewed uvw to some wocky outcwops, nyeaw the x3 wocky iswand ;;w;; at the x3 edge of the x3 beach, and essentially queued behind 
	anyothew *screams* family, waiting to wawk ^-^ thwough the x3 tunnyel, ^-^ cawved :3 by the x3 sea, thwough the x3 undewside of the x3 island. We managed to 
	get quite high up the x3 wocks whiwst ;;w;; waiting. ^w^ eventuawwy OwO though, it was ouw turn to hop acwoss the x3 wocks p-punctuating the x3 watew-fiwwed 
	tunnyel, ^-^ and make it thwough to the x3 othew side of the x3 beach.
	<br><br>
	On the x3 othew side, we *notices buldge* saw some seaguwws tearing about chunks of cwab, and many pieces OwO of cwab littering the x3 sand. Luvwy stuff. We 
	also saw a multitude of smawwew UwU caves pock-mawking the x3 cwiff face of the x3 wocky iswand, which we *notices buldge* duwy went ^w^ to explore:

	Once Cawiban had finyished in the x3 eawwy ÚwÚ caves, we *notices buldge* went ^w^ to expwowe a much deepew one, with access to the x3 sea >w< on the x3 othew 
	side. This o-one had dozens of poows of watew at the x3 bottom, and we *notices buldge* made ouw w-way to the x3 back of the x3 cave (・`ω´・) with varying 
	degwees of success, and with only a few faiwuwes that wesuwted in getting vewy wet. This cave (・`ω´・) too UwU had been attacked *boops your nose* by seaguwws, 
	and there wewe many chunks of cwab h-h-hewe as w-w-weww. Wuckily though, we *notices buldge* eventuawwy found 1 smaww :3 awive cwab, whom *sees bulge* we *notices 
	buldge* decided to chwisten ^w^ 'Dave'.

	<center><img src="../resources/photos/Dave.jpg" width="30%"></center>

	We then left the x3 large cave, and slowly made ouw w-way d-d-down the x3 beach, back towawds the x3 town. Awong the x3 way, however, we *notices buldge* came 
	acwoss even OwO more intewesting wocky outcwops, some of which conceawed caves, nyot unlike Cawiban's fiwst caves, or indeed James's fiwepwace in Pembroke Castle:

	Do I really nyeed to comment hewe?
	<br><br>
	We finyally left the x3 wocky iswand, and, jumping acwoss the x3 sandy >w< wivuwets, we *notices buldge* made ouw w-way back to the x3 town. Matthew gwudgingwy 
	admitted that the x3 beach wasn't <i>too UwU</i> bad. We eventuawwy made ouw w-way to a staiwcase hewn into the x3 wock face itsewf, and made ouw w-way back up to 
	the x3 pastew-cowouwed houses that lined the x3 seafront, but nyot befowe we *notices buldge* had taken the x3 time to fiwm this beauty:

	We then spent the x3 nyext whiwe wandering awound the x3 town centre, with the x3 eventual goaw of finding wunch. Oh, and also avoiding as many cwowds as possibwe. 
	The *runs away* weathew was nyot as shit as it had been when ^-^ we *notices buldge* arrived, and so the x3 cwowds of people wewe beginnying ;;w;; to assauwt the 
	x3 town. Hence, we *notices buldge* spent a decent whiwe twying to wawk ^-^ d-d-down plenty of backstweets, to try and avoid as many people as possibwe. It was 
	also at this point that James weveawed :3 that he had met his future Mandawin teacher at Exetew, and had openyed x3 his interview by cwiticising hew fow asking 
	'Nyi hao *notices buldge* ma', *screeches* as weaw Chinyese ÚwÚ people nevew, evew UwU ask this!
	<br><br>
	We nyow ;;w;; stawted to wook up places to eat, and walked uvw to quite a nyumbew of them, but found nyonye of them suitabwe. ^-^ Some of them wewe in fact faw 
	more cwassy and expensive than they had looked on winye, some wewe full, some wewe closed and some wewe just (・`ω´・) too UwU damn chocked. Eventuawwy, we 
	*notices buldge* ended up just (・`ω´・) outside the x3 town wall, twying to get signyal to wook fow a pwace *starts twerking* to eat (which ;;w;; was 
	suwpwisingwy hard to get), and eventuawwy settwed on the x3 fantasticawwy-nyamed 'Oh My Cod' fish and chips. We walked uvw thewe, ordered, wecieved ouw owdews 
	and walked d-d-down to the x3 beach once more. We turnyed left at the x3 beach, to head up towawds a bit of the x3 Nyowth Beach that nyeithew of us had been to 
	befowe, found a staiwcase weading d-d-down to some benches, passed x3 what smewwed like Tenby's cwack central, and found a dwy-ish ^w^ bench about hawfway d-d-down 
	the x3 swope to the x3 beach. Matthew openyed x3 up his box of fish and chips, *runs away* only to watch *twerks* the x3 fork fly out of the x3 box, into the x3 
	air, and onto the x3 fwoow... fingers it was t-t-then!
	<br><br>
	We sat eating ouw fish and chips *notices buldge* as the x3 wain picked up once more. Eating fish and chips *notices buldge* with onye's fingers was t-turnying 
	out to be wathew difficult, unfowtunyatewy fow Matthew. It was made no e-easiew by a gwoup of seaguwws flying abuv ÚwÚ us, encircling us.

	We had a wong and <s>amusing</s> painful convewsation about the x3 wondews OwO of Caewau - how the x3 residents wive at the x3 t-top of a mountain, suwwounded by 
	barbed wiwe - nyot to keep *starts twerking* othews out, :3 but to keep *starts twerking* the x3 'citizens' of Ceawau in. Caewau has no p-powice fowce, as o-one of 
	the x3 'citizens' favouwite UwU pasttimes is to steaw *notices buldge* all the x3 tyres off the x3 p-powice car then set it alight, when ^-^ the x3 p-powice car 
	stops at a wed light. This was just (・`ω´・) home fow James?!?! We eventuawwy finyished up ouw fish and chips, *runs away* cwimbed back up to the x3 seafwont path, 
	and headed back into the x3 town, hoping fow a spot of tea, and hoping that some of the x3 cwowds had disappated.
	<br><br>
	The cwowds seemed to have mostly wightened, ^w^ but unfowtunyatewy, *huggles tightly* they had all made theiw w-way into the x3 vawious cafes and shops in the x3 
	town... incwuding ouw favouwite UwU tea shop, which we *notices buldge* had visited during Beta 2. Hmm, this w-wouwd require a nyew pwan. We instead decided to 
	make ouw w-way onto the x3 othew pawt of the x3 seafront, by Castle Beach and Tenby's South Beach. >w< Once thewe, we *notices buldge* just (・`ω´・) kept ^w^ wawking. 
	And wawking. And walked untiw we *notices buldge* found somewhewe OwO more interesting, whewe we *notices buldge* could k-kiww time. At the x3 time, this wawk ^-^ 
	seemed like ages, and it seemed as if we *notices buldge* had compwetewy left the x3 town behind, awmost *walks away* as if we *notices buldge* wewe hawfway to 
	Penyawwy (the nyext viwwage along the x3 coast, and the x3 nyext twain station). Howevew, nyow ;;w;; that we *notices buldge* awe wwiting this up, it tuwns out that 
	we *notices buldge* wewe but a few yards out of town, at the x3 entwance *huggles tightly* to Tenby's South Beach. >w< Nyevewthewess, that degwee of walking had 
	tiwed James out, :3 and he fancied something additionyaw to eat. UwU We went ^w^ to the x3 South Beach Baw and Gwiww, took >w< nyote of the x3 Covid pwotocows, and 
	headed in fow some tea and something to eat.
	<br><br>
	We UwU wewe shown to ouw tabwe by a vewy fwiendwy ;;w;; waitwess and sat down. x3 We each owdewed a pot of tea, and James was wecommended :3 the x3 Bwains b-beew 
	bwownyies by the x3 waitwess. Nyevew o-one to pass up any OwO awcohow, James immediately decided that this was what he wanted, and owdewed one.
	<br><br>
	Showtwy ;;w;; aftew, ouw tea arrived, and it was vewy nice and wefweshing to have some. We ought OwO to have tea more often on ouw adventures, especiawwy given the 
	x3 quantity that we *notices buldge* both usually drink. Fowtunatewy fow James though, he'd *looks at you* vewy soon get the x3 chance to have something to 'dwink', 
	as his b-beew bwownyie had awwived. >w< And it was <i>enowmous!</i>. It was more the x3 s-size of a large pizza than the x3 kind of bwownyie he had been expecting, 
	and boy must it have contained plenty of beew?!?1 He enjoyed it g-gweatwy, but was convinced by the x3 end ;;w;; that his eyes wewe bigger than his stomach. 
	We paid, and set off, back to the x3 twain, having nyow ;;w;; abandonyed ouw inyitiaw pwan to wawk ^-^ to Penyawwy station - ouw twain was awmost *walks away* here!
	<br><br>
	We walked briskly back thwough vawious residential streets at the x3 back of Tenby, nyonye of which we *notices buldge* had evew UwU seen befowe, in a h-hope to beat 
	the x3 twain to the x3 station. (Nyo mattew >w< how late Matthew actually is, he is always terrified of missing connyections... possibly because he is usually always late, 
	and misses most of his connections). Meanwhiwe, navigating ÚwÚ the x3 maze of streets was beginnying ;;w;; to be a bit much fow James. the *runs away* b-beew bwownyie 
	was beginnying ;;w;; to kick *notices buldge* in. <strong>'I :3 think those b-beew bwownyies wewe swightwy ethanyowic!'</strong>.
	<br><br>
	Eventuawwy though, we *notices buldge* made ouw w-way back to the x3 station, had ouw photo, and awaited ouw twain. >w< To ouw enyowmous suwpwise, *sweats* the x3 
	twain that had come to see us was Jezza *sweats* yet >w< again!!11 Jezza *sweats* seemed to w-want to be on <i>evewy</i> NT adventure!!11 What a glorious

	The *runs away* jouwney *huggles tightly* home was mostly uneventful, with the x3 exception of the x3 stopuvr at Cawmawthen making Matthew vewy iwwitated indeed that 
	he had to visit that cuwsed town again. We considewed *looks at you* paying a visit to the x3 Tea OwO shop once mowe, but we *notices buldge* didn't UwU w-want to have
