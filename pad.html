      <p>
      When we were initially drawing up our list of stations, life was really, really easy - we just noted them down in the order we visited them, and Bob's 
      your uncle. However, when the scope of our adventures progressed from a couple of ad hoc visits to shitty valleys or picturesque country lines, past 
      visiting all the stations within South Wales or Wales, and onto visiting every single NR station in the UK, suddenly the way in which we enumerated 
      and kept track of stations began to matter. Fortunately, we were still confined to South Wales, where we could more or less keep track of them 
      mentally - these were our local railways, and we were becoming somewhat experts about the rolling stock, service patterns, stations and even history. 
      <br><br>
      This changed when we reached London, which is a far different beast. We had already had to strip the 3 tube stations (enumerated 1, 1a & 1b) out of 
      our list of NR stations so as to ensure that we kept an accurate count of our NR stations, which led to the creation of a separate table for tube 
      stations. Fantastic. However, when drawing up the rules for London stations, ahead of our first London adventure, Matthew started to get concerned 
      as to how subtle and nuanced a lot of the distinctions between stations could be. This is why the rules for the London adventures have to be listed 
      in such greater detail.
      <br><br>
      Firstly, only London Underground, DLR, London Overground and TfL Rail/Crossrail/Elizabeth line stations qualify under London rules. When 
      complete, we ought to have visited a total of 270 London Underground, 45 DLR, 112 London Overground and 41 Elizabeth Line stations, 
      although this number is subject to change as new stations are constructed and added to the network. Initially, we thought it would be amusing to add 
      all the stations together into an enormous TfL list, but after Ï™3, Matthew decided that this would in fact be impossible, and that a new approach was 
      needed. Hence, in order to ensure that we complete all the stations on each of the networks, Matthew divided up the TfL stations table.
      <br><br>
      We will double-count Overground and Elizabeth line stations as NR stations, meaning they will appear in both tables. Our methodology for counting DLR, 
      and Elizabeth line stations is straightforward and our methodology for counting Overground stations is also simple, except we shall also count 
      Battersea Park, as it qualifies as an Overground station, despite not appearing on the map. As for tube stations, to reach the full 270, we will follow 
      the customary methodology of counting Bank and Monument separately, and double-counting Edgware Road, Hammersmith and Paddington. 
      <br><br>
      Addendum: I am quite proud that I pre-empted Geoff here with my note on Paddington. Clearly he has read this website!
