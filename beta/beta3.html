	The reader may be left slightly confused here. Oystermouth Castle is nowhere near a train station. In fact, James didn't travel 
	on a single train all day! James has something to say in his defense about this adventure's inclusion -  Bu Hao Mao!<br><br>
	Later that summer, Matthew came down to Swansea to visit James. They met at the train station, and started walking. We walked 
	through the city centre, and out into Uplands, passing Ffynone (cue reminiscing). Upon this, we decided to start following the 
	route we'd taken during one of our escapades down to the seafront during study leave for GCSEs. We wandered down all the dodgy 
	alleyways, laughing insanely at what we'd been up to in school. When we got to the steep hill leading down to the seafront from 
	Brynmill, we changed course and headed towards the university, where we used to play sports on a Monday. When we got near, we 
	decided to get lost in Sketty instead, but not quite as lost as the yellow bus we saw, which was on its way to Southhampton. To 
	this day, we maintain that the bus was drunk and should go home! We then got lost in Sketty, until we reached the Clyne Valley Park. 
	We decided that this was a much better place to get lost in, and quickly achieved this. We walked to the top of the highest hill we 
	could find, narrowly avoiding being run over by a gang of BMX riders, before heading to the seafront at last. We stopped for tea 
	at Ripples, then walked all the way to Mumbles. When we arrived, we headed up to Oystermouth Castle, paid the entrance fee, and started 
	exploring.

	So far, the reader can be forgiven for assuming that we must be idiots to include this amongst other NT adventures. But it was 
	here, more than anywhere else, that our level of nuttiness metamorphosed from normal nutty to having completely lost our minds.<br><br>
	A large group of Chinese tourists arrived as we were talking to the curator on the desk. He called to the tourists to come and 
	pay, and started gesturing the same thing. In response, they merely took pictures of him on their iPhones and kept walking and 
	snapping. Matthew didn't want to have to interact with people, so we continued on our tour, but eventually we reached the staircase 
	to the battlements, something we had been looking forward to very much. However, we reached it at exactly the same time as the 
	tourists. We managed to get up, but when it was time to come down, it was impossible, as the staircase was now blocked. They were 
	pushing and shoving, and there was no way to penetrate the crowd. What were we going to do? <br><br>
	At this point, something broke in both Matthew and James, and they used their knowledge of Chinese to politely ask the tourists to 
	move (James is fluent in Chinese, Spanish and Bad Latin<sup>TM</sup>). James shouted "BU HAO MAO!" to the tourists, as they turned 
	to look at us. "Bu hao mao?" he asked the closest one. "Bu hao mao? Bu Hao Mao? BU HAO MAO!". At this point, the crowd parted like the 
	Red Sea, and we quickly fled the castle, rolling about with laughter. Something also snapped in Matthew, who decided to down the 
	motte far too quickly, with madness in his eyes, as we talked about James proliferating his new Bad Latin<sup>TM</sup> language 
	amongst the plebs in Camborne. He was going to corrupt them, and see how much they could corrupt the language. After getting lost in 
	a small patch of forest, we re-emerged by the seafront, and started to walk back to the train station, after a thoroughly satisfying 
	adventure.

	After this adventure, Î²3, there was no going back. The nuttiness line had been irrevocably broken. It was time for real NT to begin!
