	Yes, we'd been to Bath before, but why not do it again? <br>
	On our previous Bath trip, (Î±I) James had been unable to visit the Roman baths, so we decided to head back to Bath in the Easter 
	holidays for a day out. We caught a train to Cardiff Central, and then changed to a GWR service to Portsmouth Harbour. We 
	stopped at Severn Tunnel Junction (our favourite station at the time), and then headed through Bristol to Bath Spa. 
	<br><br>
	It was very enjoyable to be back. We immediately headed into town, towards the Roman Baths, going to explore the whole thing. 
	Unfortunately, it was far more expensive than we thought. This was a problem. We went to the giftshop instead, whilst we tried to 
	figure out what to do next. After this, James's card clearly said he'd bought something in the Roman Baths, which was a problem,  
	seeing as he was "in Carmarthen". James bought a book of Latin insults. How lovely. Once we'd finished, 
	we headed out into Bath again. We wandered around the city centre, admiring the old buildings and fancy shops. We walked around 
	Parade Gardens, then along the River Avon. We walked up to Pulteney Bridge, and visited an antique map store for over half an hour, 
	as it was Matthew's idea of heaven. We then retraced our footsteps from our previous adventure, and ended up in the same 5* Indian restaurant. 
	James was completely shocked by the dodgy alleyway entrance, but was enamoured by the murals and glass domes of the interior. 
	We enjoyed very much.

	It was still only early afternoon, so on a whim, we wandered up towards Bathwick Hill and caught the UniBus. We arrived in Bath Uni, 
	and started to wander around the campus. We got lost in the maths department, attempted to break into the library, and laughed at the 
	lack of arts students. Towards the end of the central walkway, we turned up into the forest behind the uni, and became thoroughly lost 
	(laughing at things and getting very lost are now running jokes between us). We later found our way back down the hill, and arrived 
	amongst the student accommodation, before walking back to the bus. The bus pulled up at the train station, and we ran inside, as it was 
	starting to rain, and the train was about to leave. We decided to catch an earlier train to Temple Meads, to try and outpace our train to 
	Cardiff. As soon as we stepped onboard, the heavens opened, and the city was pounded from above by the heaviest rain either of us 
	had ever heard, before or since. 
	<br><br>
	Unfortunately, our slow, stopping train was ushered into a siding not far from Temple Meads, to allow the faster train to Cardiff to 
	pass. Bugger. When we finally arrived in Bristol, our train to Cardiff was about to leave... so we sprinted down the stairs, through the 
	tunnel, and made it just in time (luckily, the train was delayed, so we needn't have run). We took the train all the way to Cardiff. 
	<br><br>
	The train terminated there, so we got off and walked through the city centre. Neither of us had been to Cardiff often before, so we didn't 
	really know where we were going, and this wasn't helped by the ubiquitous construction work. On our meandering journey through Cardiff, 
	we amused ourselves by counting the number of Greggs that we saw. We found our way to a Starbucks, ordered tea, and sat upstairs, 
	watching the weather get steadily worse. Time ticked down, and we realised we had left it too late to sensibly catch our train. 
	Unfortunately, Matthew was there, so we instead decided to listen to Matthew, and sprint with boiling cups of tea, through the pouring 
	rain, all the way to the station. We cut our way through streets, threw ourselves down staircases, and Matthew screamed "cease thine 
	tirade, infernal telescreen!" at James's phone every time it gave us directions. We actually managed to reach the station on time, 
	which was fortunate, seeing as all subsequent trains had been cancelled due to the weather. We triumphantly boarded our 3rd Class 800 
	of the day, dripping wet, and set off home. 
	<br><br>
	On the way, James brought out his new purchase, and read out loudly from his book all the beautifully withering insults contained 
	within. Which was worse - the insults themselves or the glares of parents and grandparents seated in the quiet carriage alongside us?
	Nope, it was definitely the insults. We arrived home in the early evening, after our first adventure together as a pair, and 
	having set the tone for adventures to come.
