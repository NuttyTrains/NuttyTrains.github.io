	Visiting Bath in Spring 2018 had been nice, but it was planned far too well. In early July 2018, we decided to plan a far more 
	impromptu trip to Tenby, our first westward journey. Matthew took the train from Neath, whilst James caught the train at Gowerton. 
	the train then hugged the Dyfed coastline as we travelled deep into Carmarthenshire. Screw GWR with their functioning trains. 
	It was time to head into Pacerland<sup>TM</sup>.
	<br><br>
	We had a taste of things to come when our train terminated at Carmarthen (which is quite a long detour from the main track). 
	Carmarthen has no footbridge, so we had to cross the tracks directly, over a plastic gangway. This was nutty. Then, our new train 
	arrived. Our first pacer. How unprepared we were for the glory of pacers. All the way down, it shook violently on its poorly-designed 
	chassis, and screamed violently every time the breaks were applied. We headed deeper into West Wales, and then turned down the 
	Pembroke Dock branch line, passing Whitland, Narberth (where James regaled Matthew with his mother's tale of woe at having to walk 
	3 miles from the station to the actual village), and passed our first request stops, which was a novel concept to us both. 
	<br><br>
	Finally, we arrived in Tenby, and disembarked along with many holiday makers. We walked up the hill to the town, passing the Premier Inn, 
	and arrived at the seafront. We wandered down the seafront, and found a nice bench overlooking the sea. We had both missed the sea 
	air. We sat there, reminiscing about the past for a long time. During the course of the day, we walked the full length of the 
	promenade numerous times, walked down to the marina, went to the sheltered cove, down to the sea via some old steps, and somehow 
	managed to leave the town centre entirely, making it to a petrol station by the railway viaduct, at the bottom of the hill. This 
	was one of Matthew's first demonstrations of his amazing talent at ending up in a miserable place, no matter how lovely that place is 
	meant to be. We explored the town centre that day, wandered around the indoor market, had fish and chips, ice cream, and had tea 
	in a cosy tea shop, which was very nice. By late afternoon, we were ready to leave, so headed back to the station to thoroughly explore it.

	Our train turned up soon after, and to our surprise, it was a GWR HST. We had inadvertantly managed to catch one of GWR's 
	rare summer services all the way to Tenby. We hopped on, grateful for the comfort in comparison to the pacer that morning. 
	We alighted the train at Swansea and Neath, whilst it continued all the way to Paddington. β2 was a real turning point for NT. 
	For the first time, our adventure had given equal weightings to the journey and the destination, which by the ϡ adventures, 
	had been taken to its illogical extreme.
