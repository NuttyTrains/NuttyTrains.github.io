  <p>The Beta Adventures were the second class of adventures, now that both of us had been on the train more often, and we decided 
	to organise our own trips to places. Here, some of the classic traits of NT were first developed - running for trains, 
	visiting dodgy places, getting lost, laughing at things, and finally, turning up the nuttiness to 11.</p>
  </div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">  βI: The 2<sup>nd</sup> Bath Trip  </button>
<div class="content">
<p> Yes, we'd been to Bath before, but why not do it again? <br>
On our previous Bath trip, (αI) James had been unable to visit the Roman baths, so we decided to head back to Bath in the Easter 
holidays for a day out. We caught a train to Cardiff Central, and then changed to a GWR service to Portsmouth Harbour. We 
stopped at Severn Tunnel Junction (our favourite station at the time), and then headed through Bristol to Bath Spa. <br><br>
It was very enjoyable to be back. We immediately headed into town, towards the Roman Baths, going to explore the whole thing. 
Unfortunately, it was far more expensive than we thought. This was a problem. We went to the giftshop instead, whilst we tried to 
figure out what to do next. After this, James's card clearly said he'd bought something in the Roman Baths, which was a problem,  
seeing as he was "in Carmarthen". James bought a book of Latin insults. How lovely. Once we'd finished, 
we headed out into Bath again. We wandered around the city centre, admiring the old buildings and fancy shops. We walked around 
Parade Gardens, then along the River Avon. We walked up to Pulteney Bridge, and visited an antique map store for over half an hour, 
as it was Matthew's idea of heaven. We then retraced our footsteps from our previous adventure, and ended up in the same 5* Indian restaurant. 
James was completely shocked by the dodgy alleyway entrance, but was enamoured by the murals and glass domes of the interior. 
We enjoyed very much. <br><br>
It was still only early afternoon, so on a whim, we wandered up towards Bathwick Hill and caught the UniBus. We arrived in Bath Uni, 
and started to wander around the campus. We got lost in the maths department, attempted to break into the library, and laughed at the 
lack of arts students. Towards the end of the central walkway, we turned up into the forest behind the uni, and became thoroughly lost 
(laughing at things and getting very lost are now running jokes between us). We later found our way back down the hill, and arrived 
amongst the student accommodation, before walking back to the bus. The bus pulled up at the train station, and we ran inside, as it was 
starting to rain, and the train was about to leave. We decided to catch an earlier train to Temple Meads, to try and outpace our train to 
Cardiff. As soon as we stepped onboard, the heavens opened, and the city was pounded from above by the heaviest rain either of us 
had ever heard, before or since. <br><br>
Unfortunately, our slow, stopping train was ushered into a siding not far from Temple Meads, to allow the faster train to Cardiff to 
pass. Bugger. When we finally arrived in Bristol, our train to Cardiff was about to leave... so we sprinted down the stairs, through the 
tunnel, and made it just in time (luckily, the train was delayed, so we needn't have run). We took the train all the way to Cardiff. <br><br>
The train terminated there, so we got off and walked through the city centre. Neither of us had been to Cardiff often before, so we didn't 
really know where we were going, and this wasn't helped by the ubiquitous construction work. On our meandering journey through Cardiff, 
we amused ourselves by counting the number of Greggs that we saw. We found our way to a Starbucks, ordered tea, and sat upstairs, 
watching the weather get steadily worse. Time ticked down, and we realised we had left it too late to sensibly catch our train. 
Unfortunately, Matthew was there, so we instead decided to listen to Matthew, and sprint with boiling cups of tea, through the pouring 
rain, all the way to the station. We cut our way through streets, threw ourselves down staircases, and Matthew screamed "cease thine 
tirade, infernal telescreen!" at James's phone every time it gave us directions. We actually managed to reach the station on time, 
which was fortunate, seeing as all subsequent trains had been cancelled due to the weather. We triumphantly boarded our 3rd Class 800 
of the day, dripping wet, and set off home. <br><br>
On the way, James brought out his new purchase, and read out loudly from his book all the beautifully withering insults contained 
within. Which was worse - the insults themselves or the glares of parents and grandparents seated in the quiet carriage alongside us?
Nope, it was definitely the insults. We arrived home in the early evening, after our first adventure together as a pair, and 
having set the tone for adventures to come.

<button type="button" class="collapsible"> β2: Tenby </button>
<div class="content">
<p> Visiting Bath in Spring 2018 had been nice, but it was planned far too well. In early July 2018, we decided to plan a far more 
	impromptu trip to Tenby, our first westward journey. Matthew took the train from Neath, whilst James caught the train at Gowerton. 
	the train then hugged the Dyfed coastline as we travelled deep into Carmarthenshire. Screw GWR with their functioning trains. 
	It was time to head into Pacerland<sup>TM</sup>.<br><br>
	We had a taste of things to come when our train terminated at Carmarthen (which is quite a long detour from the main track). 
	Carmarthen has no footbridge, so we had to cross the tracks directly, over a plastic gangway. This was nutty. Then, our new train 
	arrived. Our first pacer. How unprepared we were for the glory of pacers. All the way down, it shook violently on its poorly-designed 
	chassis, and screamed violently every time the breaks were applied. We headed deeper into West Wales, and then turned down the 
	Pembroke Dock branch line, passing Whitland, Narberth (where James regaled Matthew with his mother's tale of woe at having to walk 
	3 miles from the station to the actual village), and passed our first request stops, which was a novel concept to us both. <br><br>
	Finally, we arrived in Tenby, and disembarked along with many holiday makers. We walked up the hill to the town, passing the Premier Inn, 
	and arrived at the seafront. We wandered down the seafront, and found a nice bench overlooking the sea. We had both missed the sea 
	air. We sat there, reminiscing about the past for a long time. During the course of the day, we walked the full length of the 
	promenade numerous times, walked down to the marina, went to the sheltered cove, down to the sea via some old steps, and somehow 
	managed to leave the town centre entirely, making it to a petrol station by the railway viaduct, at the bottom of the hill. This 
	was one of Matthew's first demonstrations of his amazing talent at ending up in a miserable place, no matter how lovely that place is 
	meant to be. We explored the town centre that day, wandered around the indoor market, had fish and chips, ice cream, and had tea 
	in a cosy tea shop, which was very nice. By late afternoon, we were ready to leave, so headed back to the station to thoroughly explore it.  <br><br>
	Our train turned up soon after, and to our surprise, it was a GWR HST. We had inadvertantly managed to catch one of GWR's 
	rare summer services all the way to Tenby. We hopped on, grateful for the comfort in comparison to the pacer that morning. 
	We alighted the train at Swansea and Neath, whilst it continued all the way to Paddington. β2 was a real turning point for NT. 
	For the first time, our adventure had given equal weightings to the journey and the destination, which by the ϡ adventures, 
	had been taken to its illogical extreme.
	</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible"> β3: Oystermouth Castle </button>
<div class="content">
<p> The reader may be left slightly confused here. Oystermouth Castle is nowhere near a train station. In fact, James didn't travel 
	on a single train all day! James has something to say in his defense about this adventure's inclusion -  Bu Hao Mao!<br><br>
	Later that summer, Matthew came down to Swansea to visit James. They met at the train station, and started walking. We walked 
	through the city centre, and out into Uplands, passing Ffynone (cue reminiscing). Upon this, we decided to start following the 
	route we'd taken during one of our escapades down to the seafront during study leave for GCSEs. We wandered down all the dodgy 
	alleyways, laughing insanely at what we'd been up to in school. When we got to the steep hill leading down to the seafront from 
	Brynmill, we changed course and headed towards the university, where we used to play sports on a Monday. When we got near, we 
	decided to get lost in Sketty instead, but not quite as lost as the yellow bus we saw, which was on its way to Southhampton. To 
	this day, we maintain that the bus was drunk and should go home! We then got lost in Sketty, until we reached the Clyne Valley Park. 
	We decided that this was a much better place to get lost in, and quickly achieved this. We walked to the top of the highest hill we 
	could find, narrowly avoiding being run over by a gang of BMX riders, before heading to the seafront at last. We stopped for tea 
	at Ripples, then walked all the way to Mumbles. When we arrived, we headed up to Oystermouth Castle, paid the entrance fee, and started 
	exploring. <br><br>
	So far, the reader can be forgiven for assuming that we must be idiots to include this amongst other NT adventures. But it was 
	here, more than anywhere else, that our level of nuttiness metamorphosed from normal nutty to having completely lost our minds.<br><br>
	A large group of Chinese tourists arrived as we were talking to the curator on the desk. He called to the tourists to come and 
	pay, and started gesturing the same thing. In response, they merely took pictures of him on their iPhones and kept walking and 
	snapping. Matthew didn't want to have to interact with people, so we continued on our tour, but eventually we reached the staircase 
	to the battlements, something we had been looking forward to very much. However, we reached it at exactly the same time as the 
	tourists. We managed to get up, but when it was time to come down, it was impossible, as the staircase was now blocked. They were 
	pushing and shoving, and there was no way to penetrate the crowd. What were we going to do? <br><br>
	At this point, something broke in both Matthew and James, and they used their knowledge of Chinese to politely ask the tourists to 
	move (James is fluent in Chinese, Spanish and Bad Latin<sup>TM</sup>). James shouted "BU HAO MAO!" to the tourists, as they turned 
	to look at us. "Bu hao mao?" he asked the closest one. "Bu hao mao? Bu Hao Mao? BU HAO MAO!". At this point, the crowd parted like the 
	Red Sea, and we quickly fled the castle, rolling about with laughter. Something also snapped in Matthew, who decided to down the 
	motte far too quickly, with madness in his eyes, as we talked about James proliferating his new Bad Latin<sup>TM</sup> language 
	amongst the plebs in Camborne. He was going to corrupt them, and see how much they could corrupt the language. After getting lost in 
	a small patch of forest, we re-emerged by the seafront, and started to walk back to the train station, after a thoroughly satisfying 
	adventure.<br><br>
	After this adventure, β3, there was no going back. The nuttiness line had been irrevocably broken. It was time for real NT to begin!
