<p> NT adventures are for special occasions, when we find time (and money) to meet up for some critical-density nuttiness. This 
unfortunately means that we are only to meet up on a select few occasions each year (and our list of adventures testifies). 
Fear not, however, as we still get up to plenty of nuttiness on our own! The Aleph adventures are a special section of the website, 
dedicated to such solo adventures. And if you hadn't guessed from the name of this page, there are a lot of these adventures! 
Therefore, this list is unlikely to ever be complete. However, these will hopefully include some of our more interesting adventures, 
as opposed to our run-of-the-mill ones: Matthew finding 3000 different detours around London because he was too impatient to wait 
3 minutes for the Circle line, and James watching his fellow residents of Camborne take various drugs. Enjoy this bonus nuttiness!

<button type="button" class="collapsible" id="1">&#x2135;<sub>0</sub>: Aleph Null: The Olympics (Summer 2012)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> We have written the story of James's first encounter with a train, but the story of Matthew's first encounter with a train remains 
unwritten... until now!
<br><br>
Okay, that is a lie. My childhood fascination with Thomas the Tank engine meant that I'd been on plenty of steam trains in my time, 
but it wasn't until I was 10 years old that I rode on a modern train, and what a way to start it was! (Also, this will be written 
in 1st person, not in my usual disembodied 3rd person, because that would be inappropriate here).
<br><br>
In 2012, the Olympics were in London, so my Dad bought 2 tickets for me and him to see one of the athletics heats in the Olympic 
Stadium. He had also tried to buy tickets for a cycling heat in the Velodrome, but these had sold out. He managed to get some 
morning tickets, meaning we'd have to set off very early in the morning to reach London on time. Therefore, we bought tickets for 
the 4:09am train from Neath to Paddington.
<br><br>
That morning, I was woken up at 2am and we got ready to leave the house at half past 3, before walking down to the station. 
Embarassingly, I took my dad's camera and took frequent film clips over the course of the day, which I refuse to watch on principle.
<br><br>
Neath at night was a very strange place. From what I had been told, I had expected it to be filled with raging drunks, littered 
with needles, and there to be an unsavoury character around every street corner. Yet there was none of that. Neath was dead. 
Completely and utterly dead. There wasn't a single person, a single car engine, or even a breath of wind. The only noise was of our 
echoing footsteps. That night, the stars were on full display, yet the town and the sky was drowned in the acidic orange light from 
the ubiquitous sodium streetlamps. Every wall glowed bright orange, every paving slab shone brightly and the sky burnished above us, 
less black than orange.
<br><br>
We entered the station using the night entrance, and soon enough our train, an Intercity 125 pulled up, and we settled in for the 
long 3 hour journey ahead of us. My dad fell asleep, but I was awake the whole way. Even though I couldn't see out of the window 
due to the extreme darkness, I took note of the stations as we passed them - Neath, Port Talbot Parkway, Bridgend, Cardiff Central, 
Newport, Bristol Parkway, Swindon, Didcot Parkway, Reading, and London Paddington.
<br><br>
Despite it being the height of summer, it was only light enough to see outside by about Didcot, where I saw numerous other Intercities 
parked up. On the line past Reading, I asked why the train wasn't stopping at all the little stations (I specifically asked about 
Iver, which along with the other little stations, forms part of TfL Rail at the time of writing). Before long, we pulled into the 
capital, and entered the magnificence of Paddington. Paddington's gracious arches would be enough to stun James years later, so you 
can only imagine the effect it had on me at age 10. 
<br><br>
That was my first ever train journey, but it was not my only first that day, for this was my first ever time visiting London (ironic 
then, that by the end of the same decade I am living in London). By extension of that fact, it was to be my first ever time on the tube. 
To make matters worse, it was about half past 7 and approching rush hour.
<br><br>
We bought tickets at the ticket machine (I still have mine at home), and went down the stairs, through the ticket barrier and turned left 
for the Bakerloo line. The Bakerloo line, as mentioned elsewhere, has an old-timey, almost Sherlock Holmes feel to it. It has a brown 
moquette, very 70s ends to the seats, and a series of other antiquated features that just make it seem incredibly charming and twee. 
What isn't twee about the Bakerloo line is the incessant shaking and rumbling as it travels down the line, often in quite a circuitous 
manner.
<br><br>
I didn't really appreciate the charm of the Bakerloo line, having been crammed into a busy commuter-rush train for the first time, 
on a loud train in a dark tunnel, surrounded by people much much bigger than me. After all, I was well under 5ft tall at the time, 
and simply unable to reach the handrails at the top of the carriage. Instead, I stuck to my dad tightly, hoping the crush didn't 
worsen.
<br><br>
I was wrong.
<br><br>
We changed at Oxford Circus to the Central Line, and this train was significantly hotter, denser and longer than the previous. 
Even to this day, I have only ever seen 1 tube train more packed than this one (it was so packed I couldn't physically fit on), 
but my opinion of this train was certainly worsened by my relative height to everyone else. In fact, I was deeply troubled by the 
crush of people by the time we exited the train (along with most others) at Stratford, and began the long walk from the 
inconveniently-located station to the Olympic Park.
<br><br>
Along the way, I had fleeting moments of terror when my dad first let go of my hand, then appeared to forget I was there and speed 
up, all whilst we were in the biggest crowd of people I have ever seen, before or since.
We passed various bilingual (English-French) banners, before the Orbit Tower and the various venues came into view. I pointed out the 
various stadia, having studied them extensively, before we reached the Olympic Stadium itself, climbed the stairs, and took our 
seats. The stadium was absolutely enormous! It seemed larger than a meteor crater, filled to the brim with cheering fans. There were 
giant screens around the stadium, beaming live feeds of the fans, and counting down until the morning's events began.
<br><br>
I don't remember a huge amount about the events themselves, other than that they all happened more-or-less simultaneously, rather 
than sequentially. I do remember the sounds of cheers echoing around the stadium, following the runners as they circled the track 
in one of the longer running events. I also remember the TV camera pointed at the fans just a few rows below me, meaning that I 
very nearly appeared on TV (but fortunately didn't). 
<br><br>
Luckily, I kept extensive records of the games themselves, allowing me to fill in some of the blanks. On that day, the 7th of August, 
I went to see the 10am Athletics event, in the main Olympic Stadium. The events that day were:<br>
Women's Javelin Qualifying,<br>
Men's 110m Hurdles Heats,<br>
Men's Triple Jump Qualifying,<br>
Women's 5000m Heats,<br>
and Men's 200m Heats.
<br><br>
I vaguely remember the triple jump and javelin events, although they took place on the opposite side of the stadium to me, so I didn't get a 
particularly good look at them. I also vaguely recall the 110m hurdles. The women's 5000m heats lasted a very good while, as they circled 
round and around the track, followed by a perennial wall of cacophanous cheering, rotating around the stadium as the women passed each stand. 
The highlight of the event was the 200m heats, in which Usain Bolt appeared. They were off like rockets, doing a half lap of the stadium, to absolutely 
rapturous cheers and applause. It was a fantastic spectacle to behold!
<br><br>
The event finished at lunchtime, and we left the stadium, heading out towards the food court near the Orbit tower. However, as it was exceptionally busy, we 
decided against getting food and trying to go up the tower. We instead decided to head into London. Stratford station was packed, so instead, 
we were directed by crowd martials along the long landscaped path to West Ham tube station, a distance of a few miles, which was a very pleasant walk. 
We got on the District line (and actually had seats), and rode the tube all the way to Westminster. In hindsight, this means that 
I actually had a chance to ride on the old D stock, which I wouldn't have had a clue about at the time. We then alighted and saw 
Big Ben from almost directly below the clock tower, something which I have since repeated with both Freya and James. 
<br><br>
We walked past Westminster Abbey and up Parliament Street to Trafalgar Square, if memory serves me correctly. After seeing Trafalgar 
Square, we walked through Admiralty Arch and up The Mall to Buckingham Palace. We then went and sat in Green Park, where we bought a Team GB-emblazoned 
Union Flag (which is still in my room today), then got on the tube and took the Jubilee and Bakerloo lines back to Paddington (thank you 10 year old Matthew for 
annotating the tube map!).
<br><br>
At about 4pm, we arrived back in Paddington, quite possibly via Lancaster Gate. I had lunch from one of the sandwich shops there, 
and we caught the train home. The train journey back was equally uneventful, except the couple opposite us occasionally argued about 
where they should alight. We arrived home late in the evening and were picked up in the car and taken home, after a very long and 
exciting day.

<button type="button" class="collapsible" id="2">&#x2135;<sub>1</sub>: Matthew's study leave mistake (Summer 2017)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> During study leave one day, Matthew decided to go home on the train, which was a first. Unfortunately, he made some critical 
mistakes.
	<br><br>
This is quite a short adventure, but still an amusing story. It was study leave in Year 11, in early June. By this point, some 
people had finished all their exams, and everyone left had only 1 or 2 to go (Matthew had 4 or 5, if memory serves me correctly), 
so naturally, everyone was spending most of their time pissing around and being clique. This didn't please Matthew, so at 1 o'clock, 
he decided to go home on the train, which he had never actually done before.
	<br><br>
Matthew signed out on the register, and walked down the crescent, turned onto Walter Road, and walked towards the train station. 
It was a reasonably short walk, which took 20-ish minutes (Matthew's walking pace was slower back then), before he arrived at the 
station and went to the ticket office.
	<br><br>
Matthew: Can I have a child single to Neath please?
Ticket Lady: Are you sure you won't be coming back? A return is much cheaper than 2 singles<br>
Matthew: <em> I'm sure </em>
	<br><br>
Matthew caught the train and triumphantly arrived in Neath, happy that he had managed to get home and avoid another 3 hours of pissing 
about and cliqueiness. We walked home, only to find that there was no car in the drive, and no-one was home. This was a problem. 
He decided instead to walk up the hill to his grandparents' house, only to find they were also absent. This was a big problem.
Here, I ought to explain why I have included this as an NT adventure:
	<br><br>
Matthew had brought money that day, anticipating that he might want to catch the train.<br>
However, Matthew had not brought his keys, as he assumed that someone would be home to let him in (in his defense, it was half past 2, 
and Ffynone didn't finish until 4, so this was a reasonable assumption).<br>
Furthermore, he had no mobile phone, so was unable to contact anyone to say where he was.<br>
So now you see why this was a problem.
	<br><br>
With no way to get into the house, neither any means of contacting anyone to say where he was, the outcome of the scenario would 
have been distinctly unpleasant. So Matthew was forced to go back to the train station, and buy another ticket!
	<br><br>
Matthew: Can I have a child single to Swansea?<br>
Ticket Lady: Would you like a return?<br>
Matthew: No, this time I am sure I only want a single.
	<br><br>
The train arrived in Swansea at about 25 to 4, giving only 15 minutes before his mum would pull up on the hashed yellow lines, 
expecting him to be out immediately (which, by the way, never happened). So he ran. He ran for as long as he could (not very long 
at the time), and powerwalked the rest, back though the city, back up the hill, back along Walter Road (running into his music 
teacher along the way), and up to the school, seeing his mum parked, as predicted, on the hashed yellow lines, waiting impatiently. 
He dived into the car (before 5 to 4), received his daily bollocking for being late, and headed home. Again.
	<br><br>
The moral of this traumatic experience for Matthew was to always carry his keys and his phone. As with everything, he learnt the 
hard way.
</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible" id="3">&#x2135;<sub>2</sub>: Operation Swanedi (September 2017)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> This is easily worthy of a position in NT. For some reason, Matthew decided to get on a train at 2am in the morning, wander 
hopelessly around Swansea until 4, and then go back home. Why? Just Why? (Much to James' worry)
<br><br>
In late August, it dawned upon Matthew that with the exception of meeting James once earlier in the summer, and seeing everyone 
on Results Day, Matthew hadn't actually done anything all summer. Yet he would be going to sixth form in just a week's time, and 
didn't want to have yet another wasted summer. He decided to do something grand, daring, audacious... and completely stupid. 
<br><br>
Armed with a train timetable, Matthew began searching through all the trains passing through Neath, and became interested in an 
apparent anomaly in the schedule: Paddington trains started at 4am and ended at about midnight, providing regular service, once per 
hour (although they started and ended at different times for different directions). Likewise, the local ATW trains started at 6-ish 
and ended at about half past midnight, providing varying degrees of frequency. This left a gap of 3.5 hours in the night with no 
trains... except one. There was one solitary Swansea-bound service at about 10 past 2 in the morning, and nothing for hours before 
or after (Westbound services started at 6-ish and ended at half-11-ish). This was terribly strange, and picqued Matthew's interest. 
He christened it the milk train (although in hindsight, the milk train would have run at about 5am, as opposed to 2am, but my point 
stands).
<br><br>
And then it dawned on him. To do something exciting in the last weekend of what had meant to have been an amazing summer, he would 
investigate the milk train, before catching the 4am Paddington service home. This was going to be a grand adventure, and he planned 
it extensively beforehand, buying tickets and formulating a plan.
<br><br>
On the the evening of Friday, 1st of September, Matthew went into Neath for a few hours to meet up with a friend from school, and 
then headed home. This in itself was one of the most exciting things to happen all summer, but the excitement was only just about 
to begin. By about midnight, his parents were in bed, and at half past one in the morning, he crept down the stairs, slipped his 
coat and shoes on, and left the house, having practiced this routine countless times before when going on early-morning walks. There 
was only one minor issue with the plan - he forgot to turn the CCTV cameras off. Oops. Fortunately, despite there still being CCTV 
footage on his parents computer of him leaving (and returning), he was never discovered.
<br><br>
Walking down the street, under the acrid glow of the sodium lamps once more felt good. It reminded Matthew strongly of the time he 
went to the Olympics. What was less reassuring was the high volume of police cars patrolling the street, accompanied by the gangs of 
completely pissed women and roving squads of youths. Matthew arrived at the station, using the night entrance, only to find a rowdy 
group of men on the platform and that the train was delayed until half past 2. Yikes.
<br><br>
Matthew killed time by wandering around the station car park, then slipped onto the platform discreetly as the train arrived, and 
headed on his way to Swansea, arriving and exiting swiftly. He then walked quickly down High St, through Castle Square and the city 
centre, swiftly finding his way down to Tesco. After crossing the road in a dodgy place and almost getting killed on a corner, he 
crossed Oystermouth road, passed the library, and reached the seafront.
<br><br>
It was hard to tell which was a deeper black, the sea or the sky. The stars twinkled in the sky, pale pinpricks of shimmering light 
in an ocean of darkness, whilst the warm glow of light from sodium lamps on the opposite side of the bay splashed rippling paintstrokes 
of light across the canvas of the black sea, the shadows of light gently rising and falling in the swell. I must have stood there, 
bathed in orange half-light, standing upon the blanket of sand coating the path, staring at the inky blackness, for about 10 minutes, 
before I slowly moved on.
<br><br>
I walked along the seafront path all the way to the Brangwyn Hall before turning around and retracing my steps. The entire journey 
was a huge nostalgia trip. It brought memories of my last 8 years going to school in Swansea flooding back to me, especially the 
memories of study leave, when we'd gone out and explored Swansea properly for the first time in my life. Even though study leave was 
punctured by a myriad of exams, going out, just for a simple walk, made me very happy indeed, which is how I felt retracing 
my steps that night too. By 3am, Swansea was surprisingly calm, serene and peaceful, and I hardly met anyone in my hour and a half 
walk. I spent a lot of time reflecting on that walk about the future. I would be going to sixth form in just a week, and in 2 years 
time, off to university. My world was changing rapidly after years of being stuck in steady-state. Things weren't going to be the same 
ever again. 
<br><br>
I arrived back at the station just before 4, having walked this time up the deserted Kingsway. Like clockwork, I caught the Paddington 
train, alighted at Neath, walked back through the now-deserted town centre, and slipped back into my house, and quickly went to bed. 
Even though the summer had been a wash-out, I had managed to do one noteworthy thing at the very least.
<br><br>
That is the end of this adventure, but I shall also append my first brief encounter with a Class 800, on only its first day of 
operation, just a few weeks later! For some reason, I had decided to go to Swansea after college one afternoon. I don't remember 
why, but it may have been to see one of my school friends. I arrived at Neath station, and awaited my GWR train.
<br><br>
Yet the train that arrived was different to the ones I'd seen before. I had been expecting an old blue Intercity 125, but instead 
a new shiny green train arrived, resplendent in its dark-green GWR livery. I had inadvertently managed to catch a new Class 800 train 
on its very first day of service! (James, it was 800020, if you are wondering). I was amazed by the new interior, which looked so 
modern and sleek compared to the other trains on the line. I was awed by the LED seat displays replacing the slips of paper in the 
top of each seat. Moreover, it was fast. We arrived in Swansea ahead of schedule, and I immediately set about messaging people 
about the brand-new train I'd seen!
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible" id="4">&#x2135;<sub>3</sub>: STEP time! (September 2017 - May 2018)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> So you know that it takes two hours to get to Exeter on the train? Well James did this every saturday for
four months to get a couple of STEP qualifications, just for fun. He is still yet to do STEP III.
<br>
STEP was a wonderful time, the usual trip was from Newquay, along the branchline to Par, still James' favourite piece of 
track on the network, even more than HoW. So he would then wait for 30 minutes or more to get up the line to Exeter! It was usually 
uneventful, I usually worked on Further Maths or if I was running behind on the problem sheet from last week, then it was to be worked
on the way up.<br>
I would then walk to Exeter Mathematics School, to do the session, I distinct remember my first session I was early and they weren't 
expecting anybody but I turned up and ruined that! So myself and the tutor got on with some problems and this was to start the beginning
of my relationship with hard maths problems, which would drain the last remaining sanity out of my body and keep me going through the year 
to follow with all it's problems, because remember a maths problem can break you mentally but it only a good problem can heal your emotional
state.<br>
On one particular Saturday I had missed the branchline and I remember specifically going to St Austell instead with my father, who really doesn't
do public transport, let alone trains. He was amused by the length of the HST.<br>
The sessions would last 4 hours, so it was worth going to, usually they'd involve Nick telling us some weird and whacky Maths thing and then doing
a problem sheet on them. I miss a lot about those sessions and still value and use the Maths I learnt, we did a lot of integration stuff and I loved it.<br>
Then after these session's I'd head to McDo Exeter and then onwards to EXD and back home, if I was lucky enough to get the train.
</p>
<p> One of the 'STEP' times that I remember was when I went for an extra session with my tutor, this was a Friday and I remember being slightly lenient with the 
time that day, wanting to get the most out of my money. It should also be noted that on this day, James has an advance first class tiket, noted as the start of the curse of the
first class ticket. So I knew that I was short on time, so I got a lift back to the train station. I arrive at the station and I run to the platform and then I see the train 
run off down to the platform back down south.<br>
So James headed back into Exon, ready to find some food, as at this time, he was hungry. Luckily James' father was passing by so he could get a lift, but he headed to Pizza Express
to wait out the time it takes his father to get there. Luckily this Pizza Express is extremely scenic, it overlooks the Cathedral. The Pizza was good and James got home... eventually.
</p>
<hr>
<p><small>As a footer to this, it is worth noting that every Saturday in September and October 2018, Matthew took the train to Swansea for 
MAT sessions. Due to this being a short journey on a non-pacer line, very few interesting things happened, although as Ewan will 
testify, we missed more than one train due to Matthew thinking it was a good idea to get out of bed at 08:20 to catch an 08:32 
train. The only exception to this was Matthew once catching a 6:00-ish train to Swansea, because why not? After MAT, Matthew, 
Ewan and Freya would walk back to Swansea, Ewan would go home, and Matthew and Freya would have study dates in various cafes.</small></p>

</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible" id="5">&#x2135;<sub>4</sub>: Operation Trostrail (December 2017)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> Matthew decided it was a great idea to catch a train to Llanelli, and just walk to Parc Trostre from there, 
through various rotten bits of Llanelli. Definitely a great idea.
<br><br>
Matthew had been trying to meet with a friend from school for quite some time (I believe that the first class 800 encounter was 
one such failed attempt), so decided in that December to bite the bullet and go straight to where he worked in Parc Trostre. 
He had only ever been to Swansea on his own on the train before, so going further was a novel experience. Those were the days...
<br><br>
It was a fairly miserable day, with a light sheet of mizzle clinging to everywhere. Matthew headed down to Neath, bought a ticket, 
and caught an ATW train to Llanelli. After about half an hour, he arrived at the station (which has a level crossing, as would be 
pointed out to James in ϡ6), and exited onto a backstreet, somewhere in southern Llanelli.
<br><br>
It is at this point I should add that not only had Matthew never been to Llanelli via train before, he had never actually been to 
Llanelli full stop (it is not hard to see why this was practice for later NT adventures). He opened Google maps, and began to navigate 
around the outskirts of an industrial estate, along a series of rundown railway terrace houses, and through various other dodgy 
places that a sane person might not go.
<br><br>
He reached a large park, and walking through that was the longest, albeit most pleasant section of the journey. At the other end, 
he ran across a busy road, and walked through a series of car parks and junctions at Parc Trostre to reach his final destination... 
only to find that his friend had just left. Damn. Not only that, but he could not buy lunch, as he had no money. With nothing else 
to do, he walked all the way back to the train station, and headed home.
<br><br>
Whilst this is quite a sad adventure, it didn't take long for the spark of adventure that &#x2135;<sub>3</sub> and &#x2135;<sub>4</sub> 
had ignited within him to flare up massively. Matthew was eager for more adventure, to steadily further places. When he met up 
with James over Whitson, the direct result was NT βI. Nutty adventures on the train had been born!
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#x2135;<sub>5</sub>: Tube and Tab (March 2018)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> So James had a interview in London for IBM, this meant that he had to go to London, join him on his way through 
the tube, the second time ever and first on my own. Then to the splendeur of Tab. Getting lost shanked and then to top me off, getting to go home
via Waterloo.
<hr>
So this was a fun one. This is the one where we talk about the Night Riviera and more of a NT adventure than all the rest. He didn't sleep all night, but that is only 
the beginning of th grizzly and fun details!
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#x2135;<sub>6</sub>: Bristol Open Day (September 2018)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> Matthew and Freya caught a very early train to Bristol (via Bristol Parkway), to go to the Bristol Uni open day. This turned 
out to be a very important day for us, despite the mad dash for the train home.
<br><br>
I woke up at 5:30am, and very early on, walked down to Neath train station. I caught the 6:41am train to Port Talbot Parkway, whereupon 
I disembarked to wait for Freya. She arrived at about 10 to 8 (when we had agreed to meet), found seats together and took the train 
all the way to Bristol Parkway.
<br><br>
When buying the tickets, Freya had mistakenly bought advance tickets to and returning from Bristol Parkway. Unfortunately, Bristol 
Parkway is a desolate wasteground nowhere near Bristol. We had rectified this by buying an extra ticket from Parkway to Temple Meads 
for her, but this meant we had to perform a slightly awkward manoeuver - travel to Bristol Parkway, and then change to the commuter 
line running through the city (which, at the time, was undergoing extensive reconstruction).
<br><br>
This was completely successful in the morning, but the CrossCountry train we caught was very busy (and smelt slightly funny), but 
we were only on there for a few minutes, before we exited Bristol Temple Meads. We got slightly lost in walking through one of the new 
redevelopments on the riverside, but we soon reached the north bank of the river, and quickly progressed through the city centre. 
<br><br>
We took a strange route, up the famous Christmas steps, and ascended successively steeper hills to the Cathedral at the bottom of the 
campus. At this point, I left Freya to attend her first event, and sprinted up the hill to my first talk, in 5 minutes. I greatly 
enjoyed the maths talk, in constrast to the maths talk I'd been to at my previous Bristol open day. Freya then attended my physics 
talk afterwards.
<br><br>
We then both headed to one of the university's annex buildings for a classics talk, before heading to an older, central building, 
surrounded by greenery, for her history talk, which she unfortunately did not enjoy. Finally, we went to her modern languages talk 
(after almost getting lost in a maze of corridors), and saw all the modern languages they had to offer there.
<br><br>
Between the history and modern languages talks, we also went to visit the university's newest flagship student accomodation block, 
which impressed both of us (although I had visited previously).
<br><br>
We walked back into the old town and started exploring for a bit. We visited Stamfords, a huge map and mapbook store, and spent 
excessively long there, immersed in the all the books. In fact, it was a ratherly over-excessive amount of time to spend there, as 
we then had limited time in which to reach the station. Despite walking at a quick pace all the way to Temple Meads, we had to sprint 
the last section. 
<br><br>
We sprinted up the long driveway to the station, legged it through the ticket office, passed through the barriers, and headed for the 
stairs. I practically threw myself down the stairs, inadventently leaving Freya behind, ran down the concourse, and leapt up the stairs 
to our platform, where our train to Bristol Parkway was waiting, ready to depart.
<br><br>
Except Freya wasn't there.
<br><br>
So I ran to the train, put one foot through the door, and left the other on the platform, and I stood there, half-in, half-out, 
for a full minute, whilst the guard shot murderous looks at me. The train was now delayed, thanks to me.
<br><br>
Freya ran up the stairs, jumped aboard, and we both headed to find seats. She was absolutely exhausted after so much running, and 
still hadn't recovered 15 minutes later when we arrived at Parkway. Indeed, I spent those 15 minutes apologising for making her 
run so fast and for so long, but at least we had made our train!
<br><br>
Except it had all been in vain. Our train was delayed by 20 minutes, meaning we could have comfortably caught the next train from 
Temple Meads, without running at all. Such is my life. We finally caught our train home, whereupon Freya headed to her friend's 
18<sup>th</sup> birthday party.
<br><br>
Except... it hadn't all been in vain. She was really touched. She'd really enjoyed watching me all day.
<br><br>
2 months later, we became boyfriend and girlfriend &#10084;

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#x2135;<sub>7</sub>: Valley Lines 0 (September 2018)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> Matthew and his friend Ewan went to the fabled station of <strong>Nantgarw</strong> for a MAT session, but on the way, Matthew made the fatal 
error of jumping on the first valley train he saw... without checking the destination. Hmm. This sounds familiar...
<br><br>
In early July 2018, Matthew had been invited to what was allegedly a joint MAT/PAT session, organised by SEREN in Coleg Y Cymoedd, 
in <s>Treforest</s> Nantgarw, which had involved him getting on the most packed commuter train he'd ever been on outside London, 
changing to the Valley lines for the very first time and heading north, before alighting at Nantgarw and walking a mile down the 
road to the college. 
<br><br>
Nantgarw is an exceptionally weird station. It consists of a single island platform between the 2 tracks, with a central 
staircase leading down through the platform and along a subway to the ground level below. Passengers must then walk along a dirt 
track through an old industrial area for a while, before finally reaching the dual carriageway through the business estate that 
the college is located at the south end of. After the session, Matthew decided to walk slightly further to the other station, Taff's Well, 
due to its higher frequency service on the way back.
<br><br>
Ewan had also been invited to the session (which turned out to be a guinea pig session for future MAT sessions), 
but decided not to come... and neither did most of Wales. The entire session had less than 10 people there, yet still went very 
slowly. Despite this, the decision was made to run another in September 2018, which is where this adventure begins.
<br><br>
Early that morning, at about 7am, Matthew and Ewan headed to Neath railway station to catch the train to Cardiff (Matthew was on 
time for once). Even back in September 2018, before the official start of NT, Ewan was fully aware that Matthew doesn't make the 
best travelling companion, especially on trains, due to his inability to be anywhere on time, and his colourful history of random 
adventures on the trains. Matthew, for his part, insisted that he had planned everything to a tee, and that nothing could possibly 
go wrong.
<br><br> 
As the train approached Cardiff, everything was running smoothly for once. How strange! Everything was running so smoothly 
in fact, that there was the possibility of catching an earlier train to Nantgarw (which ran once an hour), as opposed to the one 
that Matthew had planned to catch. According to the timetables, there would be a 3-minute connection, but that seemed like nothing 
after the previous adventure - it would be fine!
<br><br>
And then things stopped going smoothly. The platform at the station was occupied, so the train ground to a halt just before the station. 
We were now losing crucial time, and this was an issue. Our 3 minute connection was rapidly becoming a 2 minute connection, and by the 
time the doors opened, we had just one minute. Once again, Matthew employed the "fucking leg it!" solution, and Ewan struggled to 
keep up as Matthew threw himself down the flight of stairs, sprinted along the corridor, and flew up the stairs to the departure 
platform.
<br><br>
When he arrived, there was a pacer stopped directly in front of the stairs on the correct platform. Correct platform? Correct time? 
Correct crappiness of the train? This must be our valley line train! Matthew ran on, with Ewan just behind, and we sat down, 
having triumphantly made our connection. The train pulled out of the station, and headed up the track through Queen Street. Matthew 
was now fully confident that he would be making a triumphant and leisurely return to Nantgarw.
<br><br>
However, along the way, a few things seemed off. Firstly, Matthew never noticed the train passing through Cathays or Radyr stations, 
which he knew the line stopped at. Hmm. Weird. 'Perhaps I just didn't notice them' he thought.
<br><br>
Secondly, the train started to stop at some stations Matthew hadn't seen before, like Birchgrove. This wasn't even out of the corner 
of his eye either; Ewan explicitly mentioned it and had a 10 minute conversation about Birchgrove station! 'Perhaps I didn't notice 
Birchgrove last time', Matthew thought.
<br><br>
Thirdly, after about half an hour, we were still pulling through suburban Cardiff. This surely couldn't be right. Matthew quickly 
thought of an excuse, 'Perhaps... I just didn't notice the time in the summer?'.
<br><br>
Ewan started to check where the train was on Snap Maps. The map clearly showed that the train was deep in eastern Cardiff, far away 
from the line to Nantgarw. "The map lies!" said Matthew. "Snap maps is always wrong anyway".
<br><br>
That was all settled then.<br>
Everything was fine.</p>
<center><p><strong>And then the train started reversing</strong></p></center>
<p>Matthew had managed to catch the wrong train, and we were now half an hour away from the city centre, on some godforsaken pacer 
in suburban Cardiff. It was time to dial Matthew's stress-o-metre up to 11, where it usually sits.
<br><br>
Consulting his trustworthy timetable, whilst Ewan checked on his phone, we came to the conclusion that not only had we missed the 
early train to Nantgarw (obviously), but we had also missed our planned train to Nantgarw, which was the last to actually stop at 
Nantgarw in time.
<br><br>
Once Ewan had calmed Matthew out of panic mode, we decided that the best course of action was to get off the city line pacer at 
Queen Street, change to the Aberdare train, and get off at Taff's Well, 2 miles away from Nantgarw, with half an hour to spare. 
And duly, we did that. Matthew did, admittedly, run up a flight of stairs in panic, but otherwise things were okay. The Aberdare 
train announcement at Queen Street explicitly stated that there was no alcohol permitted on this early morning train. Welcome to 
the Valleys!
<br><br>
This time, Matthew recognised the stations on the route, Cardiff came to an end after 10 minutes, and Snap Maps revealed that we 
were going the right direction this time. We arrived in Taff's Well, and alighted.
<br><br>
For the next 2 miles, we powerwalked/jogged/sprinted, depending on how stressed Matthew was, and how knackered Ewan was at the 
time. Fortunately, we arrived with time to spare. When we reached the car park and came to cross each road, we managed the amazing 
magic trick of thanking the cars in unison. Absolutely magic.
<br><br>
We arrived in Coleg Y Cymoedd and Matthew immediately recognised the man taking the session. We went up, and said we were from 
Neath College and were here for the MAT session.
<br><br>
<i>"Neath College? What are you doing here? You must have had a long journey! Didn't anyone tell you that I am doing the exact same 
session tomorrow in Swansea? You didn't need to come all the way out here!"</i>
<br><br>
...
<br><br>
Yes. Someone told us that there would be a session on our doorstep, but we decided to come here instead.<br>
Of course no-one told us!
<br><br>
Rant over. The MAT session was good, I guess.
<br><br>
The real highlight of the day was actually exploring Coleg Y Cymoedd. It was absolutely huge! It could have swallowed up B Block 4 
times, and it was only 1 of 4 campuses of equal size for the college! Not only that, but the entire interior of the block was filled 
with an absolutely enormous atrium, 3 or 4 floors high, with a succession of flying staircases and walkways stretching up all the way. 
There were numerous classrooms with glass walls, and they had real carpet and fresh paint too! We didn't know what to make of it!
<br><br>
Ewan spent much of the day reporting back home about how lucky the other half had it. Sure, they had a McDonalds, KFC and Nandos 
around the corner, but that didn't come close to comparing to one of the 7 Wonders of Nantgarw: <strong>a functioning water fountain!
</strong>We couldn't believe our eyes! What was this magical thing, water pressure? Is this what water fountains were meant to do? 
This was a shocking discovery, but things only became more shocking.
<br><br>
We headed downstairs, to find that instead of a Brook-like canteen serving green eggs and ham, they had a full restaurant! A full, 
waited restaurant, complete with fancy crockery, cutlery and tablecloths, serving actual food, without the poisoning! Even more, 
you had to book a reservation, which was apparently very popular. What was this world we had stepped into?
<br><br>
We decided to head up to the kitchen to investigate. We stood by the kitchen door, and peered in, faces pressed against the glass. 
Then, one of the kitchen staff came up behind us and asked us what we were doing. Before we could reply sheepishly, she asked 
"would you like to come in and have a look?". And so, in this way, we had a tour of Coleg Y Cymoedd's kitchens, which was more than 
their actual students had had. By the time we left that afternoon, Nantgarw was legendary, and we were legends too.
<br><br>
We leisurely returned to Taff's Well on the way back, and the journey home was rather uneventful. Fear not though, for there is one 
final section to this adventure. When we recounted our tale in college the next day, it transpired that our chemistry teacher had 
also recently been to Nantgarw, and some of our medicine friends would also be heading there shortly after us for a BMAT course. 
Nantgarw, quite rightfully, was the centre of the universe, but only we had been given a tour of the kitchens there! 
<br><br>
(As a side note, Ewan would bully Matthew about him getting on the wrong train for months afterwards in physics lessons)
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#x2135;<sub>8</sub>: Bath III (November 2018)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> Matthew and Ewan then went on a trip to the University of Bath open day. Our journey involved a rail replacement bus journey, 
a surprise visit to Patchway, and Matthew spilling his lunch/burning hot tea down himself. Just a normal day then, really!
<br><br>
One Wednesday in October, Matthew and Ewan didn't turn up to college in the morning (thereby missing maths), but instead went to 
Neath train station to catch a train to Bath, for the Bath University open day. Missing maths wasn't a problem for Ewan, who was 
ahead of the course and on good attendance, but perhaps wasn't so good for Matthew, who despite also being ahead, hadn't turned up 
to a maths lesson in about 3 weeks, and was on about 40% attendance. Yikes.
<br><br>
We caught a GWR train to Bristol Parkway, which stopped briefly enough in Cardiff to avoid triggering Matthew's PTSD from the last 
adventure. At Bristol Parkway we alighted. ... Unfortunately, we now encountered a problem. The lines around Bristol were closed. 
At the time, there were extensive modernisation works taking place on all the Bristol lines, and we'd managed to arrive slap bang 
in the middle of them. This meant only one thing. Oh, the horror! A r...r...rail replacement bus!
<br><br>
We walked out of Bristol Parkway station (which is horrifcally ugly and in the middle of nowhere), to find our bus awaiting us.
It was a First bus, so that was familiar, despite not being reassuring. Admittedly, the double decker bus was from a completely 
different part of the country, but sometimes busses get lost, right?
<br><br>
The bus took well over half an hour to trundle down the M32 towards the city centre, and it finally dumped us in Temple Meads, 
ready for us to catch our Bath-bound train. I don't remember running on this occasion, but I have sprinted to catch countless trains 
at TM, so I may be mistaken. Either way, we were only on the train for a single stop before we alighted and entered Bath.
<br><br>
We walked into the city centre, and stood in front of the cathedral. Unless I am mistaken, we wandered for a bit along the streets 
of shops, saw an old market, and Palace Gardens. Matthew also bought a postcard for Freya in the souvenir shop outside the Roman 
Baths/the Cathedral. We then caught the unibus up to the university. It was on this bus journey that 
Matthew told Ewan he was no longer single, to Ewan's great dismay.
<br><br>
I then think we headed straight to the Dyson building, and went downstairs to the exhibition of past students' projects. We even saw your 
brother's poster (I hope you mentioned that to him). We talked to some current students, one running a Pascal's triangle-type game, 
one with a pile of Jenga blocks you could stack to create an overhang, and they also mentioned the (non-)convergence of a harmonic 
series. Whilst we were doing that, <strong>Prince Edward</strong> turned up for some reason?! We tried to stay in the corner so as 
not to invite attention to ourselves. Later on, Geoff Smith arrived, and we had a long chat to him about UKMT and the BMO, as we'd 
both recently had Golds in the Senior UKMT Challenge.
<br><br>
We were then invited into the room to have lunch. This is where things went wrong for Matthew.
<br><br>
Ewan, like a normal human being, managed to correctly load his plate and get a drink, before sitting down. Good job. Matthew, on the 
other hand, can barely pretend to be a normal human being, so this was not possible. His plate was imbalanced so slipped and bent in 
half. He then quickly moved his other hand to try and stop the slide. This would have worked, had his other hand not been holding a 
cup of boiling tea. He managed to splash some boiling tea on himself, which hurt, so he flinched violently, thereby not only spilling 
large quantities of tea over his body (which really hurt), but managing to drop his entire lunch on the floor. <strong>Everything. 
</strong> A kind student took pity on him, helped him clean it up, and when he was too embarassed to try again, actually got Matthew 
lunch. That was really kind, but only made him even more embarassed.
<br><br>
After a brief talk in the room, which may or may not have been brief, and may or may not have included bits of maths, 
we were taken to a large lecture hall, to hear a talk from Geoff (James, pay attention to this bit - 
<strong>Geoff Smith!!</strong>). He talked about the uni and the department and the course. It was quite a funny talk. ... (That's pretty much it. 
You can stop paying attention now). Oh, actually, I lie. He mentioned his work with UKMT, the BMO and the IMO, including IMO2019 (If 
you stopped paying attention, you missed out there). 
<br><br>
We then went on a tour of the university. It is at this point that I must apologise. I remember very little about the following 
order of events, and some of the events I remember are warped, distorted or just plain false. Think of this as a case study for your 
Netflix memory documentary rather than a "factual" NT account!
<br><br>
We saw the pond (and amphitheatre), the library, the union, the quads (cue spitting from Ewan) and some sort of theatre-y building. 
We also saw the extensive sporting facilities, an exam hall and the Chancellor's Building, but not necessarily in that order.
<br><br>
Following that, your guess is as good as mine. I have absolutely no idea what we did next, if anything at all. It is possible that 
the tour ended at that was that. It is possible that we did some maths. We may have done maths before then, which I have forgotten. 
I genuinely have no idea.
<br><br>
What I do know is that Matthew wrote Freya the postcard he'd bought earlier and posted it in the university post office. It was now 
growing dark, so we caught the unibus to the city, then got on a train to Bristol. This was a commuter train, so it stopped at all 
the little stops between the 2 cities. It was also around rushhour, so it was quite busy. 
<br><br>
We pulled into Bristol TM and exited, 
heading outside to the bus. It took us ages to get on the bus, and took ages for the bus to leave, but it took almost an hour for 
the bus to fight its way up the M32. Strangely, we were dumped not in Bristol Parkway, but in Patchway, a far lesser used station 
to the west. How bizzare. At some point on our journey home, we messaged and called our maths teacher Gareth, who had just recieved 
our UKMT scores. For once, the text messages were actually friendly and not at all threatening! That was even more bizarre. 
Finally, we caught the train home to Neath. We had a missed maths lesson to not catch up on.
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#x2135;<sub>9</sub>: Greenwich + DLR (October 2019)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> In freshers week, Matthew took the tube to a Japanese teahouse near The Angel, before taking the DLR from Bank to Greenwich 
to see an exibition about the moon. The DLR was like a rollercoaster!
<br><br>
In comparison to other adventures, this is a bit of a washout. After his first ever uni maths lecture (with KBuzz), Matthew took 
his work on the tube with him, and took the district line to Westminster. Here, he changed to the Jubilee line, to give him an 
excuse to see the vast expanses of concrete and steel that make up the colossal atrium of the station (see &#x2135;<sub>11</sub> 
and ϙ1 for further details). He took the Jubilee through the science fiction-themed stations to London Bridge (London Bridge station 
would fit in with the Death Star, and has custom steel panels which say "London Bridge"), and changed to the Northern Line. Yuck. 
(Matthew's hatred of the Northern line is summed up the best on ϙ1 once again).
<br><br>
He took the packed train, via Bank, to Angel, and ascended the longest single escalator on the tube network, to surface in Islington. 
Whilst tempted to run across the A1, to add to his list of "A Roads I have crossed dangerously" with the A4 and A5, he decided against 
it, and headed directly to the tearoom, Katsute 100. It was a lovely little Japanese tearoom, which Matthew would later take Freya 
to. He ordered a Genmaicha tea, which is a steamed sencha tea from Kyoto, with added toasted rice to give it a unique flavour. 
It was served in a beautiful earthenware Japanese teapot, with a ceramic gauze and 2 spouts, and was told he could refill the teapot 
with free hot water for a 2nd and 3rd cup. The tea was completely unique, but very nice, so he did so.
<br><br>
After sitting there, looking into the garden for an hour, going over the lecture content, he left, got back on the northern line, 
and changed at Bank, before descending deep into the abyss, and catching the DLR to Greenwich. He sat on the second row from the 
front, and had a fantastic view of the train climbing the steep and twisted tunnel to the surface, before rocketing along 
rollercoaster-like tracks above East London. The tracks undulated next to each other, for no apparent reason, and twisted and interwove 
into what must have been a knot. The track curved sharply to the right, and we wove in and amongst the skyscrapers of Canary Wharf, 
stopping at its magnificent (albeit very weird) station. The line then plunged underground to cross the river, and I alighted 
on the opposite bank, at Greenwich.
<br><br>
It took me a while to locate the Oyster validator, as I had not been aware that the DLR has mostly no ticket barriers. It then took 
me longer again to weave my way around the university of Greenwich to reach the National Maritime museum, to visit the Moon Exhibition 
(which I don't have the slightest clue as to why it was in a naval museum). Despite the steep ticket prices, I enjoyed.
<br><br>
I walked up the hill to the Royal Observatory, and admired the views of London. I then stood with one foot in either hemisphere! 
I had previously stood, in Iceland, with one foot in America and one in Europe, so this was a nice partner to that event. I then 
headed back down and returned to the DLR.
<br><br>
This time, I wormed my way to the front of the train, and filmed much of the (unfortunately, less exciting) journey home. I'd upload 
the video, but my camera skills leave something to be desired, and the video quality is shockingly awful. We descended back into 
the deep tunnel at Bank, where I caught the Central line home, after a fun day out.
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#x2135;<sub>10</sub>: Chesham (October 2019)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> 2 weeks into term, Matthew went on a very long Tube journey to Chesham, at the very end of the Metropolitan line. He saw many 
ducks. Again, a very lacklustre adventure compared to some of the others, but the distances involved are impressive.
<br><br>
On the second Friday of term, Matthew caught the Victoria line and changed to the Jubilee at Green Park. He then headed north, all 
the way to Dollis Hill (a zone 3 station, to allow him to maximise use of his travelcard). He alighted and went for a walk towards the 
hill, which was a lovely park (Gladstone Park), passing beautful Edwardian terraces on the way. He climbed the hill, admiring the 
views of London it afforded, and headed up to the ruined house at the summit. He bought himself a tea, and sat on a bench for a while 
before heading back down.
<br><br>
He then boarded the Jubilee, changed at Wembley Park to an Uxbridge-bound Met train. At Harrow-on-the-Hill, he changed to a Watford-bound 
Met train, and at Moor Park, he changed once more to a Chesham-bound Met train. After Moor Park, the miles and miles of leafy Metroland 
suburbia gave way to pockets of woodland between villages, before crossing the M25 and arriving in pure countryside. Even though 
he'd only been in London for 2 weeks, it felt like ages since he'd seen any countryside, and he was incredibly glad to see the forest 
once more. The line split after Chalfont and Latimer, and the single Chesham track curved gracefully along the pristine valley leading 
to the town. It was so strange being on a tube train in the middle of the countryside!
<br><br>
The train pulled into the station, which was filled with sweet flower beds and little gnomes. It even had a signal box. I left the 
station and headed into the small, quiet town centre. I saw the town clock, visited Waterstones and Sainsburys (where I stocked up 
with a huge amount of snacks, enough to scare me into recording all future purchases in a spreadsheet), and crossed the river to 
see the quaint half-timbered houses, the churchyard and the park. The greenery and serenity reminded me of a less rubbish version 
of home.
<br><br>
As rush hour dawned ever closer, I got back on the train, and headed to London. There, I changed at Harrow-on-the-Hill to an 
Uxbridge-bound Met train, which, as predicted, was packed. Luckily, at Rayners Lane, I changed once more to an eastbound Piccadilly 
train, which was silent. I went south through various quiet stations, including Sudbury Town, as I watched the sun set. I then 
alighted at North Ealing, which also looks like a quaint village halt, and walked through Ealing's Hanger Hill and Japanese 
neighbourhoods to West Acton on the central line, to head home. I enjoyed that last change so much that I sometimes go home from 
college by taking the Piccadilly to North Ealing, walking to West Acton, and taking the Central line home, just because of how serene 
the walk is.
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#x2135;<sub>11</sub>: Night Tube (October 2019)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> When Freya was down for the weekend, Matthew took her sight-seeing around London - at night. We saw many, many sights, both 
intended and unintended!
<br><br>
On a Friday afternoon in late October, exactly 4 weeks after we had last departed, Freya was coming down to London for the first time, 
to see me and stay over for the weekend. I left North Acton at about 3, and took the central line to Notting Hill Gate, before 
taking the Circle line to Victoria. Having scouted the station before, I followed my previous route through the station and down the 
street to Victoria Coach Station. However, Freya was not yet there - her coach was delayed. I went and bought her some flowers in 
the meantime, before heading back to see her for the first time in 4 weeks. All was right in the world again.
<br><br>
We headed back to my flat, and spent a few hours there. We eventually decided that we would try a Korean restaurant in Ealing, so 
we set off, arrived in Ealing Broadway, and walked through the town centre to the restaurant. We headed downstairs, sat at a table 
for two, and looked at the menu. I ordered fried udon noodles, and Freya bibimbap.
<br><br>
We ate our meal, sat and talked for a while, and then wrapped up warm and headed out into the cold of the night. It was roughly 10pm 
at this point, but we decided not to go home just yet - we wanted to go exploring in London first!
<br><br>
We caught the central line in Ealing Broadway and rode it all the way until Oxford Circus. The last time we had been to Oxford Circus, 
we'd barely been able to move, so we were quite surprised to find that the street was pretty desolate - there were only a few isolated 
groups around. Taking advantage of the lack of crowds, we walked up the street. Among many others, we passed Muji, Lush and Whittard, 
before arriving at Tottenham Court Road. We then doubled back, passing one of the country's largest Primarks.
<br><br>
We passed Oxford Circus again, before passing all of the famous giant department stores and the Disney store on our way towards Bond Street. 
We also witnessed a car drive the wrong way down a street, for some reason. We got back on the tube and headed to Piccadilly Circus. 
<br><br>
We disembarked and exited the station, and saw the dazzling neon displays, providing a backdrop to the Eros statue in front of us. 
We didn't spend long at Piccadilly Circus, as we'd been there during the summer, but I managed to see the giant illuminations 
at night for the first time, which has been something I've wanted to see for over a decade.
	</p>
	<center><img width="80%" src="./resources/photos/Piccadilly Circus.jpg"></center><br>
	<p>
We then took the Piccadilly to Green Park and the Jubilee to Westminster, where we ascended up the series of escalators to the 
surface. Westminster station has an absolutely vast, towering atrium, almost 50m high, filled with steel pipes and concrete 
balconies, alongside criss-crossing stairwells and entangled escalators. Freya said that the sci-fi ethos of the station, bedecked 
in polished chrome panels, contrasting against the masses of grey-beige concrete, reminded her of settings from first person 
shooter games. It is a really surreal station.
<br><br>
The station is so surreal that when we saw Big Ben just a few minutes later, Freya was seriously underwhelmed. It didn't help that the 
tower was covered in scaffolding. We both took each other's photo in front of the London Eye, and then crossed the Thames on 
Westminster bridge. We walked up to the London Eye, passed under Hungerford Bridge, and then headed towards Waterloo, to try and 
catch the Jubilee line towards home, as it was now very late.
<br><br>
Except we struggled to find the entrance to Waterloo tube station. The main station was barracaded off (it was about 1am), and all 
the tube entrances within sight were closed too. To my horror/upset, we were now in an unfamiliar bit of London, pretty lost, at 1am 
on a Satuday morning. This was terrible.
<br><br>
Thanks to Freya, we walked back to Westminster, across the eponymous bridge. We descended the steps to the river embankment, aiming 
to use the waterside entrance, only to be told by 2 men that we were unable to enter, and should use the main entrance.
<br><br>
We crossed the street to the main entrance, only to find numerous ambulances and paramedics stationed outside. Crap. This was bad. 
They were wheeling stretchers into the station building. We scurried inside to find them congregating in the corridor leading to 
the waterside exit. It looked as if someone had been stabbed, just minutes between us leaving that exit and us rearriving! That 
was truly terrifying. (Nothing appeared on the news afterwards though, so perhaps everything was alright... hopefully).
<br><br>
We went back down to the deep Jubilee platforms, and were greeted by dozens of tiny mice, scurrying back and forth along the platform. 
They ran up to each other, touched noses, and then started endlessly sniffing the platform in circles. Despite having been in London 
for 4 weeks, this was still one of my first times seeing mice on the tube, and both of us were very enamoured. When we arrived in 
Bond Street to await our train home, we saw even more, scurrying back and forth.
<br><br>
Our train arrived, now solidly into its Night Tube schedule, and we headed back to North Acton. It had been a very long evening 
(We were out even later than I would be 2 months later for ϙ1), and we were both tired.
<br><br>
We had a very eventful weekend after that. We went back to Oxford Street to visit the shops we'd picked out in the evening, and 
we went to Twinings on the Strand. We also went to Ichiba in Westfield London and Pizza Hut in Bayswater. Unfortunately, she had to 
depart on Sunday evening, which was very upsetting.
<br><br>
I will append to this account my train journey just 2 weeks later, to Bristol and Bath. I set off from North Acton at 6:30am, caught 
the 7am IET from Paddington, and went to Bristol Temple Meads, where I met Freya. Along the way, I'd admired the rolling hills and 
greenery of the railway's surroundings. It was a bitterly cold, freezing morning. We went to get coffee in the city centre, and 
spent the day wandering around, visiting various shops. All too quickly, however, it was time to depart, which was even more upsetting 
than it had been in London 2 weeks prior.
<br><br>
It had not been a hugely successful day for me either. I managed to lose one of my socks in the wash that morning (although I later 
rediscovered it, 4 weeks later), then left my phone charger on the train and my gloves on the tube in the evening. 
<br><br>
I did, however, have a very nice evening visiting Ewan in Bath (at short notice). Having eventually managed to catch a unibus, I 
headed up the hill to Bath Uni (the reader is forgiven for wondering whether NT secretly revolves around Bath), and saw Ewan and 
his flat. After many hours talking, we headed back into town, and ate at Pizza Express (see, I told you this was an NT adventure),
before my train arrived at 10pm, and I headed home once more.

<div class="content">
<p> So we all know that Cornwall is isolated, also we know that Public Transport is awful on a Sunday. James went down to the most 
isolated part of the UK, on a Sunday, what could go wrong? A lot.
</p>
<p> So it was a sunday, James had nothing to do, he had an idea to go to an amateur radio session. This story isn't long but it requires 
the certain level of masochism in the first place to consider it! The session was at Poldhu Cove, Lizard. If you know anything about the Lizard, 
you know that it is ridiculously hard to get to. Luckily James had an idea, he would cut the journey time, by getting a train to Redruth, brilliant,
amazing, he thought he was a genius. He arrives at Redruth, where is the bus? This is weird, the bus was supposed to leave in 5 minutes... until James hears:<br>
<em>Redruth Citizen</em>: A'wight bwuv, you lookin for L1.<br>
<em>James</em>: As it is, yes I am. <br>
<em>Crachead</em>: Left ten 'inits ago. Want some dope or cwac. <br>
<em>James Exits</em><br>
The man had no teeth, was wearing a fluffy wolf jumper, traditional Camruthful attire and seemed to be a drug dealer. Like a fat baker addicted to cakes.
From then he decided to get a taxi, he grabbed some cash and found some decent bloke to take him to Poldhu. The driver looked at him and then said:
<em>Drive</em>: £70<br>
<em>James:</em>: No. I'd rather walk<br>
<em> James walks back to the station </em><br>
<em>The taxi driver drives up</em><br>
<em>Drive</em>: £30<br>
<em>James</em>: £10<br>
<em>Drive</em>: £20<br>
<em>James</em>: £12<br>
<em>Drive</em>: £10<br>
<em>James, cheekily</em>: £10<br>
So James got to Poldhu and had his session, mainly trying to communicate with anybody he could. He then got back to Helston, time for nuttyness! So he went from 
Helston to Penryn, on the U4, which is usually a lot of fun, then a U2 to Redruth, James' regular bus service. Finally he got on a T2, <strong>T2 tucker!</strong>
(you can blame Lottie for that!) and then home.

<p> What could break James' Northophobia? What could break James' Terra Incognita? What could scare James shitless? That's right, 
it was time for MathJam Annual Gathering 2019, in Stone via Brummy. ft. James Grime, Matt Parker and a Quadruple Electrified Pacer! (Don't 
you worry the land only stopped a few miles north of Stone, so James didn't dare go any more North)
</p>
<p>Good Morning! I am off to Annual Maths Jam Gathering today. This is held in Stone and I will be taking my favourite mode of 
transport, the train! Join me, on the adventure and remember, This isn't tourism, this is masochism!</p>
<p> There will be updates throughout the day, so keep an eye on this space</p>
<p><b><em> Update 1: 1019 CBN </em></b></p>
<p>I am at Camborne ready and raring to go! I can see the 800 arriving from the distance let's go!</p>
<p> I have taken my seat, let's go! </p>

These are the woes of Rail Replacement Bus week:<br>
No trains, only buses <br>
He got stuck in Helston on Monday morning and had to make a connection down on the Lizard to get to Truro, creating and running the least efficient 
path to Truro, known to man, EVER! He got there though at 10am, screwed all lectures for the day and went and saw Lottie.

<p> It had all been planned so well. He finished his work on time, caught exactly the right train, and amazingly, found both sets 
of library doors open - it was Matthew's lucky <s>day</s> night!
<br><br>
An hour and a half later, he was sprinting down High Street Kensington at half past 2 in the morning, simultaneously shivering from 
the cold, sweating from sprinting, and crying about his life, hoping to God he could catch the night bus. Why?
