<p> NT adventures are for special occasions, when we find time (and money) to meet up for some critical-density nuttiness. This 
unfortunately means that we are only to meet up on a select few occasions each year (and our list of adventures testifies). 
Fear not, however, as we still get up to plenty of nuttiness on our own! The Aleph adventures are a special section of the website, 
dedicated to such solo adventures. And if you hadn't guessed from the name of this page, there are a lot of these adventures! 
Therefore, this list is unlikely to ever be complete. However, these will hopefully include some of our more interesting adventures, 
as opposed to our run-of-the-mill ones: Matthew finding 3000 different detours around London because he was too impatient to wait 
3 minutes for the Circle line, and James watching his fellow residents of Camborne take various drugs. Enjoy this bonus nuttiness!

<button type="button" class="collapsible"><sub>0</sub>&#x5D0;: Aleph Null(I couldn't resist!): The Olympics (Summer 2012)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> We have written the story of James's first encounter with a train, but the story of Matthew's first encounter with a train remains 
unwritten... until the time when I can be bothered!
</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">1&#x5D0;: Matthew's study leave mistake (Summer 2017)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> During study leave one day, Matthew decided to go home on the train, which was a first. Unfortunately, he made some critical 
mistakes.
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">2&#x5D0;: Operation Swanedi (September 2017)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> This is easily worthy of a position in NT. For some reason, Matthew decided to get on a train at 2am in the morning, wander 
hopelessly around Swansea until 4, and then go back home. Why? Just Why?<br>
I will also append my first brief encounter with a Class 800, on only its first day of operation, just a few weeks later!
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">3&#x5D0;: Operation Trostrail (December 2017)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> Matthew decided it was a great idea to catch a train to Llanelli, and just walk to Parc Trostre from there, through various 
rotten bits of Llanelli. Definitely a great idea.
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">4&#x5D0;: Bristol Open Day (September 2018)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> Matthew and Freya caught a very early train to Bristol (via Bristol Parkway), to go to the Bristol Uni open day. This turned 
out to be a very important day for us, despite the mad dash for the train home.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">5&#x5D0;: Valley Lines 0 (September 2018)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> Matthew and his friend Ewan went to the fabled station of Nantgarw for a MAT session, but on the way, Matthew made the fatal 
error of jumping on the first valley train he saw... without checking the destination. Hmm. This sounds familiar...
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">6&#x5D0;: Bath 3 (October 2018)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> Matthew and Ewan then went on a trip to the University of Bath open day. Our journey involved a rail replacement bus journey, 
a surprise visit to Patchway, and Matthew spilling his lunch/burning hot tea down himself. Just a normal day then, really!
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">7&#x5D0;: Greenwich + DLR (October 2018)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> In fresher's week, Matthew took the tube to a Japanese teahouse near The Angel, before taking the DLR from Bank to Greenwich 
to see an exibition about the moon. The DLR was like a rollercoaster!
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">8&#x5D0;: Chesham (October 2019)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> 2 weeks into term, Matthew went on a very long Tube journey to Chesham, at the very end of the Metropolitan line. He saw many 
ducks.
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">9&#x5D0;: Night Tube (October 2019)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> When Freya was down for the weekend, Matthew took her sight-seeing around London - at night. We saw many, many sights, both 
intended and unintended!
</p>
