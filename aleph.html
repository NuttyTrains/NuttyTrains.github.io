<p> NT adventures are for special occasions, when we find time (and money) to meet up for some critical-density nuttiness. This 
unfortunately means that we are only to meet up on a select few occasions each year (and our list of adventures testifies). 
Fear not, however, as we still get up to plenty of nuttiness on our own! The Aleph adventures are a special section of the website, 
dedicated to such solo adventures. And if you hadn't guessed from the name of this page, there are a lot of these adventures! 
Therefore, this list is unlikely to ever be complete. However, these will hopefully include some of our more interesting adventures, 
as opposed to our run-of-the-mill ones: Matthew finding 3000 different detours around London because he was too impatient to wait 
3 minutes for the Circle line, and James watching his fellow residents of Camborne take various drugs. Enjoy this bonus nuttiness!

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#x2135;<sub>0</sub>: Aleph Null(I couldn't resist!): The Olympics (Summer 2012)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> We have written the story of James's first encounter with a train, but the story of Matthew's first encounter with a train remains 
unwritten... until the time when I can be bothered!
</p>
</div>
	  
<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#x2135;<sub>1</sub>: Matthew's study leave mistake (Summer 2017)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> During study leave one day, Matthew decided to go home on the train, which was a first. Unfortunately, he made some critical 
mistakes.
	<br><br>
This is quite a short adventure, but still an amusing story. It was study leave in Year 11, in early June. By this point, some 
people had finished all their exams, and everyone left had only 1 or 2 to go (Matthew had 4 or 5, if memory serves me correctly), 
so naturally, everyone was spending most of their time pissing around and being clique. This didn't please Matthew, so at 1 o'clock, 
he decided to go home on the train, which he had never actually done before.
	<br><br>
Matthew signed out on the register, and walked down the crescent, turned onto Walter Road, and walked towards the train station. 
It was a reasonably short walk, which took 20-ish minutes (Matthew's walking pace was slower back then), before he arrived at the 
station and went to the ticket office.
	<br><br>
Matthew: Can I have a child single to Neath please?
Ticket Lady: Are you sure you won't be coming back? A return is much cheaper than 2 singles<br>
Matthew: <em> I'm sure </em>
	<br><br>
Matthew caught the train and triumphantly arrived in Neath, happy that he had managed to get home and avoid another 3 hours of pissing 
about and cliqueiness. We walked home, only to find that there was no car in the drive, and no-one was home. This was a problem. 
He decided instead to walk up the hill to his grandparents' house, only to find they were also absent. This was a big problem.
Here, I ought to explain why I have included this as an NT adventure:
	<br><br>
Matthew had brought money that day, anticipating that he might want to catch the train.<br>
However, Matthew had not brought his keys, as he assumed that someone would be home to let him in (in his defense, it was half past 2, 
and Ffynone didn't finish until 4, so this was a reasonable assumption).<br>
Furthermore, he had no mobile phone, so was unable to contact anyone to say where he was.<br>
So now you see why this was a problem.
	<br><br>
With no way to get into the house, neither any means of contacting anyone to say where he was, the outcome of the scenario would 
have been distinctly unpleasant. So Matthew was forced to go back to the train station, and buy another ticket!
	<br><br>
Matthew: Can I have a child single to Swansea?<br>
Ticket Lady: Would you like a return?<br>
Matthew: No, this time I am sure I only want a single.
	<br><br>
The train arrived in Swansea at about 25 to 4, giving only 15 minutes before his mum would pull up on the hashed yellow lines, 
expecting him to be out immediately (which, by the way, never happened). So he ran. He ran for as long as he could (not very long 
at the time), and powerwalked the rest, back though the city, back up the hill, back along Walter Road (running into his music 
teacher along the way), and up to the school, seeing his mum parked, as predicted, on the hashed yellow lines, waiting impatiently. 
He dived into the car (before 5 to 4), received his daily bollocking for being late, and headed home. Again.
	<br><br>
The moral of this traumatic experience for Matthew was to always carry his keys and his phone. As with everything, he learnt the 
hard way.

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#x2135;<sub>2</sub>: Operation Swanedi (September 2017)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> This is easily worthy of a position in NT. For some reason, Matthew decided to get on a train at 2am in the morning, wander 
hopelessly around Swansea until 4, and then go back home. Why? Just Why? (Much to James' worry)<br>
I will also append my first brief encounter with a Class 800, on only its first day of operation, just a few weeks later!

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#x2135;<sub>3</sub>: STEP time! (September - May 2017/18)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> So you know that it takes two hours to get to Exeter on the train? Well James did this every saturday for
four months to get a couple of STEP qualifications, just for fun. He is still yet to do STEP III.
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#x2135;<sub>4</sub>: Operation Trostrail (December 2017)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> Matthew decided it was a great idea to catch a train to Llanelli, and just walk to Parc Trostre from there, 
through various rotten bits of Llanelli. Definitely a great idea.
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#x2135;<sub>5</sub>: Tube and Tab (March 2018)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> So James had a interview in Lonon for IBM, this meant that he had to go to London, join him on his way through 
the tube, the second time ever and first on my own. Then to the splendeur of Tab. Getting lost shanked and then to top me off, getting to go home
via Waterloo.
</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#x2135;<sub>6</sub>: Bristol Open Day (September 2018)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> Matthew and Freya caught a very early train to Bristol (via Bristol Parkway), to go to the Bristol Uni open day. This turned 
out to be a very important day for us, despite the mad dash for the train home.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#x2135;<sub>7</sub>: Valley Lines 0 (September 2018)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> Matthew and his friend Ewan went to the fabled station of Nantgarw for a MAT session, but on the way, Matthew made the fatal 
error of jumping on the first valley train he saw... without checking the destination. Hmm. This sounds familiar...
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#x2135;<sub>8</sub>: Bath 3 (October 2018)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> Matthew and Ewan then went on a trip to the University of Bath open day. Our journey involved a rail replacement bus journey, 
a surprise visit to Patchway, and Matthew spilling his lunch/burning hot tea down himself. Just a normal day then, really!
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#x2135;<sub>9</sub>: Greenwich + DLR (October 2019)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> In fresher's week, Matthew took the tube to a Japanese teahouse near The Angel, before taking the DLR from Bank to Greenwich 
to see an exibition about the moon. The DLR was like a rollercoaster!
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#x2135;<sub>10</sub>: Chesham (October 2019)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> 2 weeks into term, Matthew went on a very long Tube journey to Chesham, at the very end of the Metropolitan line. He saw many 
ducks.
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#x2135;<sub>11</sub>: Night Tube (October 2019)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> When Freya was down for the weekend, Matthew took her sight-seeing around London - at night. We saw many, many sights, both 
intended and unintended!
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#x2135;<sub>.---- ..---</sub>: Nutty Busses (November 2019)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> So we all know that Cornwall is isolated, also we know that Public Transport is awful on a Sunday. James went down to the most 
isolated part of the UK, on a Sunday, what could go wrong? A lot.
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">&#x2135;<sub>13</sub>: Uppa North (November / December 2019)</button>
<div class="content">
<p> What could break James' Northophobia? What could break James' Terra Incognita? What could scare James shitless? That's right, 
it was time for MathJam Annual Gathering 2019, in Stone via Brummy. ft. James Grime, Matt Parker and a Quadruple Electrified Pacer! (Don't 
you worry the land only stopped a few miles north of Stone, so James didn't dare go any more North)
