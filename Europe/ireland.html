    GUINNESS
    <br><br>
    <strong>WELCOME TO THE GUINNESS AMNESIA ZONE!</strong>
    <br><br>
    The 11th adventure on our amnesia zone saga marks our entry into 2023... just in time for 2025 (I <i>will</i> remain less than 2 years behind schedule Goddamnit!). 
    This time we were off on another multi-day adventure, except for the first time in history, NT (read: James) was leaving Blighty - it was time to visit Ireland! 
    I do not claim to remember much here, and my usual crutches of video footage and lists of stations no longer exist here, so join me as I march into the void!
    <br><br>
    -------------
    By halfway through 4th year, the true horror of the workload of MMSC had struck James, and consequently the frequency of NT adventures began to dry up, despite 
    us living only 60-90 minutes apart. Therefore, when one of us snapped, we wanted to ho on a <i>real</i> adventure - fuck Reading again. What magnificent 
    destination could we travel to? The south coast? Birmingham? The North? No, Matthew was quite frankly sick of the UK, having now realised that he actually possessed 
    free will (future Matthew: you ought to remember this too), so he proposed a radical idea: Ireland. Ireland may not seem too exciting, and would certainly not be 
    Matthew's #1 travel destination of choice ordinarily, but Ireland possesses one key advantage over every other foreign country... Brits do not require passports 
    to go there!
    <br><br>
    The original plan for this adventure was to fly with Ryanair from Stansted to Dublin, but this is where Matthew's magnificent plan hit a snag. Ryanair <i>do</i> 
    require passports, even on their Common Travel Area flights. Matthew attempted to explain this law to the Ryanair customer service agent on the phone, but he 
    did not seem to understand what Matthew was trying to say. Consequently, with less than 48 hours to go, we had to change all our plans - we rebooked onto an 
    Aer Lingus flight from Heathrow, which at least made our lives ever so slightly easier - not that you'd know that from the below messages...

Ugh<br>
This is a  bad idea <br>
I want to die.<br>

I have bad news, so I have been standing at this bus stop for 15 mins<br>
No OxTube has turned up

<b>James — 19/03/2023 04:33</b><br>
Ok so change of plan<br>
Meet me at Heathrow

Heathrow is a fantastic airport to fly from because it is so goddamn efficient<br>
It is the world's Clapham Junction - everything passes through here
</div>
<p>
    The previous night, we had both made the super-intelligent decision to go out - James in Oxford and Matthew in Dalston (returning to Stratford to sleep). This 
    meant neither of us got decent sleep and both of us had long commutes to make it to Heathrow. Matthew in particular left it very fine, arriving at the tube 
    station with less than an hour until departure (hence my glowing review of the airport above). Of course, this was assisted by my decision to only bring a 
    tote bag, which is pretty astonishing minimalism, if I do say so myself.
    <br><br>
    Our first time on a plane together was really cool actually. James had had serious reservations about travelling to a foreign country for the first time, 
    and even more serious reservations about getting in a thin metal tube in the sky (not helped by his parents), but once we were in the air, the magic of 
    fluid dynamics won him over - "planes are pretty cool" - Sam from Wendover, 2015-.
    <br><br>
    The flight gave us a beautiful view of the Irish Sea and Dublin as we approached the airport. We touched down, collected James' bag and headed for the city itself. 
    Dublin airport has no train station (alas), so the available options for onward transport are coaches and buses. Matthew was feeling particularly miserly after 
    having to pay for 2 flights, so we chose the latter, and wound our way into the city centre on a local bus. Yes, dear readers - a local bus that took an hour 
    and gave us a glorious view of petrol stations, suburban housing, and Dublin traffic. It was at this moment that James realised he had been tricked - Dublin 
    wasn't foreign at all! Everything was exactly like the UK...
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    I shall confess that at this point, my memories begin to fail me. I know that we disembarked on a major street in the city centre, and were immediately 
    greeted by the DART trams (which were very cool), but I do not quite remember the order of subsequent events. It is possible that we went straight to our hotel 
    to drop off our bags, or we might have messed around for a little bit. I guess it doesn't matter enormously. What matters more is that by mid-morning, we were 
    having a nice time exploring Dublin city centre - we passed the Whiskey museum, we visited a lovely park, we had a nice joyride on DART, we saw the offices of 
    the Irish PM and parliament, visited a natural history museum, and probably did some other stuff that I do not quite remember. We passed some famous pubs, 
    but we decided it was too early to start drinking, so we retired to our hotel, where we watched over an hour of the <i>most interesting film</i> we had 
    ever seen - it was some film about an English lady in Siam, and for some reason, it was utterly fascinating, like a car crash in slow motion.
    <br><br>
    Note to James if he is reading this: redheads<br>
    Context for other readers if you are reading this: there were a lot of redheads
    <br><br>
    In the evening, we took the DART all the way to the Guinness museum, which was quite expensive, but honestly, totally worth it. If a museum can hold James' 
    attention for more than 2 hours, you know it must be really good. It walked us through the entire Guinness production process, talked about the history of 
    Guinness (including an exhibit on famous mathematicians employed by Guinness - long-time readers will recall that the Student's T-test was invented at the 
    Guinness brewery in Park Royal, near Acton), culminating in a rooftop bar where you could sample Guinness whilst overlooking the city. James was fully in his 
    element, as everyone was very interested in speaking to him - James and Guinness is a powerful combination! And even though Matthew 
    wasn't very keen on Guinness (it was his first time), he had to admit that the view was absolutely fantastic. What a way to end the day!
    <br><br>
    James: I feel really full after this Guinness - I am not hungry at all!<br>
    Matthew: Thank God, I no longer need to feed you - I just need to get you a few pints of Guinness!
    <br><br>
    Day 2 began with a trip to Dublin station - we had seen more-or-less everything we wanted to see in Dublin, so now it was time for our <i>true</i> nutty plan. 
    What if we could visit almost every city in Ireland, and perform a circulation of nearly the entire country in just 1 weekend??? Therefore, we boarded the train 
    with our stupidly cheap tickets (I think we were encircling the country for ~£40 each), and we were off, on the long, long way to Tipperary.
    <br><br>
    We did not stop at Tipperary. Instead, we continued straight to Waterford, where Matthew had some unfinished business from 14 years ago. Matthew had visited 
    Ireland in 2009, and recalled a trip to Waterford. The idea had been to visit the crystal glass factory (for which Waterford is famed), but for some reason or 
    another, this had proven impossible. Instead, his only memory of the town was a visit to Tesco - riveting. He felt this needed to be rectified.
    <br><br>
    We have been to some inconveniently located stations in the past, but Waterford possibly takes the biscuit. Waterford is situated on the banks of a pretty 
    enormous river - it must be about as wide as the Thames in London, and almost as wide as the Loire main branch at Saumur. The town is located entirely on one bank of this 
    river, and the station is squeezed alongside the other bank. The bridge across the river is not terribly far from the station, but it is a fairly substantial 
    walk from the main part of the town centre. Hence, we had a decent walk ahead of us. We headed across the river and into town, where we almost certainly 
    had lunch. Do I remember having lunch? No. However, as evidenced by the fact that I am alive and well writing this account, then this implies I was not hurled 
    into that enormous river by a hungry James, which implies that feeding time took place at some unknown location at some unknown time.
    <br><br>
    Speaking of time, we headed there next - to the Museum of Time, Waterford! This was a really cool museum actually - definitely worth a visit if you like 
    clocks and similar devices. Even James was able to pass the time there!
    <br><br>
    WAIT I REMEMBER THE FOOD! It was in some kind of bar/pub - Matthew tried Irish Whiskey for the first time (Jameson). Many people say that Guinness 
    tastes better in Ireland (James included), but I swear to God - Jameson definitely tastes better in Ireland: it doesn't taste remotely as good over here :(
    <br><br>
    We reached the crystal glass factory soon after, and found that it was either closed permanently or had just closed for the day - RIP. I guess Matthew will have 
    to wait another 14 years until 2037 to visit again :'(. To console himself, Matthew went to visit a Viking tower to learn about more history, and James returned 
    to a pub we'd spotted earlier for a spot of Guinness - yum.
    <br><br>
    Cutting it ever so slightly fine, we returned to the train station and caught our train towards Limerick. This was a fairly long train, and by the time we reached 
    Limerick Junction, it was beginning to get dark. Even so, we both noticed that the landscape had changed subtlely. On the east coast, things were fairly 
    indistinguishable from the west coast of the UK, but this far west, we were perhaps seeing what they meant by 'the Emerald Isle': it was picturesque and unspoilt, 
    with gentle rolling green in all directions. We only had 10 minutes to wait here, so perhaps we'd have a less rosy picture if we had been stuck in the middle 
    of nowhere for 2 hours!
    <br><br>
    From Limerick Junction it was but a short journey north to Limerick. Limerick is meant to be a nice place, but we weren't terribly impressed. Perhaps it was the 
    darkness and mizzle, and perhaps it was the rundown streets we saw, but Limerick didn't leap out at us. We had just over an hour here, which was <i>barely</i> 
    enough to squeeze in Pizza Express, before we jogged our way back to the train station. I don't remember very much at all about this place, given the number 
    of places we have visited over the years for dinner and dinner only, but I do remember seeing the inky black River Shannon stretch out for as far as the eye 
    could see (mainly because it was very dark and the other bank was poorly lit) - our riverside restaurant seemed as if it had a seaview! The highlight of the 
    place was easily the Terry Wogan statue.
    <br><br>
    We had 1 last train for the night: the Irish equivalent of a pacer for 2 hours, visiting every tiny hamlet with 3 people in the middle of bumfuck nowhere. 
    This was not very amusing, and we were pretty sick of it by the time we finally rocked up in Galway, fully expecting that this would be the end of the day. We 
    were even less amused to learn that the next bus to our hotel was ages away. This was not the best first impression of Galway.
    <br><br>
    ... but first impressions can be misleading!
    <br><br>
    Long story short, Galway was amazing, and despite what happened on Sunday afternoon (read on!), I stand by that statement - I would happily visit that place 
    again. During Oui Oui Deux, about 1 year later, we met a Dutch couple who had lived in Galway, and they agreed - there is a little bit of magic to that place! 
    Almost immediately after finding our bus was delayed, we walked into the large square outside the station, and began to hear music... we gravitated towards the 
    pub in question (the Skeff Bar), headed inside, and quite frankly had a fantastic night. That 2 hour pacer journey had all been worth it. Galway was great. We felt 
    like we were home, and for once in my life I mean that positively! If anyone reading this is thinking of going to Ireland - go to Galway; you won't regret it!
    <br><br>
    I even interviewed James about Galway, who famously does not have the best memory of places we have been:<br>
    James:<br>
    If James remembers a place fondly, you <i>know</i> it must be good!
    <br><br>
    Our hotel was quite far away from the town centre, but the bus driver was kind enough to give us a free ride. Our hotel was astonishingly fancy - somewhat 
    reminiscent of the Celtic Manor resort. It had a spa and a swimming pool! I have no recollection of any of that quite frankly - yada yada, welcome to the 
    anmesia zone - but I definitely vividly remember waiting for the bus the next morning to return to Galway, standing in the pissing rain. Unfortunately, dear 
    viewers, Galway is on the west coast of Ireland, which brings along <i>bucketloads</i> of rain - so much rain that it is astonishing even to a Welshman 
    and a Cornishman! Do <i>not</i> come to Galway if you hate the rain!
    <br><br>
    Rain aside, we had a nice morning wandering through the historic mediaeval town centre, and seeing all the shops and market stalls. We popped into a cosy pub 
    with a fire, Guinness and Whiskey, and settled in for while. <i>A long while.</i> James had found himself some company with a travelling musician - a lovely 
    bloke, but him and James <i>could not stop talking!</i> We must have been in that pub for 4 hours, and after a little while, I walked out - my social battery 
    was running pretty low. In the meantime, I had a nice wander around the Latin Quarter (albeit in the rain) - not 100% certain what was Latin about it. I returned 
    to find James and his newfound friend still chatting, and I started to watch the clock tick down until our train. James was pretty content to stay put, despite 
    my warnings that this was the last train leaving Galway before we would miss our flight. His friend was more than willing to enable this. Eventually I dragged 
    him out of the pub and we walked over to the train station (we did not run, dear readers), made it to the platform... and watched the train leave without us.
    <br><br>
    I very seldom lose my temper on these adventures (unless in jest), but shamefully, I blew my lid this time. I was <i>not</i> a fun person to be around for 
    the rest of the day, as we found a coach to take us to Dublin Airport and headed straight back to the airport - no more trains on this adventure. James 
    will probably testify that I was a complete bastard that afternoon - perhaps I was.
    <br><br>
    We flew back to Heathrow and went our various ways after James lost their beloved yellow hat on the plane. 
    I remember nothing about the journey back, presumably because after making it back to Kensal Green, I went to drown my sorrows at Maggie's Bar, my local 
    Irish Pub. When you can't go back to Ireland, you bring Ireland to you.
