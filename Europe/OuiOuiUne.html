    <strong>BIENVENUE DANS LA ZONE D'AMNÉSIE!</strong>
    <br><br>
    This 14th adventure on our epic quest marks the start of a new chapter - no, not the chapter where I remember things, or the adventures 
    that I actually wrote up in reasonable time, but the start of the post-Imperial/Oxford adventures. Separated by hundreds of miles, feeling 
    far less spritely than in the past, but armed with passports, we figured that if we wanted to meet up, it was equally easy and expensive to 
    meet on the continent as it was to meet in the UK... wait a minute, that was a fantastic idea!
    <br><br>
    Unfortunately adventures become significantly rarer from this point onwards due to the aforementioned time and cost (doing a poorly-paid PhD 
    is not the best decision if one wishes to optimise these variables), but hopefully they become significantly more exciting! 
    <br><br>
    This adventure is actually a mere excerpt from the 2 grand tours that we were both embarking upon. James will have documented their travel 
    somewhere (probably instagram - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/j_a_arthur_/">follow them there</a>), but Matthew's time remains completely 
    undocumented, so I shall give a very brief rundown of what he was up to, before we move onto the main event - the very few items I recall from 
    our Paris extravaganza: on y va!
    <br><br>
    -------------
    <br><br>
    Having just sat my Hydrostab exam (my last Imperial exam), I decided to embark upon a grand Interrail tour around France. I had always wanted to do an Interrail 
    trip (and had very nearly booked to go in 2019 and 2020), and now that I was freed from my 4 years at Imperial, I decided to seize the opportunity and plan 
    a last minute 'grande boucle' around France. Therefore, on the 19th of September I flew out to Marseille Provence from Heathrow (after a week or so in London), 
    and took a coach into Marseille itself, then took the metro over to my hostel in Vieux-Port and went to have dinner in the port. I explored Marseille at night 
    (perhaps a dangerous proposition), and I remember attempting to buy a EU-UK plug adapter (as I had foolishly forgotten mine) after my phone died - very safe. 
    Marseille is probably the place I realised that I really want to learn French...

    The next day I explored Marseille - I wandered around the Vieux-Port, over to the cathedral and Grotte Cosquer - this was an awesome attraction about an underground 
    paleolithic cave system and cave art. I really enjoyed. I also enjoyed seeing Fort St Jean, but unfortunately the Roman Docks museum was closed. This was also the day 
    that I realised that this entire trip had been planned during the Rugby World Cup in France - oops. That at least explained why everything was busy and all the hostels 
    were packed! I spent my evening climbing the hill up to the basilica at the top. I arrived too late to enter, so I spent the evening watching the sunset over Marseille 
    and going exploring in the area called Pharo - I could not find the lighthouse, but I did find a palace! The day after, I wished to spend the morning visiting the 
    history museum in Marseille, but it was also closed, so I saw the limited gallery that was open and instead sat outside Marseille St Charles station at some café, 
    having a coffee before my 6 hour train to Bordeaux. This train was actually excellent - this was the moment I learned that French trains were much better than UK trains!
    <br><br>
    Oui Oui Une was meant to begin in Bordeaux - before I flew out, we had booked a hotel in Bordeaux and had booked a wine tour to a chateau in the Medoc area. 
    Unfortunately, James was imminently about to begin their PhD, and their first supervision meeting (which was mandatory) clashed with our Bordeaux trip, so at 
    the very last minute, we cancelled the hotel, I rebooked myself into a hostel and my solo trip continued! Bordeaux is a beautiful city with a cool tram network. 
    I spent my time wandering around the old city, enjoying myself in various squares with an espresso and a croissant and seeing the sights. On the 22nd I went on 
    that wine tour alone, just missing King Charles' visit to Bordeaux at the same time! I no longer remember specifics from this tour, but James was very upset that 
    they missed this. Writing this whilst on a TGV on Oui Oui Trois, it kind of sucks that we missed out on the first wine tour of this series - we could have visited 
    the Gironde as well as the Loire and the Rhône! James also missed out on the Cité du Vin, the fantastic wine museum in Bordeaux. We shall have to revisit it. 
    On the 23rd I took my first ever TGV from Bordeaux St Jean to Paris Montparnasse, which was truly amazing. If I hadn't been sold on interrailing before, I 
    certainly was now!

    As you can see from the above messages, James was not having a particularly great time. Having located the Eiffel Tower, they immediately started plotting how to 
    leave Paris and escape back to the countryside. In a moment of great foreshadowing, their first plan was to escape to Pouilly-sur-Loire, but train schedules 
    foiled this attempt. Instead, on the 23rd, they decided to escape to Courtrai (also a moment of foreshadowing). Readers should take note of this. All of our 
    French adventures will play out in exactly this fashion - we will meet in a city, James will immediately try to escape, and when it is time to leave, Matthew 
    will cling on for dear life: city rat and country bumpkin on tour. 
    <br><br>
    James had a much better time in Kortijk. After a brief panic about crossing the border without their passport, and another panic about encountering the rugby 
    lads on tour, they had a great time in a bar that served Belgian beer and played English music - proper job! To Matthew's complete surprise, James has since 
    revisited Belgium (especially Brussels) multiple times since, and <i>enjoys it</i>??? James was not such a fan of Lille as it was so rammed they could not locate the 
    train station, even when stood right next to it - the Rugby World Cup was not the best time to visit France... All good things had to come to an end though - it was 
    time to meet in Paris for the actual start of Oui Oui Une! It was time to head to Hôtel F1 near Porte d'Orleans...

    James was also not a fan of Hôtel F1. Our hotel was right near the Peripherique ring road that encircles the city which in turn meant it was right next to the 
    banlieue (and a cemetery). This trip was off to a fantastic start. At least we had wine on that first night - an entire carafe between us. We staggered back to 
    the hotel with no en-suite bathroom, looking for rats.
    <br><br>
    <strong>New character time! Introducing REMI le RAT, notre ami. STOP AUX RATS!</strong>
    <br><br>
    The next day was a Sunday - hash day. We both left the hotel, bought RATP day passes, hopped on the tram near our hotel, then caught the RER B into the city. At 
    this point we wandered for a bit - we went through the Latin Quarter and near Notre Dame (still under reconstruction), retracing some of Adam's steps from Jet Lag. In 
    this area we also managed to see Rue Lagrange, and James bought themself a beret! Hon hon hon! We crossed the river towards the Louvre (James for some reason appreciated  
    neither the smell of piss on the river bank, nor Matthew's insistence that in 12 months' time, Olympic athletes would swim in that river - quelle domage!), and split up 
    to do our various things. My camera reel suggests that this was the day that I walked along the Seine, past Cleopatra's Needle, walked up the Champs-Elysees, and then 
    climbed the Arc du Triomphe followed by the Eiffel Tower. I also had escargot for lunch, mainly to horrify everyone else. I am pretty sure my phone died whilst halfway up 
    the Eiffel Tower, which was fine, as I had been a total miser and had refused to pay for a lift - I had walked halfway, taken some photos, and gone home. Meanwhile, James 
    went on the hash. This nicely illustrates our differing approaches to Paris - Matthew turned traitor and became a stereotypical tourist, whilst James remained resolutely 
    British - On On!

    James eventually found their way to a café on the opposite bank to the Eiffel Tower, where Matthew eventually joined him. The rest of the evening is a bit of a 
    blur admittedly, and I am not totally sure what we did apart from riding the elevated section of line 6 (which is very cool). I think we went to see the minature 
    Statue of Liberty and attempted to get on the RER C but got fucked. We probably also visited Arts et Metiers station (the steampunk one) at some point. No idea when, 
    but you people seem to like train content, so that's the best I can do. We rode quite a few different lines on the metro whilst in Paris: I know we did line 1 
    (with the platform screen doors), but I was on holiday so I deliberately did not keep track of where we went, when, or why. This made my life much easier at the time, 
    but much harder now when writing this in 2025. Fuck you past Matthew.

    What I do know is that at 10pm or something stupid, we set out from our hotel to ride the 2 
    very short stub lines on the metro - 7bis and 3bis. These 2 lines were once branches of their parent lines, but have since been cleaved off into their own 
    mini lines. By this point it was very late, and James was worried that we wouldn't be able to make it in time. Matthew assured them that yes, we would be able to 
    make it to both lines before they closed. To save time, we did only part of the loop on 7bis, transferred to line 11, then did 3bis on the penultimate or the 
    final train. Pleased with our efforts, we exited the train at Gambetta, whereupon James asked Matthew which trains we'd be taking home. Matthew replied "None - 
    the last train has now departed, like I said". This did not please James. When James had asked whether or not we had time to complete both 7bis and 3bis before 
    they closed for the night, Matthew had replied in the affirmative: yes, we could. This is because James had failed to specify that they actually wished to do 
    7bis, 3bis <i>and</i> go home before the trains stopped. Such minor matters did not cross Matthew's mind - of course <i>making it home</i> would be impossible - 
    was that not implicit? James was furious. Unwittingly, Matthew had lured them out into the big city at night <i>again</i>, and now it was night bus time!
    <br><br>
    <strong>"I visit lots of places, but the only times I ever end up on the night bus are when I am with you"</strong>
    <br><br>
    After 3 night buses, a lot of walking, and a post-2am arrival into the hotel, James would never be fooled like this again...
    <br><br>
    Monday 25th is also a bit of a mystery to the author. I am not entirely certain what we spent the morning doing apart from having a coffee near our hotel and then 
    travelling to the Louvre to see the pyramid. I know we wished to visit Laplace station (to match Rue Lagrange), but this eluded us. Honestly, after our very late night 
    the previous night, we probably slept in and only got out of bed around lunch time. After the Louvre (pyramid, not the museum), we went to Galerie Lafayette - this 
    was much more James' style! We went to see some of the very rare wine that was on sale (they had a Château d'Yquem 1899!!), had a wine tasting (a harbinger of things 
    to come!) and also perused all the fresh produce on offer. We then presumably did something or other for the duration of the day... honestly, not sure.
    <br><br>
    In the evening we decided to have a race to Montmartre for sunset - Matthew on line 4, James on line 13. I'll let the discord messages explain this one...

Better to see the sunset
</div>
<p>
    Matthew enjoyed Montmartre a lot. Running up the stairs was great exercise, watching the sunset was beautiful, and the interior of the cathedral was very peaceful. 
    We both then enjoyed one of the ultimate highlights of the trip: Remy hunting. The area by the cathedral was <i>filled</i> with rats. It was a true sight to behold, 
    just like Pixar had promised us. We tried tempting them out of their holes with tasty snacks, and caught extensive footage of this on camera - the only footage from 
    this entire trip. Hopefully this cinematic masterpiece sees the light of day...
    <br><br>
    We ended our day having a very nice meal up on Montmartre. Stereotypical and expensive? Absolutely. Worth it to end the nightmare that was the masters year? 100%.

<p>
    On our final day in Paris, we headed towards the Jardin du Luxembourg. Matthew wanted to see the Panthéon and the Foucault pendulum (James did too, but Matthew hadn't 
    shared these plans with James as he assumed they wouldn't be interested). It was exceptional. If Matthew is ever able to drag James back to Paris, 
    we shall redo this, alongside all the remaining things he has yet to tick off in Paris. He also got to see some of the tombs - including Lagrange! 
    <br><br>
    Finally, we parted ways. James headed to Epernay and Matthew travelled to Lyon to complete his grande boucle. Matthew took a TGV down to Lyon, dropped his stuff in 
    the hostel (after taking a trolleybus part of the way), and went out into Lyon to explore. I saw the traboules at some point on this trip (possibly day 1), the 
    amphitheatre of the three Gauls, and some of the artwork that fills Croix-Rousse: a very trendy area of Lyon. I then crossed the river towards Vieux Lyon and explored 
    the old city and took the funicular up to Fourvière to admire the magnificent cathedral and watch the sunset over the city. By this point, the Roman museum and 
    theatres were closed, but I was able to overlook them: I had never seen anything on their scale before! I decided to torture myself yet again and climb up the hill, 
    but treated myself to a funicular ride on the way down, which was very cool - almost as cool as the metro line C that passed my hostel (see the video attached below). 
    <br><br>
    The biggest downside of this trip was that it had taken place during the Rugby World Cup, and on this day, Lyon was pretty packed with (Welsh) rugby fans. This 
    was not a fun experience, and I see why James disliked Lille...
    <br><br>
    What I have failed to mention thus far in this account is that throughout this entire trip, Matthew was busy preparing for his PhD. The University of Leeds 
    had provided all sorts of forms to fill out, which I gradually did whilst hopping between cities. In a pleasing twist of fate (see the Oui Oui Trois account 
    when I finally write that), on Oui Oui Une, Matthew was busy arranging his rental contract for Leeds. Whilst in Lyon, it finally went through - all the shenanigans 
    had come to an end! To celebrate, Matthew headed out into the city to get a drink - after all, it was a student city; what could go wrong? It was time to let my hair 
    down...
    <br><br>
    I ended up stumbling through Croix-Paquet and Croix-Rousse for about an hour, slightly lost, having only arrived in the city (alone) a few hours earlier, with almost 
    0 idea of my bearings (and with no phone), and very drunk. Not the best idea, and certainly not the best idea in the morning, when I woke up with a splitting headache. 
    For this reason, I did not get to see as much of Lyon as I would have liked to on this trip, and came away with somewhat of a sour taste in my mouth - mostly 
    self-inflicted, but the Rugby World Cup had certainly not helped. On day 2 I wandered around a little more, returned to the funiculars (man, I loved those funiculars!), 
    went to a nice restaurant (possibly a bouchon?) on my own, then returned to my hostel - I had an early flight to catch the next day! I remember that upon 
    arrival to Part-Dieu, it was pissing it down and I had to walk through all the construction work: it was like the UK was greeting me early! I flew back to London, 
    went via Imperial (to rescue my HPC data), and then returned to Neath, before being whisked up to Leeds only 2 days later. The PhD begins...

    James had a very different experience in Epernay - they went on a champagne tasting tour in this small town in eastern France... on day 2. On the first solo day, 
    their plans were ruined by strikes, so they just explored the town:

its really odd<br>
you go from a working class french village to this lavish bond street avenue that smells like champagne<br>
the street literally reeks of Champagne<br>
it smells rich

There are worse things to reek of

    Day 2 brought a proper Champagne tour: much better. Paris had not exactly sold James on France, but this - this was much better! There could certainly be more 
    Oui Oui adventures if they all looked like this! Their trip took them to Reims and then Strasbourg, where they immediately hopped on a tram to cross the German border 
    (James loves borders!). Also yes, this is yet more foreshadowing, but that will have to wait for another trip... now, it was time for James to return to Paris 
    (yuck) and fly home to Markeyland. Au revoir!

    To correct my mistake in Lyon, I would return 1 year later in a mini bonus adventure I like to call 'Lyon Part-Deux'. I took a train all the way from Carcassonne 
    to Lyon (which was remarkably cheap - 12EUR for 1st class!) and spent an extra night in Lyon to better appreciate the place. This time I returned to the Roman museum 
    during the day and got to see the remarkable artifacts on display. I ended up sitting on the theatre steps for over an hour, reading my book (A Handmaid's Tale: very 
    harrowing). I also went down into Vieux Lyon to a bouchon: not really my cup of tea. I definitely got a better feel for the city this time and learned to like it, 
    especially the public transport. I spent the morning before my flight walking around Parc de la Tête d'Or where I saw my first ever red squirrels! (I am a city boy, 
    what can I say?)
    <br><br>
    I once again headed to the airport to fly home, concluding another France trip, but instead found myself waiting at the airport for hours. And hours. Eventually, after 
    a very long time, EasyJet cancelled the flight. Whilst I do have sympathy for the travel desk staff dealing with an angry crowd, they were neither particularly helpful 
    nor informative. By the time there was any information at all, the last trams had stopped running, so I couldn't even make my own way back to the hostel - I was forced 
    onto the coach (which did a magical mystery tour of Lyon, eventually ending up in Écully Campanile) where we were once again met with a member of staff who handled 
    things very badly - he wouldn't let anyone into their rooms for over an hour. It took until 2:30am for me to finally get into my room. My old trusty Nokia had totally 
    failed me at this point, so it finally met its end in Écully Campanile: I killed it. Rest in Pieces. James was exceptionally pleased.

    In the morning I raced down to Valmy station, caught the metro to Part-Dieu, caught a TGV to Paris, chose the most miserly way of getting to Orly (to save myself a few 
    pence, I switched to a tram), and <i>finally</i> returned to the UK, flying into Manchester airport. Here, the trains shat themselves: good to be back in the UK!
