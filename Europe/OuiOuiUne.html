    <strong>BIENVENUE DANS LA ZONE D'AMNÃ‰SIE!</strong>
    <br><br>
    This 14th adventure on our epic quest marks the start of a new chapter - no, not the chapter where I remember things, or the adventures 
    that I actually wrote up in reasonable time, but the start of the post-Imperial/Oxford adventures. Separated by hundreds of miles, feeling 
    far less spritely than in the past, but armed with passports, we figured that if we wanted to meet up, it was equally easy and expensive to 
    meet on the continent as it was to meet in the UK... wait a minute, that was a fantastic idea!
    <br><br>
    Unfortunately adventures become significantly rarer from this point onwards due to the aforementioned time and cost (doing a poorly-paid PhD 
    is not the best decision if one wishes to optimise these variables), but hopefully they become significantly more exciting! 
    <br><br>
    This adventure is actually a mere excerpt from the 2 grand tours that we were both embarking upon. James will have documented their travel 
    somewhere (probably instagram - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/j_a_arthur_/">follow them there</a>), but Matthew's time remains completely 
    undocumented, so I shall give a very brief rundown of what he was up to, before we move onto the main event - the very few items I recall from 
    our Paris extravaganza: on y va!
