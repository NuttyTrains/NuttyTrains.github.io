	<br><br>
	24th of May, 2022. Crossrail was officially opening, many years late. And NT was... NOT going to be there! Woo! TfL had decided to open this right in the middle of exam 
	season. Matthew had an exam that morning, and James had one the next morning (so did Matthew). Getting to the opening was impossible. Meeting Geoff was impossible. 
	Crossrail - Cross.
	<br><br>
	Exams could not keep James for long though. That Friday, he had his final undergraduate exam (Jesus, where has the time gone? I feel old!), got on the sleeper train and 
	headed straight to London. It was Lizzie line time. Welcome to Koppa 12!
	<br><br>
	James showed up at 6am and was kicked out of his train in PAD. He did some exploring and got himself a shiny new purple Oyster whilst Matthew peeled himself from his bed and 
	fought with the Bakerloo line on his way to PAD, complete with his pseudo-afro (which blew James' previous hair length out of the water), and carrying the day's goods: our

	We headed down into the bowels of the cavernous Paddington Elizabeth line station, seeing the clouds painted onto the glass canopy above, and the huge retaining columns that 
	prevented the station box from collapsing. That was basically all we saw of the station though - as we headed down to the platform, the train was already there and about to 
	leave. Whilst we had every intention of wandering around the station and uncovering its secrets, Matthew's burning urge to <i>not miss the train</i> overrode everything else 
	and we sprinted down the escalator and onto the train as the doors beeped to close. RIP Paddington station. We'll have to come back at some point to correct our oversight.
	<br><br>
	Next up was <s>Bond Street</s>... RIP. Coming soon to Koppa 14/15?
	<br><br>
	Actually next up was Tottenham Court Road. Agoraphobia 101. It was another enormous cavernous station with huge winding white tunnels, and everything comically oversized in 
	comparison to the smaller cramped tube tunnels. Matthew wasn't a fan. Too big. James was in his element though, vlogging his way through the complex, going fully native. 
	<br><br>
	The next station was Farringdon. This station is so large that it connects Barbican and Farringdon tube stations, and you can take a Met train from 1 side to the other. This 
	sounded exactly like the kind of retarded race NT is famed for! After we tried out the inclined lift, we headed straight for the back entrance to the platforms at Barbican, 
	and when the train pulled up, Matthew was off like a rocket. The footage from this race was extremely high kwality, and made an excellent video. 10/10. Matthew filmed roughly 
	15 seconds of cumulative footage, and James managed to only film blurred shots of his feet. Or was that Matthew? Watch NT Lizzie Line 2 for the exciting conclusion to this 
	"thrilling" race!
	<br><br>
	Moral: When setting a race, decide an end point.
	<br><br>
	Farringdon was followed by Liverpool St, another station with an inclined lift that connected 2 adjacent tube stations. It is also another station fitted out with identikit 
	perforated white panels. Whilst there was a clear theme, it wasn't half boring by this point. We decided to essentially give up on this station, which was redeemed only by its 
	beautiful "street" of signage panels, resembling Victorian street lights. Admittedly, that was a good shot. Possibly the best vista on the line.
	<br><br>
	We quickly moved onto Whitechapel and quickly abandoned the Elizabeth line section itself. Who wants to see the Elizabeth line station? What people really want to see is the 
	regular tube and slowverground station, where the overground is under the underground and the underground is over the overground. We spent more time filming the escalators, 
	weird golden entrance archway and distant view of the City than we did filming the actual station. Great success.
	<br><br>
	We moved onto Canary Wharf next. Finally, a station that wasn't identical to all the others! This one resembled the Jubilee line station, covered in steel and concrete. Bonus 
	points for "Crossrail Place" and the canary-yellow escalators. This was quite a pretty station, even though it was enormously complicated and had too many interchanges. We 
	went through Sadiq Khan's new tunnel to promote LSD usage, saw Crossrail Place, and went to the floating botanical gardens atop the station, where we noticed the endangered 
	lesser spotted Crossrail promo poster in its natural habitat - the Indochinese jungle of Mudchute. This video is fantastic, and has everything you could possibly want. Escalator 
	shots, an LSD trip and a David Attenborough documentary all in one! Also some trains, maybe.
	<br><br>
	James wasn't overly keen on all the towers though. They were too tall, especially the tallest:<br>
	<strong>"Look! It is the bank of the Uyghur-genocide-never-happened!"</strong>

	We had been to Custom House before, so spent our 15 minutes there doing a Koppa 10 cosplay. Not that we could compete. It was ComicCon, and our feeble attempt at cosplay was 
	completely outshone by the weebs overcrowding the station. I can guarantee that other people's Crossrail videos didn't have that added excitement! Our Koppa 10 cosplay was 
	further interrupted by a friendly gentleman who complemented James' T-shirt and dropped some interesting news - he was due to give Geoff a tour of TCR where he would reveal 
	the secrets of the station. There were some exclusive titbits that we were told even before Geoff, and decided that this was of the utmost importance - pipping Geoff to the post 
	and getting this scoop first!
	<br><br>
	Before we got ahead of ourselves, we had 2 last stations. Woolwich (not Arsenal), our last new station for the day, was a smaller station, and much darker, broodier and more 
	minimalist than its larger siblings. Far more industrial and Holden-esque, with small splashes of colour to reference the local Royal Dockyards. It wasn't much, but it was honest 
	work. Probably Matthew's favourite of the lot.
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Abbey Wood.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	Last of all was Abbey Wood, the terminus. Matthew took it upon himself to walk every inch of each platform, whilst James took the liberty of trying to fix his new Oyster card and 
	filming the revamped station building, which (unsurpisingly and unimaginitively) was completely wood-panelled. We were just about to leave, when Matthew realised we needed a 
	station photo, causing us to just miss the train. RIP. We instead boarded the next one and headed back to TCR for our scoop.
	<br><br>
	Wow, the Elizabeth Line is quick. We didn't really realise it, getting off at every station, but <i>wow</i>. We were back in TCR in no time, ready to find the black dotted panels 
	to reveal their secrets to our audience. If you want to see the secrets... watch the video! Geoff absolutely didn't release his corrsponding video (complete with scoop) that very 
	same evening!
	<br><br>
	And with that, Koppa 12 was basically over. We made our way from TCR to Kings Cross (via Tesco), and James ran for his train to Leeds. No matter how much time we leave in an adventure, 
	we always end up sprinting. It may have been a short adventure, but it made up for it with the views!

	The original plan after the Elizabeth line had been to see the recently reopened Bank platform, followed by a visit to a Roman Temple in the City. TCR had put an end to those plans, 
	so Matthew went anyway after James left. The Mithraeum was quite cool, but unfortunately, without James, so usable pictures or video was taken. Matthew's photographic skills strike again.
