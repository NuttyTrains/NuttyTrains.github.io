<p>
	Matthew and James went on a 'little' adventure, which ended up lasting 2 days and allowed us to tick off most things from the NT wishlist. The cameras never 
	went away, so watch out 2026 - this video will surprise you!
	<br><br>
	Despite having promised you twice that the Summer of NT was over, after Digamma 2, we thought that we were finally done. Complete. Nothing until Christmas. 
	Big RIP, but oh well, we'd had a good run.
	<br><br>
	But then James told Matthew that he was fed up of living at home in Markeyland, and that before he returned to Cornwall, he was going to come to London for a 
	very short Koppa adventure, and also head to Oxford to give a talk. When I came to start writing this, I realised that the rabbithole of planning this adventure 
	was easily longer than the adventure itself, and this is not a rabbit hole I wish to fall down - it involves planes to Newquay, a quick trip to Aberdeen, and 
	acquiring James a passport. It is the kind of plan you get when you feed Stephen some cwac.
	<br><br>
	With a few days to go, however, we had kind of hammered out a nuts plan. This is what the next train page looked like with about 1 week to go:
	<br><br>
	Welcome to the Koppa IX preparation page, here are the three things we want to do
</p>
<ol>
  <li>DLR Challenge</li>
  <li>Finish the tube</li>
  <li>NLE</li>
  <li>Brompton / Boris Bikes</li>
  <li>DID - OXF</li>
</ol>
<p>
	That's right - we were going to have a second crack at the DLR Challenge, finish* the tube, see the NLE, get a Brompton bike, <i>and</i> go to Oxford. That is 
	easily all possible in a single day, right?
	<br><br>
	TfL even made our lives easier for us by closing part of the DLR and Piccadilly line!... Oh RIP. There goes half our plans.

	James set off at a ¬stupid time for once in his life, and headed to Swansea station with all his worldly possessions. He met Jezza at the station, almost 
	throttled a baby on the train (that was a fun exchange to read back through), heard a GWR conductor speak Welsh, and did some dynamical systems as he travelled 
	via Glozza (Brizzle was still kill), all whilst TweetyBoi was having a spasm, TimeBot was dying, and Matthew was busy meeting Geraint for the first time. Oh, 
	we loves Geraint.
	<br><br>
	Before too long though, James had made his way to PAD, where we finally met up and headed out west on the Lizzie line to Ealing Broadway, back to James' third 
	home: Ealing Premier Inn. This was going to be a fun adventure, dragging his suitcase everywhere!

<p>
	Unlike every previous time he had been in this Premier Inn, this time, he was given a new room on one of the top floors, finally separating him from his usual room. 
	Big Sad. Once James had dumped all his worldly possessions in his room, we made our plans and set off - Genbatte!
	<br><br>
	The first port of call was PAD once more. Not for trains though, this time we were going on two wheels - it was Brompton time! We went to the special Brompton bike 
	locker in Paddington Central, and for 20 long minutes, James fought and fought and fought with the machine. He punched in random codes, and it beeped angrily at him. 
	He made attempt after attempt to connect to the internet, but Bowis said no. He tried his hardest to download the Brompton app, but his phone, adamant that he had 
	not left Cornwall, refused to offer anything but Cornwall download speeds. Once downloaded, the app shoved half a tree's worth of legal documents in his face, and made 
	him sign away his privacy, location, soul and credit card details. But when they wanted to mug him for every last penny he had for the pleasure of a single trip, that 
	was the final straw. Fuck the Brompton bikes, they weren't worth it (renting, that is. Obviously buying one was fine).
	<br><br>
	Instead, it was back to the trains. We took the H&C to King's Cross St Pancras, and changed to the Piccadilly, winding down endless corridors, getting lost, and fighting 
	the occasional minotaur. Nice to see that Scott has found himself a new job.
	<br><br>
	We zoomed straight up the line, all the way to Cockfosters at the end, eventually surfacing near Southgate. The train pulled into Cockfosters, our ante-penultimate tube 
	terminus, whereupon we had our ceremonial picture and set about our latest task: it was Charles Holden time!
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Cockfosters.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	The next 2-ish hours were dominated by James being a full-on anorak. Matthew had never seen anything like it. What monster had he created? Whilst he was perfectly content 
	to sit in the station garden (which was very nice), James was filming anything that moved (and plenty that didn't), including all the trains, the magnificent station roof, 
	the wide concourse, the 2 main entrances, the ex-ticket offices, the new step-free lift, and all the passengers who came too close to him. We surfaced, had a brief walk 
	over to the start of the GREEN, filmed some shit in the lift, and Matthew ran off with the camera. All in a day's work really. Cockfosters was our joint-favourite station 
	on this end section of line, but before long we were back on the train to our next stop: Oakwood.
	<br><br>
	Oakwood station also didn't disappoint, and unlike Oakwood in Pembrokeshire, no-one died here. On the station list, we called this, our third-favourite station, "Box", and 
	that sums it up pretty well - it was a box. No questions asked. We saw the cool roundel/lamppost in the car park, and moved onto the crown jewel... 
	<br><br>
	Southgate, also a joint-favourite, did not disappoint. It was magnificent. The flying-saucer shaped station was everything Matthew had promised, and more. It is easy to 
	see why this is often called the best station on the tube. It was a shame that we couldn't get any cool long-exposure shots at night, but hopefully our long-exposure 
	day shots and shitty clips make up for it. We even had a meal deal try to follow us onto the road here!
	<br><br>
	Finally, we reached Arnos Grove and Bounds Green, cyclindrically- and octagonally-shaped respectively. These were also cool Charles Holden stations, but they were our 
	least favourite of the 5 (not that that is harsh criticism). We finished off our segment here by filming some segment at the top of a random bridge, after we both had 
	the same idea at the same time (which turned out to be a rubbish shot). Illi Vitae. It was now time to head south and try and do some other shit before the sun set. Genbatte! 
	<br><br>
	We threw some ideas back and forth, but eventually Matthew decided to ignore all input from James and just execute the first plan that came into his head without giving 
	James any warning about when or where we were changing trains. We changed twice in rapid succession at Finsbury Park and Highbury & Islington, and eventually found our 
	way onto the slowverground. That's right folks, we might be almost finished with the tube, but we have plenty more slowverground to cover!
	<br><br>
	Stop moaning, delicious content is delicious content!
	<br><br>
	We waited for ages at Highbury & Islington for our correct train after we missed the first by a few seconds (the second decided to be especially slow just to rub salt 
	into an open wound), before finally heading down the East London Line into Art Student HQ. James might think he has it bad in Falmouth, but one look at Shoreditch, even  
	at a social distance up upon a viaduct, left scarred him mentally for life. That was <i>bad</i>, and he vowed never to go there again!
	<br><br>
	<strong>Coming soon on Koppa 11: "Matthew, let's go to Shoreditch so that I can be with my queer friends; the art students! How bad can they be?"</strong>

<p>
	We also passed through Whitechapel on this line, but unfortunately saw no purp evidence :( Whitechapel is the only location in London where the underground passes over 
	the overground and the overground passes under the underground. This fried James' dyspraxic brain and he wanted to leave.
	<br><br>
	At Canada Water, Matthew handed over control of the adventure to James' stomach, which was now on a 15-minute countdown to genocidal fury, the kind of anger felt only 
	by a drunk, high "inhabitant" of Townhill when Markey tried to fob them off by replacing their daily cwac benefits with weed benefits. You saw what they did when they 
	burned those cars for a laugh! James' stomach was about to do the same unless we found food NOW!
	<br><br>
	We headed to London Bridge and then walked towards the river, past the Shard and Tower Bridge, down through some Victorian warehouses, and into Pizza Express. James 
	spent the entire walk snapping photos of the Shard from all kinds of angles, before turning around and saying that he didn't understand the point of skyscrapers, and 
	that they should knock them all down, and replace them with a library, some fields, some fishing boats and a Bargain Booze, just like they have down Camborne. Before 
	promptly turning around and snapping some more pictures.
	<br><br>
	<strong>"I don't get the point of Tower Bridge. It is just a bridge" - James, K9, after killing his camera battery with endless Tower Bridge shots on K8</strong>
	<br><br>
	This Pizza Express was quite nice actually. Would recommend. The mini camera spent the entire time spasming for our entertainment too. We considered continuing on 
	that night, but in a first for NT, we decided to call it a night and mop up the NLE the next morning. James had other plans for that night... 
	<br><br>
	We caught a train to Charing Cross, being some of the only people left on the train after it passed Waterloo East, and added another London terminus to our growing 
	collection. We passed the very centre of London (Charing Cross) and walked for about 5 minutes to Covent Garden, where we split ways, and James met up with Molly for 
	what would be a very fun night... 
	<br><br>
	James spent his evening getting blind drunk when seeing Molly, got his bag searched in a club, and got touched up by a woman. All in a day's work really.

<p>
	We then reconvened on Day 2, meeting in Paddington yet again. James was late, and Matthew was even later (but you expected that, didn't you?). We met at about 10:45, 
	and immediately set off for the day of the Northern Line Extension!
	<br><br>
	We started by mopping up the rest of the H&C, from PAD to Hammersmith, ticking off the 8th tube line of the 11. We are good at this tube lark, aren't we? As this was 
	a terminus, we had our photo here, to James' slight confusion. We then left the station, walked across the roundabout, into the shopping centre, and back into Hammersmith 
	tube, which did nothing to help his confusion.
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Hammersmith.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	The plan at Hammersmith had been easy - get to Earl's Court, then West Brompton. It didn't matter how we did it. But then 2 trains turned up simultaneously, 1 Picc 
	and 1 District, both going to Earl's Court. You know what that meant? It was time for a drop-of-the-hat race! Matthew ran onto the District train, and James onto 
	the Picc, and in no time at all, the doors closed, and we were off! Matthew had a slight advantage in terms of acceleration, top speed and flat gradient, but James' 
	train would be skipping 1 stop, giving <i>him</i> and advantage! For the first time, this looked like it would be an even match! The doors on our trains opened at 
	exactly the same time, right in front of one another, at Baron's Court, after which James descended into the abyss and into a straight run to the destination. It was 
	going to be very tight! Find out the winner in 2024 when this special mini-video goes live! Picc vs District, Matthew vs James, exclusively on the NT YouTube channel!
	<br><br>
	Nah, just kidding, Matthew won on account of James getting lost in the underground passages at Earl's Court.
	<br><br>
	We headed to West Brompton, then took a rare Southern train to Clapham Junction. By now it was miserable and raining, so when we then ticked off Queenstown Road we got 
	absolutely soaked, and James managed to get splashed by a passing train. Maybe that is what the anorak is for?
	<br><br>
	Here, we were closing in on our goal. The walk from Queenstown Road passed the elusive Battersea Park station, as well as Battersea Dogs and Cats Home (we love you Larry!), 
	but nothing could compare to what we had come for: Battersea Power Station Station Station Station Station.
	<br><br> 
	Battersea Power Station Station Station did not disappoint. James loved it. We must have spent over half an hour just sitting in the square outside the station, trying 
	to recreate Geoff's (and Matthew's) NLE opening shots in exquisite detail, as well as film the best, most-meta NT intro ever. Hopefully some day the video for this 
	will be uploaded, byte by byte, to Youtube, and then you will be able to see the station in HD for the first time (unlike on the Aleph 23 video).

<p>
	We headed down the escalators to the huge station concourse, and admired the coloured panels artwork that adorned the sides (and also got told that filming was not allowed 
	- what bullshit. We ignored her). We headed down to the platform, which James greatly approved of, even if the clean under-rail area still disturbed Matthew. Matthew 
	showed James all the places that Geoff had filmed, and all the shots he had taken, which came very much in handy for when James went full Geoff for the Okehampton opening 
	a few weeks later.
	<br><br>
	Eventually the train arrived, and we continued to Nine Elms, where we repeated the exact same steps, filming everything and recreating all the Geoff shots. Matthew revised 
	his opinion of Nine Elms, having been to all the Holden stations the previous day - it is quite nice actually.
	<br><br>
	After a quick detour to the US Embassy, where Joe ordered a drone strike on James for bringing his camera too close, and a second detour to yet another weird Sainsbury's, 
	we got back on the tube and headed to Kennington. We got slightly lost at Kennington, but eventually went in the right direction and walked to Elephant and Castle (what 
	a dump!). We caught the first Thameslink train that arrived, and headed to Blackfriars, the glorious glass station suspended across the Thames, which is very cool indeed. 
	We must have walked up and down the station at least 5 times, trying to see everything. It was very cool.
	<br><br>
	We then left the station, and walked up towards Holborn Viaduct, attempting to tick off one more objective on this adventure: City Thameslink. We had ironically caught the 
	night bus from City Thameslink more times than I can remember, but we had never actually been inside. That was going to change today!
	<br><br>
	...except it wasn't. Despite trying to break in through all the different entrances, it turns out that City Thameslink is closed on Sundays. RIP. We'll get you on KX, 
	City Thameslink! Mark my words!
	<br><br>
	We saw some meal deals, returned to Blackfriars, and caught Thameslink once more. We passed through City Thameslink slowly, not stopping, playing sad violin music the 
	whole time. We ticked off Farrington, and arrived in St Pancras, our favourite terminus.
	<br><br>
	Now this should have been the end, as we wandered around looking for a suitable closing shot. We considered ending by the John Betjeman statue (the author of the poem 
	Slough - see below), but then we saw it: The Eurostar - the train that goes to France. Having both been well-educated in the ways of Only Fools and Horses, this gave 
	us the perfect idea. Off we set, popping in and out of every corner shop for a mile, until we found it: a croissant. We hurried back to the train, and filmed the best 
	ending ever!
	<br><br>
	<strong>Let's go and make fun of the French!<br>
	Bonjour! NOM!</strong>

<p>
	And so ended Koppa 9. Matthew probably fucked off to the MLC, but James had a far more interesting idea: James had a dodgy plan to get himself to Oxford. He picked up 
	his worldly belongings in Ealing, but instead of returning to PAD, he just boarded the train at Ealing! We rode the shitty GWR sprinter-replacement train [not a pacer :(] 
	down the line, stopping at most stations. Unfortunately, TweetyBoi had hijacked the announcement equipment on the train, and was announcing that the train would be stopping 
	at <i>every</i> station - West Ealing, Hanwell, Southall - the lot of them! Instead, the train just whizzed through. James was loving it. This was exactly the end he had 
	signed up for. Where would the train stop? Nobody knew!
	<br><br>
	The train did stop at Slough though. Please enjoy this fine excerpt from the Nutty Trains poetry compilation, maybe available on Audible:

	He eventually made it to Oxford, had a few gallons to drink, had a breakdown, gave a talk on Mobius strips, and returned home to CAMBORNE! (Luckily not on a Wednesday)
