	Matthew and James went on a 'little' adventure, which ended up lasting 2 days and allowed us to tick off most things from the NT wishlist. The cameras never 
	went away, so watch out 2026 - this video will surprise you!
	<br><br>
	Well this was fun - we met in PAD and headed to Ealing Premier Inn (where James had a new room), then 
	tried and failed to get a Brompton Bike for James, so fucked off to Cockfosters instead. James went full anorak as we filmed the Charles 
	Holden stations at the end of the line; Cockfosters, Oakwood, Southgate, Arnos Grove and Bounds Green. We then headed south, via the East London line, to 
	Whitechapel and Canada Water, before walking from London Bridge, past the Shard and Tower Bridge, to Pizza Express. We caught a train to Charing Cross, then 
	walked to Covent Garden, so that James could get drunk when seeing Molly, get his bag searched in a club, and get touched up by a woman. All in a day's work.
	<br><br>
	We then reconvened on Day 2, meeting in Paddington and mopping up the rest of the H&C, before racing each other from Hammersmith to Earl's Court (separate 
	video coming soon), taking a Southern train to Clapham Junction, and ticking off Queenstown Road, before heading to Battersea Power Station Station Station. 
	Recreated all the shots, before doing the same at Nine Elms. Walked from Kennington to Elephant and Castle (what a dump) and caught Thameslink to Blackfriars. 
	Saw Holborn Viaduct and failed to tick off City Thameslink, before going out of our way to make fun of the French in St Pancras by buying a croissant and 
	standing in front of the Eurostar. Finally, James had a dodgy plan to get himself to Oxford.
