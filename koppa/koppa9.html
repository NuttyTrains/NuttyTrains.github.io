	Matthew and James went on a 'little' adventure, which ended up lasting 2 days and allowed us to tick off most things from the NT wishlist. The cameras never 
	went away, so watch out 2026 - this video will surprise you!
	<br><br>
	Despite having promised you twice that the Summer of NT was over, after Digamma 2, we thought that we were finally done. Complete. Nothing until Christmas. 
	Big RIP, but oh well, we'd had a good run.
	<br><br>
	But then James told Matthew that he was fed up of living at home in Markeyland, and that before he returned to Cornwall, he was going to come to London for a 
	very short Koppa adventure, and also head to Oxford to give a talk. When I came to start writing this, I realised that the rabbithole of planning this adventure 
	was easily longer than the adventure itself, and this is not a rabbit hole I wish to fall down - it involves planes to Newquay, a quick trip to Aberdeen, and 
	acquiring James a passport. It is the kind of plan you get when you feed Stephen some cwac.
	<br><br>
	With a few days to go, however, we had kind of hammered out a nuts plan. This is what the next train page looked like with about 1 week to go:
	<br><br>
	Welcome to the Koppa IX preparation page, here are the three things we want to do
</p>
<ol>
  <li>DLR Challenge</li>
  <li>Finish the tube</li>
  <li>NLE</li>
  <li>Brompton / Boris Bikes</li>
  <li>DID - OXF</li>
</ol>
<p>
	That's right - we were going to have a second crack at the DLR Challenge, finish* the tube, see the NLE, get a Brompton bike, <i>and</i> go to Oxford. That is 
	easily all possible in a single day, right?
	<br><br>
	TfL even made our lives easier for us by closing part of the DLR and Piccadilly line!... Oh RIP. There goes half our plans.

	James set off at a ¬stupid time for once in his life, and headed to Swansea station with all his worldly possessions. He met Jezza at the station, almost 
	throttled a baby on the train (that was a fun exchange to read back through), heard a GWR conductor speak Welsh, and did some dynamical systems as he travelled 
	via Glozza (Brizzle was still kill), all whilst TweetyBoi was having a spasm, TimeBot was dying, and Matthew was busy meeting Geraint for the first time. Oh, 
	we loves Geraint.
	<br><br>
	Before too long though, James had made his way to PAD, where we finally met up and headed out west on the Lizzie line to Ealing Broadway, back to James' third 
	home: Ealing Premier Inn. This was going to be a fun adventure, dragging his suitcase everywhere!

	We met in PAD and headed to Ealing Premier Inn (where James had a new room), then 
	tried and failed to get a Brompton Bike for James, so fucked off to Cockfosters instead. James went full anorak as we filmed the Charles 
	Holden stations at the end of the line; Cockfosters, Oakwood, Southgate, Arnos Grove and Bounds Green. We then headed south, via the East London line, to 
	Whitechapel and Canada Water, before walking from London Bridge, past the Shard and Tower Bridge, to Pizza Express. We caught a train to Charing Cross, then 
	walked to Covent Garden, so that James could get drunk when seeing Molly, get his bag searched in a club, and get touched up by a woman. All in a day's work.
	<br><br>
	We then reconvened on Day 2, meeting in Paddington and mopping up the rest of the H&C, before racing each other from Hammersmith to Earl's Court (separate 
	video coming soon), taking a Southern train to Clapham Junction, and ticking off Queenstown Road, before heading to Battersea Power Station Station Station. 
	Recreated all the shots, before doing the same at Nine Elms. Walked from Kennington to Elephant and Castle (what a dump) and caught Thameslink to Blackfriars. 
	Saw Holborn Viaduct and failed to tick off City Thameslink, before going out of our way to make fun of the French in St Pancras by buying a croissant and 
	standing in front of the Eurostar. Finally, James had a dodgy plan to get himself to Oxford.
