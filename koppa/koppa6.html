    The tube was kill, the Overloo was kill, our plans were kill and Matthew and James were kill after hauling James' stuff across London, so we tried out 
    the old codger lifestyle, and life was good.

    James unpacked all his stuff from his room in Teddy Hall, and headed to Oxford station for the last time, before catching the train to London. 
    <br><br>
    Matthew then met James in a very busy PAD (stupidly busy for a Sunday), then we took his stuff on the killed tube to Matthew’s new house at Kensal Green. He 
    unloaded his stuff, and we headed out to look for some lunch. We tried the first pub, but they didn't do Sunday Lunch, so that was unacceptable. The second pub 
    was too pricey - up to £68! But finally, the good old King William IV offered a well-priced roast dinner, which was acceptable to James (just not to Matthew, who 
    bought himself a Tesco Meal Deal like a miser).

    After lunch, once we were full, we then jumped on the slowverground going north, right to the edge of the South (according to a Londoner - true Cornishmen know 
    that the North starts at the Tamar, Ooh Arrgh!), to try and tick off that line.
    <br><br>
    We ticked off all the NR stations on the Bakerloo, then left the Bakerloo territory - and immediately were greeted by a run of beautiful stations. Correlation? I 
    think so! Honestly, the Bakerloo is shit, I hate it, it can go die in a hole and it will be the death of me. The moment we abandoned it, everything looked so much 
    better. As much as I complain about the slowverground, the Bakerloo is even worse. Hence, that combined section of the line shall henceforth be known as the 
    <strong>'Overloo'</strong>. Amen. 
    <br><br>
    We went all the way up into Watford, to Watford Junction, but to avoid the ludicrous fare at that station (all to line Richard Branson's pocket), we had 
    our photo (whilst James had a stroke), explored the enormous 11-platform station, and immediately turned back.
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Watford Junction.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
    But not for long! At Watford High Street, we disembarked and headed out into the unknown - ¬London! James demonstrated the repulsivity of the dreaded North, and 
    Matthew had to save him by pulling him back into the South, before he caught Gravy-19!
    <br><br>
    Now initially, James was absolutely convinced that this was London, and he would hear nothing else. But that soon began to change. Firstly we saw some Arriva blue 
    buses... which were genuine, bona fide Arriva Buses! Ave Arriva! You never lost the license to our hearts! We then walked into the town centre: after we saw the 
    fountains, James said it reminded him of Swansea, and after he saw the old Tudor pub, he said it reminded him more of a typical English city. There were typical 
    English houses too. There was even a typical English bus service, so we filmed "A cornishman's guide to English buses for Londoners" video, to help out any poor 
    lost Londoners who might wander up here accidentally.
    <br><br>
    But then we reached the park, and that changed everything. We were greeted by a beautiful and serene park, filled with oak trees, and with a brass band playing jazz 
    in the band stand, surrounded by a clapping audience and couples dancing. There was a cafe selling cheap tea (the Cha Cafe), and even a croquet lawn! We were no longer 
    in London - this was now the Home Counties, and we both felt very much at ease there - too much at ease - what is happening to NT if we keep going to nice places like 
    this? We need to go back to some shithole and get stabbed to even this out!
    <br><br>
    But seriously, it was very nice. 10/10 would go again. You can hear all about this on the NT podcast - coming (just below this sentence) soon-ish!

        "Jubilee is a purple word!"
    </strong>
    <br><br>
    We then walked to the Met tube station, past the grammar school, and waited 15 minutes for the train, before hopping back on for more NT mayhem. Cue more random clips 
    and jumping on and off (we nearly got abandoned more than once - this one was tight!)
    <br><br>
    Eventually, we rocked up in Harrow-on-the-Hill, which has a strange tube roundel (and that is your one accurate tube fact for this account - the rest shall be delivered 
    on video by James. Hear them and weep!)
    <br><br>
    We had just missed the Uxbridge train, but walked over to the platform anyway, admiring the Chiltern services at the station and plotting a future trip at the same time. 
    It was at this point that we realised that we had little time left - it was half 4 already, and we had an awkward route back. Hence, we decided to abandon both our goal 
    of reaching Uxbridge, the Gilfach Fargoed of Koppa, and our goal of hiring a Brompton bike for James. Big Sad.
    <br><br>
    Instead, the rest of the journey was masterplanned by Matthew, all in his head. Let's talk through it as it happened:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stage 1: Get on the next Uxbridge train. The subsequent steps could be planned whilst jumping on and off. James was told this bit of the plan, but nothing else.</li>
  <li>Stage 2a: Get James to search Uxbridge for a Pizza Express. No dice - it was closed. Bugger. That's Uxbridge ruled out. </li>
  <li>Stage 2b: James tells Matthew that there is a Pizza Express in Ruislip. This is an interesting proposal, but still only leaves us with 40 minutes to eat. Hmm. </li>
  <li>Stage 2c: Get James to search Ealing for a Pizza Express. Bingo! There was one. Quickly formulating a plan, Matthew calculated there would be ample time to 
      change at Rayners Lane to the Piccadilly, tick off everything to North Ealing (see Koppa 4), walk to Ealing, get food, take the Lizzie line to PAD, then the Bakerloo 
      to Kensal Green, from where the plan could proceed to St Pancras in the evening. Perfect! Only one snag - was the Lizzie line kill?
  </li>
  <li>Stage 2d: Ask James to check the Lizzie line. Fuck. It was kill. Reformulating plan...</li>
  <li>Stage 3: No time! We were in Rayners Lane! Jump off the train and shout for James to follow. James was very confused. Check the dot matrix on the other platform 
      for inspiration - the was no Picc train for 15 mins. Grr, fine - we'd try Harrow instead.
  </li>
  <li>Stage 4: SCRATCH THAT, LOOK WHO WAS APPROACHING THE PLATFORM! A PICC! SCREW EVERYTHING, WE WERE GOING TO EALING!</li>
  <li>Stage 5a: RUN!</li>
  <li>Stage 5b: Tap purple tappy-tap</li>
  <li>Stage 5c: Jump on train with James. James? James? Oh. Oh no. He was still at the tappy-tap, just standing there aimlessly. Oh no. Oh God no. The doors were beeping. 
      He didn't even have his Oyster yet. Fuck! Quick, jump off!
  </li>
  <li>Stage 6: I guess it is back to Harrow then!</li>
  <li>Stage 7: Get on the Met and skulk back the 2 stops to Harrow-on-the-Hill, to go to Pizza Express there. NT-0, Uxbridge-2. RIP.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    With that debaucle over, we arrived back in Harrow once again, and quickly arrived in Pizza Express, in the middle of the prettiest shopping centre we had ever seen. It 
    was easily a 10/10. You know what was even quicker though? Our pizzas. We had been there barely 10 minutes before they arrived at our table, and James then spent the 
    next 20 minutes shoving his burning hot Calabrese down his throat, stripping it raw yet again. Yummy.

    Pleased that we had made up time, we decided to kill time by ordering tea. Oh what a mistake that was. The tea was lovely and well-needed, but by the time we had paid 
    the bill, half an hour had disappeared, and we were back to powerwalking. We made it back to Harrow-on-the-Hill yet again, filmed a 'very accurate' introduction to 
    our next segment of the journey, then went one stop south to Northwick Park.
    <br><br>
    At Northwick Park, we then attempted TfL's "12 minute walk" to Kenton. See our attempt at that below:
    <br><br>
    Needless to say, TfL are full of shit.
    <br><br>
    James topped up his Oyster and we headed to the platform to find that the Overloo was kill. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuckety-fuck. What were we going to do?
    <br><br>
    Eventually, however, it finally showed up, and we were soon back in Kensal Green, slightly ahead of schedule.

    We returned to Matthew's house, and James packed up all his stuff, ready for the final and hardest leg of the journey - carrying 2 bags, a suitcase and a bike all 
    the way back to St Pancras. In half an hour.
    <br><br>
    In theory, this was entirely fine, and were it not for one tiny mishap, we would have made it. But reality is a cruel mistress (how Matthew likes it), and that one 
    tiny mishap <i>did</i> happen. That mishap was the slowverground. It decided to just not show up for 12 minutes, and then took its bleddy time getting into Euston. 
    Matthew had tried jumping on and off to complete the line, but James was too kill to join in, so we gave up. 
    <br><br>
    We arrived in Euston with about 5 mins to go, and immediately started following the green arrows to St Pancras. They directed us down a backstreet... then stopped. 
    Entirely. Leaving us stranded. We had no idea where we were going. Fuck. We had missed it. All that destruction wrought on poor Matthew's arms was for naught. James 
    looked up later services, and decided on one a few minutes later, leaving from King's Cross. So therefore, we continued our trek to St Pancras.
    <br><br>
    St Pancras can be described in one word: magnificent. As much as we love Paddington, NT simply cannot award the title of 'prettiest London terminus' to anything 
    but St Pancras. It makes even neighbouring Kings Cross look a bit shit, thanks to its beautiful clock tower. But as we entered Kings Cross, we noticed one thing 
    that St Pancras did not have. This:
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/King's Cross.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
    We and a group of 2 exchanged phones to take pictures of one another in front of the sign (this has to be the only place where other people engage in this time-hallowed 
    NT tradition), and then we sat down to wait for the train. We then walked the whole length of the train to the end, and James boarded, waving Matthew goodbye as he 
    headed to Cambridge.
    <br><br>
    Thanks to the stupid slowverground and James' lightning-quick direct train, James actually arrived at his new home before Matthew did. Oh, the irony. And thus ended Koppa 6. 
    Ave Arriva.
