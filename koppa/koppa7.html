	It was time for Matthew to face all his fears, because Cambridge hadn't been enough. We were going on an RRB *shudders*. We were going on a tram *fear*. We were 
	going to Croydon *faints*. NT was going saaaaaaf. #IKEAmeansIKEA
	<br><br>
	You know what the best way to start an NT adventure is? Completely and utterly shattered! And after an extremely long day before, we were definitely both tired 
	out of our minds.
	<br><br>
	James woke up ludicrously early to do some last minute birthday shopping in Cambridge. Matthew slept.<br>
	James went all the way across Cambridge to give REDACTED a piece of his mind. Matthew frustratedly set his alarm clock to snooze for the nth time.<br>
	James boarded the 10:22 train at Cambridge station, having lugged his suitcase all the way across town. Matthew finally started to unpeel himself from bed.<br>
	Koppa 7 was go... in 5 more minutes.

	By about 11, James had made it to Kings Cross, but Matthew was still not functioning after his near-death ride the previous night, so he was only just ready to 
	leave Kensal. James thus set himself up in Kings Cross to do some long-overdue work. James was in no way screwed. No way. :)
	<br><br>
	But as Matthew was to soon find out, if James wasn't screwed, then he was doing absolutely amazingly! He rocked up at Kensal Green, expecting a short hop to Euston, 
	only to find that the Overloo was completely out of action. So was the Bakerloo until Queens Park. So was the NLL at Kensal Rise. Fuck, fuck, fuck. This was going 
	to make even our Thameslink trouble from the previous day look like a walk in the park. So whilst walking to Queens Park to pick up the non-kill bit of the Bakerloo, 
	Matthew checked his phone, and found that the Piccadilly had been severely delayed that morning, and the Circle just straight up hadn't been running. He rang James, 
	and James said that the H&C was severely fucked, the Central was severely fucked, yet more of the Slowverground was kill, the W&C was kill, and almost every other line 
	was suffering either from staff shortages, part closures, severe delays or minor delays. What cursed storm had James brought about upon the tube this time? If this 
	carries on, I swear to God that there'll be a full tube strike by Koppa 10. Mark my words!
	<br><br>
	So after moaning that he would refuse to take the bus, Matthew finally reached Queens Park and headed into London, changing at Baker Street, praying that <i>something</i> 
	would be working. He arrived at the platform to find... HELD. The train was held in the tunnel. Just his luck.
	<br><br>
	After a few minutes, the train showed its sorry face, and Matthew squeezed onto the one operational H&C train that day, and headed to the labyrinthine Kings Cross St 
	Pancras, eventually finding James in Kings Cross, eating his lunch and doing some maths. After a birthday call to Freya, it was time to repeat that whole ordeal in 
	reverse... with heavy luggage. Matthew was going to commit the not alive.

<p>
	After struggling through the station, we headed for the Victoria line. Many, many miles of tunnel later, we reached the platform and got on, changing at Oxford Circus 
	to the Bakerloo, all the way up to Queens Park. And then the fun began.
	<br><br>
	See, beyond that point was Rail Replacement Buses only. Which meant taking a bus, much to Matthew's disgust and horror, and James' delight. Throughout the entire 
	twisted, convoluted journey, Matthew's face bore a look of contorted fear and displeasure. Matthew doesn't like busses. Can you tell?
	<br><br>
	The bus stopped at Kensal Green station, having passed Matthew's house, and we lugged everything back towards the house. Then out of nowhere, the wheel on James' 
	suitcase decided that now was the time to die and make everything miserable for Matthew and James. The rubber split clean open right down the middle of the wheel, 
	exposing the plastic to the concrete pavement, allowing the fabric seam to get shredded by the road, and jamming up the wheel with flaks of shredded rubber, acting 
	as a very efficient brake pad. Carrying that suitcase was distilled pain and suffering.
	<br><br>
	Eventually we got back inside to find that the wheel was now triangular thanks to having been used by the concrete like a rubber on paper. Thus, the next hour was 
	dedicated to sorting out all of James' stuff as best as possible.
	<br><br>
	Before long, it was 3pm, which would be fine on a normal day, but perhaps less so on a Sunday, especially a Sunday where the tube was so dead that there was more life 
	in Kensal Green Cemetery. Assessing our options, we quickly set off, walking to Queens Park station.
	<br><br>
	We jumped on the train waiting at the station, through doors near the exits at Paddington, and were soon on our way. When we reached Paddington, we walked at light 
	speed off the platform (first out!) then literally ran up the escalator towards the District line.
	<br><br>
	At this point, James was rather confused. He had just seen our train pull in, yet Matthew was not running! What had happened to him? Little did he know that Matthew 
	had not seen the train - it had been blocked by the train on the near platform 1 second earlier, so he was blissfully unaware of his fate. After a mere few seconds 
	though, Matthew heard a second pair of brakes screeching, realised immediately what had happened, and started legging it again, up some stairs, across the bridge, 
	down some stairs, through the crowd and onto the train, much to James' legs' dismay. We made it just in time and were off!
	<br><br>
	We changed at HSK for a District train, 6 minutes away, and took this time to explore the lesser used side of the station. I don't even know if trains even use Platform 
	4 anymore. @geofftech, can you enlighten me?
	<br><br>
	We then boarded our Wimbledon train, avoided the drunk homeless man shouting and screaming whilst sleeping on the front seats of the train, and began to head saaaaaaf. 
	Matthew shuddered. This was going to be tough. Out of pure stress, James' camera ate an SD card worth of footage. Again.

	It was fine initially. We passed through lovely Kensington, Fulham and Putney, jumping on and off (and getting a <i>fantastic</i> Thames shot as we crossed 
	the bridge). Before long, we were approaching Wimbledon, henceforth known as Wombledon.
	<br><br>
	<strong>"I like trains - it's an autism thing"</strong>
	<br><br>
	Matthew had a moment of confusion at Wombledon thanks to the very strange ticketing system at that station, but eventually we made our way down to Platform 10. It was 
	tram time!
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Wimbledon.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	We boarded the tram, and realised immediately what we had gotten ourselves into. This was merely a bus on rails, and not in the god-like ways of the Pacer (Resquiscat in 
	Pace, Pacers). This felt <i>wrong</i> to Matthew. He was in deep, deep pain - saaaf of the river, and on a glorified bus. As soon as we had pulled out of the station, it 
	merely worsened. The lovely surroundings of Wombledon gave way to classic miserable South London, and the tram revealed itself to be even more bus-like than Matthew had 
	feared. It started pulling to a halt only 60 seconds after leaving Wombledon, arriving at what was clearly a bus stop, complete with crappy shelter, but with ideas 
	far, far above its station (see what I did there?). It was disgraceful - an insult to the tube map. Should be shot.
	<br><br>
	We then exited to film the first stop, Dundonald Road, but whilst staying too close to the doors on the way back in, we managed to repeatedly trigger the doors to reopen, 
	time and time again. Matthew, afraid that the 'bus' was going to take its anger out on him, the poor out-of-place train lover, sat down and refused to have anything more 
	to do with this abomination, and said that James could do all the running from now on.
	<br><br>
	And you'd better believe that there was a lot of running. The tram stopped at glorified bus shelters with miserable excuses for platforms every 60 seconds, or sometimes 
	even more frequently than that. Throughout this entire journey, Matthew had a pained look on his face, and had eyes more dead than the Overloo line. James on the other 
	hand was in his element. A bus? A train? Some knot theory? This was all his favourite things, all in one! This was the best thing ever! He loved it so much that he stated 
	with nothing less than certainty, "I may have to live in Croydon, I love this so much!".

<p>
	Before long, we arrived at the electrifyingly-named Ampere Way, right next to the IKEA car park, had a photo, and headed straight in. We walked through the doors at 16:27, 
	33 minutes before closing. This was going to be a quick one.
	<br><br>
	First things first, we had to get the important bit out of the way - food. The restaurant was closing in 3 minutes, so we ran up the escalator, down the corridor (passing 
	IKEA's vaporwave display - IKEA, what are ew doin?), and joined the queue with just seconds to spare.
	<br><br>
	<i>And now for an excerpt from the NT Michelin Guide - coming maybe, possibly, probably not soon:</i><br>
	IKEA Croydon: Classic Ikea restaurant. Very poor range on offer. You'd think we'd turned up 3 minutes before closing. Pah! Disgraceful! Rude chefs. Didn't like them. 
	Nice meatballs meal. The tea and coffee machine was out of service - no way to run a restaurant! When it was finally restored to working order, some child with cholera 
	came and wiped his chocky fingers all over the nozzle repeatedly, rendering it unusable. Child should have been shot. The highlight was the Daim cake, which was 
	absolutely beautiful. Will have again. In all, not bad - maybe a 6/10.
	<br><br>
	With a mere 11 minutes to go before closing time, we then set out to conduct an IKEA trip at world record speed, and make it through the whole shop before we got locked 
	in. We started powerwalking/jogging/flat out sprinting the whole way through, putting Matthew's plotting and weaving skills to the maximum as he dodged display after 
	display after slow person. We each picked out the customary piece of random crap on the way out (James won though - his broken clock tower beat Matthew's scrubby thing) 
	and headed for the exit. In all, traversing the entire Markethall had taken a mere 4 minutes 37 seconds - perhaps we were going to make it after all!
	<br><br>
	And then we turned the corner. Oh fuck. We were not making it. Stretching out before us was the world's longest queue. Even the short no-trolleys queue was extremely 
	long, but eventually we staggered to the checkout, negotiated the 10,000 option screens, paid, and left. That IKEA wasn't closing until 7pm at the earliest. RIP.
	<br><br>
	<strong>"I almost shat myself"<br>
	"What, from the woman in the headscarf?"<br>
	"If I shat myself over that, I'd be dead here in London"<br>
	"What, from shitting yourself or from boomy-boomy?"<br>
	"Both!"</strong>
	<br><br>
	The sensible thing to do here would have been to head home, but instead, we decided to make our lives even worse and head into Croydon. This was going to be a mistake. 
	<br><br>
	We crammed into the front doors of the tram as the entire queue of IKEA customers trooped into the tiny cramped tram after us, and James still somehow managed to jump on 
	and off through the hordes of South Londoners, whilst Matthew started snooping on the driver's controls.
	<br><br>
	We shortly arrived in Croydon proper, and were promptly off the rails and onto the roads, weaving in and out of cars, paying no respect to existing lanes, and even 
	undercutting and fucking over buses. This was so cool that even Matthew started to warm to the trams. It was bloody brilliant!
	<br><br>
	We looped around Croydon town centre, alighting at East Croydon, as we went off to film some "BBC" clips for James' "Documentary". When he finally gets around to 
	creating this "documentary", the results will be below: Watch it. We need the views.
	<br><br>
	At this point, a man came up to us and started asking what we were doing with the cameras. James then waffled for 15 whole minutes about his life story, the intricacies 
	of knot theory, his mathematical career, and his time in film school, and how he worked for the BBC and was filming a documentary on "The hidden knot theory of Croydon 
	Tramlink". Matthew was deeply, deeply impressed by this waffling. To then add insult to injury after James had fully duped this man, when we actually filmed this clip, 
	we spoke about utter shit involving Dick Whittington's hidden connection to the trams.
	<br><br>
	<strong>"Take care James and Matthew!"</strong> - George, East Croydon, 2021. Watch our videos.
	<br><br>
	We then boarded the westbound tram, wound our way straight down the High Street, ticked off the stations by Poundland (Tick!), and hopped our way back towards Wimbledon, 
	despite the trams being lazy swines and fucking off to the depot.
	<br><br>
	<strong>"I like a bit of eye candy"<br>
	"So in short, it is only your down below that is asexual - your eyes certainly aren't!"</strong>
	<br><br>
	We then disembarked at Morden Lane, and watched a guy faceplant the dirt path for entertainment, before receiving yet more entertainment as James recounted his tale 
	of REDACTED from the previous night. It was fucking funny. If only that had been on camera. It would have been golden.
	<br><br>
	We entered the southernmost station on the tube - Morden, which is naturally served only by the Northern line, because the tube makes sense like that.
	<br><br>
	We then headed back up into London, initially with 3 entire carriages to ourselves. Along the way, we did plenty of shouting, some dancing, (Matthew did some pole 
	dancing), cracked some 'jokes', jumped on and off, ticking off all the southern stations. We finally changed trains at Clapham Common, where Matthew revealed his 
	proposal to TfL for naming the branches of the Northern Line, live on camera (it was much better than James' retarded suggestion), all on Clapham Common's 
	<i>slim</i> platform, so narrow at the end, that you could reach out and touch the north and soundbound trains simultaneously.
	<br><br>
	We passed Kennington, where the Northern Line Extension will immenently be opening, then changed at Elephant and Castle to the Bakerloo, and ticked off our final 
	tube station in Saaaaf London, Lambeth North. Lambeth North: TICK!
	<br><br>
	<strong>"I like the Bakerloo. It is nice and cool"</strong>
	<br><br>
	Needless to say, by the time we reached the opposite terminus of the line, half an hour later, 15 degrees warmer, covered in sweat and having sat next to some 
	lost Welsh tourists (*spits*), James had retracted this assertion.
	<br><br>
	We walked back to Matthew's house, passing Queen's Park and a flock of parakeets, buying onward tickets, and planning how the fuck we were meant to transport a broken 
	suitcase, 2 full bags and a bike to Paddington on a killed tube and an RRB/tube line that banned bikes. This was going to be the most fun segment of them all!
	<br><br>
	<strong>"I am going to grab your scrawny little neck and snap it"</strong>
	<br><br>
	We arrived home and James tore apart his various bags, packing and repacking them into a potentially suitable configuration. After about half an hour, he was ready, and 
	we set off with less than 35 minutes to go; a bus journey, killed tube, many staircases and a bike ride to surmount.
	<br><br>
	James dragged his suitcase over to the nearest bus stop, almost ripping it to pieces in the process, and we waited 7 minutes for the 316 bus towards Queens Park. 
	The moment it arrived, Matthew crossed the road, waited for confirmation that James was on the bus, and immediately floored it at full pelt towards Ladbroke Grove, 
	then turned onto the canal (fucking up his gear changes), then sprinting full out all the way to Paddington. The race was on! Who could win along an identical route? 
	A bus and the tube, or Matthew fuelled by fear and a time-deadline?
	<br><br>
	James soon arrived at Queens Park, carted his suitcase down the staircase and made it to the platform, only to discover that the Bakerloo was completely kill and had 
	decided to just not show up today. Fuck. This was bad.
	<br><br>
	Meanwhile, Matthew was screaming towards Paddington. He accelerated past the "slow down" signs and plowed straight onto the cobbled section outside St Mary's, causing 
	the bike's poor bell to have a spastic. Realising that he had made a wrong turn, Matthew then doubled back, cycling straight through the taxi rank, then ran with the 
	bike through the H&C station onto the concourse. The time was 20:29. The ride had taken him about 12 minutes - not bad.
	<br><br>
	He called James to see where he was, but received not even a dialling tone - James was still on the tube (at least that gives us a winner). Matthew then saw the message 
	from James "Overloo is kill" - sent a mere 2 minutes before Matthew had arrived in PAD. Fuck.
	<br><br>
	The minutes ticked down as the departure time came ever closer.
	<br><br>
	Fortunately, at the last moment, James came up the escalator and into the station, reuniting with his bike and shuffling awkwardly, laden down with all his worldly 
	possessions, through the ticket barrier and onto the train. Koppa 7 was finally kill, just like everything else that day.
	<br><br>
	Addendum: the journey home was fun. Matthew had no Oyster card, so decided to walk along the dodgy canal in the fading light in an attempt to get stabbed. Meanwhile, 
	James had to deal with the world's angriest conductor, whom I'll call 'Simon' for continuity. He arrived in Oxford, called a taxi, 'locked' his bike, watched his bag 
	die, and then arrived at Teddy Hall. After being shown his spew-covered room, he took out all his pent-up anger on the weary porter who gave him a new room and some 
	free food in an attempt to placate him. And as we know well, there is nothing that appeases a tired and angry James more than free food.
	<br><br>
	SINGLE TAKE!
