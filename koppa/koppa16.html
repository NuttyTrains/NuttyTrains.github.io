    James and Matthew revisit Koppa 1, visit Bond St, take a through train on the 1st day of Crossrail Phase 2, and get bored of the big city. Sigh

    <strong>WELCOME TO THE AMNESIA ZONE!</strong>

    Matthew has at last broken through the worst of the depression, and has now started to get giga-anxiety! In this 8th episode, we now enter what is 
    quite frankly a total void. Seriously - I have no idea what these next few adventures consist of, and by this point, neither does James. This'll be fun!
