    NT meets the Queen again! Let's see how many lines are closed or melted on this unlucky adventure!
    <br><br>
    Well this turned out nothing like expected. We failed all the original objectives, and ended up on the wrong side of London entirely. All in a day's work.

    <strong>WELCOME BACK TO THE AMNESIA ZONE!</strong>
    <br><br>
    As Matthew continues upon his archaeological dig through the past 2 years of content that may or may not have been lost to the mists of time, 
    we now reach Koppa 13, a monster of an adventure. Excuse any mistakes as he attempts to badly reconstruct the traumas of 2022/23...

Guess who just found his first grey hair

What the fuck

    The plan for today was to begin in Windsor, basically where we had left off last time (Xi 5), and to try and do as much damage to the map 
    in SW London as was possible - today was to be a day of bouncing back and forth on trains, trying to mop things up. Having most 
    recently completed Koppa 17 and 18... past James and Matthew did not do the best job.

    As you can perhaps see, we did not have the easiest time when getting to Slough. This gave Matthew plenty of time to explore 
    Slough, but the details were so horrifying, dear readers, that I couldn't possibly accurately relay them to you without 
    first giving you a health warning...

    Fortunately, relief soon arrived in the form of a delayed James, and we proceeded to Windsor for our second meeting with the 
    Queen!
