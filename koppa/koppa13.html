    NT meets the Queen again! Let's see how many lines are closed or melted on this unlucky adventure!
    <br><br>
    Well this turned out nothing like expected. We failed all the original objectives, and ended up on the wrong side of London entirely. All in a day's work.

    <strong>WELCOME BACK TO THE AMNESIA ZONE!</strong>
    <br><br>
    As Matthew continues upon his archaeological dig through the past 2 years of content that may or may not have been lost to the mists of time, 
    we now reach Koppa 13, a monster of an adventure. Excuse any mistakes as he attempts to badly reconstruct the traumas of 2022/23...

    The plan for today was to begin in Windsor, basically where we had left off last time (Xi 5), and to try and do as much damage to the map 
    in SW London as was possible - today was to be a day of bouncing back and forth on trains, trying to mop things up. Having most 
    recently completed Koppa 17 and 18... past James and Matthew did not do the best job. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt - 
    maybe the 40C heatwave made life hard...

    As you can perhaps see, we did not have the easiest time when getting to Slough. This gave Matthew plenty of time to explore 
    Slough, but the details were so horrifying, dear readers, that I couldn't possibly accurately relay them to you without 
    first giving you a health warning...

    Fortunately, relief soon arrived in the form of a delayed James, and we proceeded to Windsor for our second meeting with the 
    Queen! Windsor during the day was actually very lovely - we had a nice stroll across the Thames, walked towards Eton college, 
    and got a better view of the castle this time. We messed about in Windsor for a non-trivial amount of time, before heading 
    to Windsor's second station (by the Riverside) to begin today's nuttiness.
    <br><br>
    Unfortunately I now have 0 recollection of our route, but the NT website informs me that we then took a train via Wraysbury 
    back into London. Clearly the amnesia was beginning to set in at this point, because Xi 5 was fairly easy to write, but this 
    one is just a black hole.
    <br><br>
    We probably then changed at Clapham Junction, after ticking off a good number of stations, and headed south towards Guildford. 
    There are many, many lines that reach Guildford, as we have learned over the course of a few adventures. Despite starting there 
    on Koppa 11, we were still no closer to ticking them all off - well that was about to change. We took the line via Cobham and 
    Stoke D'Abernon (the most upper class-sounding station name on the entire network: tick) down to Guildford, and left immediately, 
    by taking the line up to Woking.
    <br><br>
    Woking is always good fun. Knowing us, we probably immediately headed back to our favourite location - Woking Pizza Express

    We interrupt this NT broadcast for Matthew to have a brief mental breakdown, as he realises it may no longer be appropriate

    We headed back to the station to find Woking on fire. No, that is not an exaggeration, the sky was filled with smoke (the 
    below photo does not do it justice). It actually got significantly worse as we left the town and headed out into the fields. 
    Something was clearly very wrong... classic NT.

    Then, inexplicably, we jump all the way to Battersea Park on the station list. I presume that we once again took a train to 
    Clapham Junction and changed, but honestly, I have no fucking clue.
    <br><br>
    We pulled into Victoria, which must have been one of our final London termini at this point, and debated our next move. We had 
    many potential options out of Victoria, given that we barely had touched South London. But no, South London is awful, so we 
    decided to go somewhere nicer - South Kensington. At this point, the reader may be confused - surely we had been to South 
    Kensington before? Yes dear reader, we had, but you must remember that we imposed upon ourselves the condition that we must 
    visit every station on every line! But again, the reader may be confused: surely, of all the stations, <i>South Kensington</i> 
    would have been ticked off long ago? Alas, dear reader - that was simply not true. Since early Covid, South Kensington had been 
    closed on the Piccadilly line for engineering works, meaning we were unable to complete this very important station. But finally, 
    it had belatedly reopened, and what a better station at which to complete the tube? James was less impressed at this news:
    <br><br>
    <strong>There are two blue lines?!?!</strong>
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/South Kensington.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
    With the tube under our belt, we returned to Victoria to plunge south into the heart of South London *shudders*. We were headed 
    straight for *shivers* West Croydon. In fact, we were yet again retracing our steps from Koppa 11, and headed for Sutton, 
    but with no detour via Sutton library/Sutton Premier Inn -- no, this time, we were off to complete a loop around Sutton 
    (and not the one you are thinking of on Thameslink - that would be too smart for NT). We would be taking a southern service to 
    Sutton, and changing to a Thameslink train.
    <br><br>
    <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fbZTnZDvPA">Making bad decisions, for you.</a></strong>
    <br><br>
    Alas, this was indeed a bad decision, for you. South London is miserable and we hate it. James was so done that they wanted to 
    quit entirely - fuck all the stations, if all the stations are this fucking grim. Even Matthew, usually in his element in 
    horrible London stations, was beginning to feel down. Therefore, Matthew made a split-second, last-minute decision (naturally, 
    telling almost none of this plan to James) - we were to leap off the train at Sutton, tap out, buy 2 returns to St Albans, sprint 
    back to the barriers, and leap upon the approaching Thameslink train - fuck the south, we were going north!
    <br><br>
    Astonishingly for a half-baked plan like this... it worked! Within a few minutes we were back on our intended Thameslink train, 
    except this time, to stay! We were going to stay on this train all the way up the Sutton loop, through James' most favourite 
    stabbing location of all time (Streatham), through central London and out beyond the M25, through Radlett, to St Albans. 
    Naturally, TB got carried away, and whisked us off to glorious, wondrous Luton Airport. Having since ticked off that station (Xi 
    10), I can confirm that this station and its passengers are just as glorious as TB could have ever imagined with his 2kB of 
    RAM. RIP TB - your spew was too good for Twitter.

    We began this day in a town with 2 stations, and we would begin this final leg in a similar manner. St Albans has 2 stations, 
    and mercifully for James, Matthew had accidentally started at the station on top of the hill. Matthew had fairly recently 
    visited the town, so gave James a little tour. I don't recall James being particularly impressed, but they enjoyed seeing the 
    occasional Roman artifact that we were able to squeeze en route (we were very, very tight for time). At some point we shall 
    have to have a special Roman adventure... probably in 2030 or summat.

<p>
    We took the pretty branch line down to Watford (I know it sounds really grim, but having walked half of it on an Aleph, I 
    can confirm that it is actually 10x prettier than it sounds), ticking off a few more stations, before arriving in Watford 
    Junction... where every train north of London had died. It was a warzone - the smoke over Woking would have been more 
    appropriate here, ngl. I have no idea how we got home from here, and we left no clues on discord, so I am forced to 
    conclude that we teleported home - Matthew to Kensal Green, and James on a miserable train via Reading. Perhaps the videos 
    will one day shed some light on this, when they come out in 2028...
