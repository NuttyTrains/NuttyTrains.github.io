    Hello and welcome to the live updates section of Koppa 18! Matthew is currently travelling via the most unusual and inconvenient 
    route from Leeds to London, thanks to every train giving up and dying.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>06:25: I leave the house, walk to the bus stop and find that the next bus is in 17 minutes. Great. Guess I am walking</li>
    <li>06:50: Finally on the bus. On y va</li>
    <li>07:05: I arrive at Leeds station to find there are no London-bound trains. Curious. I go to the help desk and learn that 
        yet a-fucking-gain, the overhead lines at Stevenage are down. Fantastic. No trains are travelling beyond Peterborough, 
        so I am royally screwed. The advice is to take the 07:38 to Lincoln and change at Sheffield, but instead I take my original 
        train to Wakefield Westgate. I could do with the walk, before I explode.
    </li>
    <li>07:45: I arrive at Wakefield Kirkgate and board that same Lincoln train at 07:56, and quickly learn that my plan to change 
        at Sheffield has essentially been foiled - the first trains out of Sheffield have also been cancelled. New plan - take 
        the 08:56 to Derby, make a platform change and arrive at St Pancras at 11:09. Wish me luck...
    </li>
    <li>08:45: Thanks to the heroism of my conductor on the Lincoln train, who held the next London-bound train at Sheffield for 2 
        minutes, allowing me to catch an earlier train, with a new eta at St Pancras at 10:39
    </li>
    <li>09:30: Currently sat on the floor on my EMR train en route to Leicester. I have pins and needles.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    At 10:39 I pulled into St Pancras and fought my way to the tube. At Waterloo I printed my latest NR-scamming tickets, and ran to 
    the first train to Clapham Junction, where I was about to execute a classic stupid NT move. My tickets for this adventure are not 
    valid via London terminals, and yet I was attempting to travel from a London terminal. Therefore my big brain idea was to use 
    Oyster to Clapham Junction, exit the station (tapping out), re-enter the station (with my ticket) and continue... all in 120 
    seconds.
    <br><br>
    At Clapham, I fought my way off the train, sprinted to the exit, tapped out, re-entered, and sprinted back to my new platform, 
    just as a train was arriving on the correct platform. Long-time readers may sense apprehension here - Matthew, don't do that - 
    you don't know where this train was going... Alas, Matthew does not learn from past experience. The same thing happened as on that 
    Aleph all those years ago. I ran on the train, and only realised something was wrong when the train went in the wrong direction. 
    RIP all our plans.
    <br><br>
    Eventually, with my spirit broken, we decided to meet in Weybridge. James had been having a very different morning - they 
    had headed to Basingstoke (our original plan), and had just settled down in Pret when Matthew whisked them back onto a train to 
    Weybridge. Finally, at almost 1 o'clock, we met, where they found Matthew reading about rats again. 
    <br><br>
    We took a weird but exceptionally useful train up to Virginia Water, via the West Staines massif, and then along the Hounslow 
    loop to Brentford, Kew Bridge and Chiswick. Given how close this line is to the Koppa heartlands, it felt extremely satisfying 
    to tick off, 16 adventures after we first tried back in 2020.
    <br><br>
    At Putney we reversed and headed to Richmond for lunch, returning to the White Swan from Koppa 5, where we had some very nice 
    food and 2 glasses of free wine each. Unfortunately, this establishment is ineligible for inclusion in the world-famous NT 
    Michelin guide, as we only include <i>Kwality</i> establishments. But as James loves being surrounded by well-to-do patrons, 
    and Matthew loves free things, this was a win-win situation. We probably spent 2 hours here.
    <br><br>
    Eventually though it was train time once again. We walked to St Margarets and boarded the train towards Kingston, hoping to 
    disembark at Teddington to change to the Shepperton branch. This did not happen. As we arrived, we learned that all Shepperton 
    trains had been cancelled with immediate effect, and were re-routed via Strawberry Hill... the previous station. RIP. It was 
    bus time.
    <br><br>
    Sometimes on Nutty Trains, usually as the twilight begins to draw in during a summer evening, we begin to wonder what the fuck 
    we are doing. We were in an eerily quiet outer suburban village, about to take a London bus. There was no valid reason as to 
    why we'd ever end up in a place like Teddington, yet here we were. This happens surprisingly regularly - it is basically a 
    hallmark of NT at this point. By Golly does it leave some poignant memories behind though - all of my lasting NT memories seem 
    to occur near sunset... 
    <br><br>
    The bus dropped us near Fulwell, which is the most tucked-away station we have ever seen - you had to go down a private road 
    at the back of a B&Q and the bus garage, then down a private path, only to find the station tucked into the cutting. We bought 
    our tickets for the branch and hopped on. Despite the branch leaving London and entering Surrey, the quality of this branch was... 
    mixed. There was some 'coun-tree-side(?)', but also some more familiar sights, like tarmac, concrete, 1960s Brutalism, motorway 
    overpasses, and soul-destroying carpets of bleak outer suburbanism, all in healthy enough doses to stop Matthew from having a 
    panic attack. James refused outright to acknowledge that this branch line to Shepperton could possibly be in Surrey - too crap 
    for that!
    <br><br>
    <strong>Oh thank God, a motorway overpass!</strong>
    <br><br>
    On the way back into London, a group of loud hooligans boarded the train - a premonition of things to come. As the train returned 
    to Twickenham, where we were to change yet again, we saw that essentially the entire station had been barracaded off. Turns out 
    that there was yet another major event on (some Bible concert). Indeed, this Saturday seems to have been an awful day for an 
    adventure full stop, given that <i>everyone</i> seemed to be performing or playing in London this weekend - Ascot was on, ABBA 
    was playing, Wimbledon may or may not have been happening, other people that I have now forgotten were also playing... to 
    borrow a phrase from James: 'it busy'.
    <br><br>
    Nevertheless, we doubled back yet again at Twickenham, leaving the hooligans behind as we passed through Kingston to complete that 
    line, and headed back to Clapham Junction for coffee and schnacks. This was where we made a awful, terrible realisation. Our old 
    faithful little camera was gone. Rest in peace, DJI camera. You have been our constant companion for 3 years of this insanity.
    <br><br>
    However, now that we were nice and caffeinated we geared up for our last trains of the day - the long boi all the way to Reading 
    via Ascot, which ticked off a handful of long-standing problem stations, and the perennially miserable Great Malvern train. This 
    one was especially miserable, as a very drunk woman kept stumbling back and forth up the aisle, shouting to her friends and 
    striking up conversation with strangers. To block it out, Matthew began reading, which prompted one of the sweetest NT exchanges 
    in years:
    <br><br>
    <strong>Woman: How are you doing that?<br>
    Matthew: What, reading?</strong>
    <br><br>
    We arrived back at Oxford, and as I am writing this we are preparing to go out and see Usman. The last time this happened, James 
    stumbled up to Matthew's house in Kensal Green, unable to recognise Matthew until the NT theme tune (his ringtone) started playing. 
    Whelp - if we die, we went out on a bang, but at least for the first time... a class of NT adventures has reached drinking age!
