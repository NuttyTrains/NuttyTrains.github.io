<p>
	Tonight on Nutty Trains, James nearly gets shanked in Brixton, Matthew abandons James in Moorgate, and we both attempt the DLR Challenge... whilst still 
	jumping on and off at every station!
	<br><br>
	After R<sub>0</sub>=7, Matthew started packing to head to London, and a mere week after having a day out in Lydney, he was in the car and on his way to 
	London. Once there, he was able to see that London was far less chocked than James had anticipated, meaning that if he could make it, then we could not only 
	have a Nutty Trains adventure, but we could have a <i>proper</i> NT adventure! So therefore, just days before Drakey started imposing local lockdowns and 
	tightening some restrictions, James bought his tickets to "Lydney" for the "diesel special day" and was off to PAD!

<p>
	Koppa 3 was yet another adventure planned with almost zero notice. Whilst we had wanted another Koppa before the second wave struck in Autumn, Markey's late night 
	supermarket booze ban (and the threat of impending future restrictions) had caught us off-guard - we could see Wales hurtling towards higher restrictions any day 
	now, and Matthew advised James to evacuate back to Kernow as soon as possible. Therefore, just the day before, we called whilst Matthew was walking back from Ealing 
	to Acton and to organise any last details for the NT adventure on the very next day, before Markey unleashed the Welsh Language Society's paramilitary wing to 
	blockade the Second Severn Crossing.
	<br><br>
	After being fucked over by the buses yet again (this always happens in our Lydney adventures!), he made it to the train station eventually, got on his Class 800, 
	and was soon moving, on his way to PAD! He spent the journey down working on Chinese (he found that train is 'fire vehicle' (火车) in Chinese!) and coursework, 
	occasionally tweeting, laughing at David (the Cornish train manager), admiring the replacement pacers at CDF, the purps at Reading, and generally getting scared 
	by the chock and how much of a bad idea this had been! James's train was set to arrive at 12:12, so he had plenty of time to enjoy the journey down, especially 
	as unlike our previous NT adventure, the trains weren't also determined to fuck him over, which was good, as he only would have a couple of hours in London, and 
	Markey was making his life hard enough as it was.
	<br><br>
	After a great journey down, James arrived at PAD, was promptly fucked over by the circle line and had a terrible connection, allowing Matthew, who had been slightly 
	behind, some time to catch up. Matthew had been asleep when James had his bus catastrophe, but was then up all morning, yet still managed to leave North Acton 
	slightly late, and was just about at White City when James pulled into Paddington. The intention was probably to meet at Notting Hill Gate, one of our original 
	tube stations (and one of Matthew's usual haunts), but quite frankly, despite Matthew doing much brain-racking and investigating Twitter, Discord and text, he can't 
	work out what the fuck we were doing, as he is currently writing this about 6 months after the actual event. :)
	<br><br>
	So let's assume for the sake of simplicity that we went to Notting Hill Gate, and roll the tape from there. We'd have then taken the central line down to Bank, 
	ready to begin our DLR challenge at 13:05! On that journey, Matthew would have pulled his tattered OSTC paper from his pocket, with a full and comprehensive plan 
	for how we would get a leaderboard time for the DLR challenge! We would leave Bank at 13:05, head to Shadwell, double back to Tower Gateway to pick off both City 
	termini, and then would head all the way out to glorious Beckton! Once there, we'd double back, leap off at Canning Town, tap out, tap back in and sprint to the 
	train, all in 1 minute (one of Matthew's finer plans, he will admit). We'd head to Woolwich Arsenal, double back to Stratford Int'l, get fucked over by shit 
	connections, make it back to Stratford, travel down to Canary Wharf, change trains, and end in Lewisham. This would give us a time of just over 2:20, we hoped.
	<br><br>
	At Bank, we leapt over the G A P, and journeyed through the warren of twisting, half-incomplete tunnels, right down the the under-construction DLR platforms at 
	the very bottom of the station, and awaited our alloted 13:05 train.
	<br><br>
	The train rocked up eventually, after we'd been suspiciously hanging around, missing the last 3 trains, and we boarded the front carriage, only to discover to 
	our absolute horror that the front seats were now taped off thanks to chock. Eheu! We'd miss the best bit of the journey! Never mind though, as we'd only get 1 
	section's worth at the front, thanks to our intention to resume jumping on and off dreckly. The doors closed, Matthew hit the stopwatch on his phone, and the 
	train eased out of the station - the NT DLR challenge had begun!
	<br><br>
	We climbed out of the long and steep tunnel, from underneath the bowels of the City, and onto the raised viaduct, giving us wide panoramas of the scenic East End. 
	Mmmmm. Unfortunately, unlike Matthew's last trip on the DLR, it was currently overcast and raining - not the 
	best weather in which to enjoy scenic East London. Before long, the first island station came into view - Shadwell. Again, being an exposed island station situated 
	directly in the middle of a wind- and rain-swept viaduct, this was also not the best weather in which to enjoy our surroundings. We hopped off, waved the train 
	goodbye, and immediately went to the other platform to start going in reverse - welcome to NT, where we do normal person things!
	<br><br>
	Fortunately for us, our time in the station was short-lived, as our reverse train soon rocked up. We boarded for our long 3 minute trek back into the city, pleased that 
	we would have shortly ticked off one fork of the DLR, despite this being a very slow section of the journey (and rather inefficient). The train pulled into Tower 
	Gateway, where we once again completely disembarked. To amuse ourselves during the turn-around time, we <s>walked</s> ran all the way around the front of the train 
	to the other platform and promptly reboarded. The train was shortly ready to depart, and we headed back for Shadwell - take 2!
	<br><br>
	We passed through Shadwell, which in accordance with NT rules, we did not have to jump out at (we had visited here before), and similarly passed through Limehouse and 
	Westferry without alighting. After hardly any time at all (less than 10 minutes after leaving Tower Gateway on our eastward trek), we had reached the DLR's rollercoaster 
	section at the junction leading down to Canary Wharf. Instead of taking our usual overpass track, we this time dived underneath that track on the underpass, veered to 
	the right and descended into Poplar station, our first new eastward station on the DLR - ad Beckton!
	<br><br>
	We passed yet another junction after Poplar, leading up to Stratford, and then continued East, ticking off station after station. On this particular NT adventure though, 
	we decided not to merely take photos of the station signs as we alighted - this was 2020 after all! Instead, we decided to film short 2-3 second clips of us exiting 
	the train, and walking up to the sign. James would later string these into an NT video, the results of which can be seen at the bottom of this account.
	<br><br>
	We passed Blackwall and East India, both of which were situated in highly redeveloped areas of East London, filled with glass stations and clustered modern apartment 
	buildings. We also killed some time sitting at the back of the front half of the train, and by standing on the rotating axle connecting the 2 carriages, which was 
	very amusing to do as we attempted to keep our balance - it was just like being drunk, whilst sober... like the rest of Nutty Trains!
	<br><br>
	We reached Canning Town, and had a brief scout around at Matthew's request, before we attempted the absolutely bats task of alighting, exiting, tapping out, tapping back 
	in, running to the other (location unknown) platform, and embarking, all in 1 minute. We then got back on the train, passed Royal Victoria and then Custom House, where 
	we spent all of our time peering out of the window, admiring the new Crossrail station, and desperately trying to catch glimpses of the elusive purple roundels - coming 
	to London, on the 33rd of Neverember 2222!
	<br><br>
	We jumped off at Prince Regent, Royal Albert, Beckton Park and Cyprus, the latter 2 of which were strange stations, situated underneath and in the middle of 
	absolutely enormous roundabouts. We then passed Gallions Reach, and watched as the train started to double back on itself, allowing us to get a good view of the 
	beautidul completely undeveloped post-industrial waterground: Beckton. Situated at the arse-end of London, in a rundown area, on an overcast day, Beckton kind 
	of felt like the valleys, to be perfectly honest. Ah, the valleys, the spiritual home of NT!
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Beckton.jpg" width="55%"></center><br>
<p>
	Before long, the train was ready to reverse up the line, so we reboarded and set off. This time, now that we were less preoccupied with spotting purple roundels, we 
	spent our time looking over at the Thames, which looked as grey and muddy as ever, and at London City Airport, which neither of us had ever seen before, and were very 
	surprised by how strange it looks. James found it very amusing, as it looked so odd, situated on a narrow strip in the Thames, with wasteground all around it. On the 
	way back to Canning Town, we also saw the ExCel centre, now redeveloped into the Nightingale hospital, which had barely been used during the first wave. It was quite 
	astonishing actually that we'd managed to completely miss it on the way out, but the purp train took priority over chock, I'm afraid.
	<br><br>
	Finally, we reached the crux point of our entire challenge - Canning Town. The train pulled into the interchange station, and we immediately ran out of the doors, 
	and sprinted down the long platform, completely ignoring all covid regulations, and simply legging it - NT was back in style! We sprinted to the end of the platform, 
	threw ourselves down the long staircase to street level, and ran to the ticket barrier to tap out. No sooner than we were out, we reversed, ran to the opposite end of 
	the barrier, and tapped back in, as at the top of the other staircase, we could see our train pulling into the station! We tapped in, ran even faster to the stairs and 
	leapt up them 3 at a time in a desperate bid to reach the top. We reached the platform and sprinted faster than ever before as the doors started to beep and flash at us. 
	We leapt inside right before they closed and ruined our chances of a leaderboard time. We'd made it, and all in less than 60 seconds!
	<br><br>
	The train then headed down our second eastern DLR branch, towards Woolwich Arsenal; Matthew spent much of the journey refusing point-blank to look south out of 
	the window, as he could see the <i>Dangleway</i> and he could feel his skin burning by merely being so close to it. We ticked off West Silvertown, Pontoon Dock and the 
	very long and classy London City Airport station. James had a small moment, confusing left and right, at the very strangely named King George V station, before we headed 
	underneath the Thames to Woolwich Arsenal. The station had a very metro vibe to it which was odd and felt un-London-y. Either way, we'd arrived, and would have all of 90 
	seconds until the train reversed back under the Thames, and up towards Stratford:
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Woolwich Arsenal.jpg" width="55%"></center><br>
<p>
	The train made its way back under the river, past the Airport, and back towards Canning Town. We passed through Canning Town for the third and final time, then mirrored 
	the Jubilee line on our next segment up to Stratford. We raced a Jubilee line train up to West Ham, after stopping at Star Lane, and somehow managed to beat it into West 
	Ham station - this was the pacer outpacing the sprinter all over again!
	<br><br>
	We jumped off at Abbey Road, which Matthew complained was one of the dumbest station names in all of London, as all the tourists are tricked into coming here, thinking 
	it is the location of the Beatles' Abbey Road studio (with the zebra crossing), only to find it is some dump in East London (James also fell for this deception). We then 
	went to Stratford High Street (which had been Matthew's mystery ¬station, which James correctly guessed and won a very special, hyper-personalised congratulatory tweet 
	as a result), then pulled into Stratford, which, thanks to Freya, Matthew knew quite well... just not the DLR bit. We got a bit confused, wandered up and down for a bit 
	along the platform, and eventually realised that we were on the correct train after all, and jumped back on. 
	<br><br>
	Finally, we headed up to Stratford International, which despite the small separation of the 2 stations, took a long and stupid route to connect the 2. We pulled into the 
	station on time, but thanks to the train timetable, were then fucked over by our terrible connection time. Matthew offered to sprint from 1 station to the other, but even 
	he realised that the scheduling was so bad that running wasn't worth it. Instead, we waited and watched the record time slip further out of our grasp, before returning to 
	Stratford. 
	<br><br>
	It was in Stratford that we approached the record time for the DLR Challenge, held by Hugo, James's nemesis. We arrived in Stratford, then left the station, as we had 
	oodles of time to kill. Matthew walked James up to Freya's flat, to show him, and on 
	our way back to the station we ran into a mad Nigerian preacher who told us we were sinners and would burn in hell, as well as seeing a man dressed in a Mickey Mouse 
	costume. We re-entered the station, trying to figure out how the one-way system to the other DLR line worked 
	(well, Matthew tried to work it out, James merely ignored it), and then waited on the other DLR platform for our train down to Canary Wharf.
	<br><br>
	The train departed and we started to tear through these stations at a rate of knots. We passed Pudding Mill Lane, then hit stations basically every 60 seconds - 
	Bow Church, Devons Road, Langdon Park, All Saints and Poplar. Devons Road caused James to gag - we had reached the devil station! All these stations seemed very small, 
	grimy and rundown, unlike the stations we had been to before. They were more like glorified bus stations than proper train stations. 
	We then crossed over the DLR's rollercoaster section, and pulled into West India Quay - a dinky little station, but neither of us 
	understood why it existed - it was honestly about 100 yards from the much bigger and better Canary Wharf station, and was basically useless. 
	<br><br>
	We pulled into Canary Wharf, where James had formerly been fucked over by TfL's ticketing system (see Koppa 1), expecting to have to wait for ages for our connection. 
	But then fortune smiled upon us, and a train from Bank almost immediately followed us into the station, and onto the opposite side of the platform - we were saved! 
	By some miracle, we jumped aboard, having had a sub-30 second connection, and were hoping that this would shave at least 4 minutes off our time, and would boost us 
	up the eventual leaderboard. Ad Lewisham!
	<br><br>
	We pulled into the equally close Heron Quays, followed by South Quay, Crossharbour, the delightfully named Mudchute, and Island Gardens, all of which were around 
	90 seconds apart - we were so close to the end now! The Isle of Dogs now feels far more like Manhattan than it did before, but James very much liked it though. 
	He could sense that the surrounding skyscrapers were definitely upper class, and he even went as far as saying that whilst we wasn't a City boy, he'd happily live 
	in this bit of London!
	<br><br>
	Island Gardens and Cutty Sark stations are both within the tunnel under the Thames, and actually felt a lot like tube stations. We passed Greenwich, the oldest station 
	in the world, Deptford Bridge and Elverson Road, and began the slow deceleration into the final station. We were by this point watching the seconds tick down, watching 
	our position slip down the leaderboard as we pulled into Lewisham. We stood by the door, with James filming on his phone, and with Matthew having his finger poised above 
	the stop button on his phone's stopwatch, waiting to end the clock. The train pulled to a halt, the button on the door lit up, we pressed it, stepped out, and the moment 
	Matthew's foot made contact with the platform, he stopped the clock at 2:16:40 - a perfectly respectable time! At the time of the challenge, we were officially certified 
	as the <a href="http://www.explorerticket.co.uk/tubechallenge/dlrtop.htm">29<sup>th</sup> fastest team</a> to ever complete the DLR! Optime! We'll go back and beat 
	that soon, so watch this space!
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Lewisham.jpg" width="55%"></center><br>
<p>
	Exhausted from our challenge, we slowly made our way through Lewisham station, went down some corridors, and followed directions to the national rail station 
	- our quickest method of returning to the city. We boarded pretty much the first train that arrived (a Southeastern), heading to Cannon Street. We ticked 
	off a couple of stations on the way there, before crossing the river and pulling into the heart of the city. The train down was very nice, but also rather 
	jolting for Matthew, who had already managed to forget what National Rail felt like after 2 weeks on the tube!
	<br><br>
	Cannon Street was much smaller, quieter and darker than we had anticipated, and we were quickly outside of the station, washing our hands with the 
	compulsory hand sanitiser and standing in the city. Standing? Outside? Not on a train? Pah! This couldn't be allowed to happen! To the tube!
	<br><br>
	We descended into the adjoining Cannon Street tube station, and waited for a circle line train to take us around the Aldgate loop, to patch up a gaping hole on 
	our completed tube map. The journey went off without a hitch until Moorgate (apart from Matthew complaining about having to take a circle line train), when the 
	roundel we needed a photo of was right at the very end of the platform. We both disembarked from our circle line train, and jogged over to the impressive-looking 
	roundel right at the very end of the platform to snap a photo. But then, the doors started to beep and close! Miss a tube train? Not a chance! Matthew shot 
	off like a bullet to try and catch the train, as this instinct was drilled into him - there was no way he could miss it! James was slightly slower, and ran off 
	after Matthew to try and catch not only him, but the closing doors! Matthew flew towards the train, almost going head over heels, before leaping through the closing 
	doors sideways, just about making it on... without James! James' last sight of Matthew was his one leg disappearing between the train doors. We stood, on opposite 
	sides of the doors, waving at one another, as the train departed Moorgate, leaving James abandoned on the platform. 
	<br><br>
	We'd joked about this happening at hundreds of earlier stations, but this was the first time that James had actually been left behind by a train. Therefore, at 
	Barbican, Matthew disembarked and waited for James, who had picked up a Met train. Meanwhile, Matthew stood in the cavity left by the railway/station, surrounded 
	by concrete monstrosities on all sides, trying to explain to a tourist that they were going in completely the wrong direction, before just handing her his tube 
	map, as James's train had pulled in, and he had seen James, having a laughing fit about what had just happened.
	<br><br>
	Now reunited, we passed through Farringdon, seeing the site of another Crossrail station, then disembarked at Kings Cross St Pancras, to pick up the misery line, 
	which we had not journeyed upon much (for good reason - it is shit). Matthew confidently strode through the mega-station, pretending that he knew exactly where 
	he was headed, and ended up at the misery line platforms. Just like always, he jumped upon the southbound train, confident that he was on the Charing Cross branch 
	(the intended line), and we watched as the train screamed into life and rumbled noisily down the tunnel. 
	<br><br>
	As ever, we jumped out at the next station, confident that this would be Euston... only to discover that it was in fact Angel. Fuck. Matthew had fucked up the 
	misery line. He had forgotten that the train that travels south to Euston is in fact the northbound train, not the southbound train, which was now taking us 
	back where we'd been, through Moorgate, Bank and London Bridge. Whilst this was fine (if not better) from a stations point of view, it was far worse from a time 
	and hunger point of view, the former of which James had little, and the latter plenty. Let me assure the reader that being trapped on a screaming, rumbling misery 
	line train with a tired, hungry and nervous James is no trivial ordeal.
	<br><br>
	Illi vitae! We headed south to Elephant and Castle, passed the new misery line branch at Kennington, and finally changed at Stockwell, onto the far more pleasant 
	Victoria line train to our, and its terminus in Brixton - the only Victoria line station we had yet to visit. The train pulled into Brixton after not much time at 
	all, and we had our traditional terminus photo:
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Brixton.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	We then headed up the escalator, and out into the large station atrium with a massive glass frontage, walked up the staircase to street level, and stepped out into 
	Brixton. Brixton station is rather stupid, as the slowverground passes quite literally directly overhead the tube station, yet has no connection - it swerves out of 
	the way. And this, ladies and gentlemen, is why the slowverground is terrible - it has no connections anywhere, unlike the magnificent Victoria line! Matthew had 
	never been to Brixton, as his opinions of Brixton had been heavily influenced by his dad, who had known Brixton in the late 80s, and thanks to whom, Matthew had to 
	restrain himself from always pronouncing Brixton with a Jamaican accent. James however, didn't care how shit or dangerous it was - he just wanted lunch!
	<br><br>
	However, it turned out that Matthew's ill opinions of Brixton were perhaps not too far from the truth. Our first point of call had been the little Sainsbury's just 
	up the road from the station, for a sandwich. Yet right outside, we witnessed a security guard yelling at a customer and beating him up. What a wonderful welcome. 
	We were in danger :)
	<br><br>
	We decided to maybe <i>not</i> go to the Sainsbury's, and instead look elsewhere for lunch. We settled upon the Subway across the road, despite Matthew reminding 
	James about what had happened the last time he had one in Shrewsbury, but illi vitae, we headed in. In front of us, we watched the man at the counter have great 
	difficulty describing his order to the lady serving him, whose English was evidently not quite up to scratch, and each formulated different strategies for 
	circumventing this. It was James's turn first, and he decided to order one of the standard sandwiches (even though he didn't really want that anyway), in the hope 
	that it would simplify ordering.
	<br><br>
	James: Hello, I'd like a 6-inch chicken and bacon, toasted, please<br>
	Lady: <i>Looks quizzically at James</i><br>
	James: A 6-inch chicken and bacon, please<br>
	Lady: Ummm? <i>Looks confusedly at ingredients</i><br>
	James: Chicken and bacon! <i>Points at chicken and bacon display on wall</i><br>
	Lady: We no do that here<br>
	James: Yes you do, it is on the wall <i>Points harder at wall</i><br>
	Lady <i>Goes back to consult with manager, then returns</i><br>
	Lady: How I help?<br>
	James: Could I have a 6-inch chicken and bacon standard sub please? <i>Points again at board</i><br>
	Lady: Umm? <i>Looks quizzically at board</i><br>
	James: Me like chicken and bacon <i>Rubs stomach patronisingly</i><br>
	Lady: Umm? <i>Looks confusedly around</i><br>
	James: I WANT A CHICKEN. AND. BACON!
	<br><br>
	After this, James gave up, but was so committed to having a chicken and bacon sub that he painfully constructed it, ingredient by ingredient, step by step, just 
	about holding his temper in. Once he'd sat down with his sub, the salt was rubbed further into the wound by Matthew painlessly ordering a completely custom sub, 
	communicating solely through pointing, hand gestures, and shaking his head, without saying a word apart from "Hullo". James was not best pleased when Matthew sat 
	next to him, laughing at his ordeal.
	<br><br>
	<strong>"If they can't speak English, they shouldn't have a job!"</strong>
	<br><br>
	We admired the shittiness that was Brixton as we ate our subs, but decided that this was a more pointed type of shittiness than we were used to in the valleys, and 
	that we actually felt decidedly unsafe here. We finished up quickly and left Subway, immediately crossed the road to the station, and tapped in, retreating down to 
	the Victoria line, and away from Brixton.
	<br><br>
	It was now not long until James's train home from Lydney, so we took a direct route to PAD. We took the Victoria line to Oxford Circus and changed to the Bakerloo, 
	ticking off a couple of new stations along the way, before arriving at PAD (this section actually triggered a bit of a crisis that evening for Matthew, who did not 
	know how to meticulously classify the Edgware Roads and Paddingtons, so spent the evening breaking up the tube table).
	<br><br>
	We passed the location of the potential chock case that had scared us in early Feb, walked over to the train, and said goodbye, as James boarded his GWR Class 800 
	(which he threatened to hijack and take to Kernow). But Matthew needed to run an errand in Ealing, so instead of heading down into the tube station, he boarded the 
	purp train on the far platform, and walked about halfway up the train.
	<br><br>
	Then the trains threw our NT adventure one last parting gift - they departed simultaneously! Thanks to the long stretch of track leading to Acton Mainline, and the 
	generally low speed of trains out of Paddington anyway, our trains were keeping pace! In fact, Matthew's purp train started gaining on James's Class 800! Matthew 
	started trekking up the through the carriages, to increase his velocity, to try and become level with James, at the front of the Class 800. He drew level with the 
	middle of the Class 800, when the Class 800 started to accelerate and pull away, leaving Matthew level with its rear carriage. But then the purp started gaining again, 
	and Matthew kept walking all the way to the front, where he almost drew level with James... but then ran out of train! The Class 800 accelerated off to Swansea, leaving 
	Matthew behind and James greatly amused by this episode.
	<br><br>
	Matthew had a brief shopping trip in Ealing Broadway for the upcoming academic year, and then headed back home. James meanwhile was dealing with having broken eyes, 
	as he started to witness a reverse sunset, something that isn't possibly until Mach 1.05, which Matthew highly doubted the train was doing. Methinks James needed a lie 
	down after his long day in Lydney!
	<br><br>
	3 months later, we would finally be certified as the 29<sup>th</sup> fastest team around the DLR, and shortly after that, James released this fantastic summary video 
	of the DLR challenge segment of Koppa 3! Go and take a look - there will be more videos in the future!
