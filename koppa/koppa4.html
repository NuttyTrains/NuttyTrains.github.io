	A trip to London 1 week before exams purely because James scammed some arts student? What a great idea! Cue a Chinatown extravaganza  and multiple failed attempts 
	to reach the edge of West London, all whilst the tube falls apart around us!
</p>
<p>
	James said to Matthew on his birthday, "Are you free tomorrow? I fancy scamming some art student out of their train tickets for a fiver each way". Matthew said he'd 
	be up for an adventure, and thus the stage was set! James hopped on the train at 6:30 in the morning, and he was off to PAD!

	He arrived in PAD 6 hours later, where he met Matthew leaving the circle-district, and we both barrelled down to the Bakerloo line to head to Chinatown. The rickety 
	ancient train screamed and rumbled and shook its way down the line as we sat there misanthropically like true Londoners. We got off at Piccadilly Circus, where 
	Matthew did some quick off-the-top-of-his-head calculations as to where on earth we were, quickly worked out which direction North was (to James's great amusement, 
	as in doing so, Matthew pointed in more directions than a weathervane), and we set off, passing TfL's new Orwellian art installation, and exited into Piccadilly 
	Circus, before walking the short distance to Chinatown, which James had been looking forward to immensely. We rounded the corner, and were greeted by the magnificent 
	Chinatown gate, which James had his picture in front of:
</p>

<p>
	James adored Chinatown. After a year of <s>being indoctrinated</s> studying the words of our glorious leader Xi Jing Ping, James was so excited to actually finally, be 
	surrounded by people speaking the language he had spent the best part of a year studying. They were not unimpressed by the amount of Chinese. IT WAS EVERYWHERE. China had 
	definately got it's grip on this area of London. All the restuarants had 烤鸭 spinning in the windows and there was Chinese supermarkets, selling a wide range of proudcts 
	from the glorious homeland, there was definately no Cantonese and definitely nothing to do with Hong Kong as that makes Big Daddy 西, very very unhappy. It was absolutely 
	packed everywhere, it had Chinese street signs, a plethora of authentic Chinese restaurants and Chinese lanterns strung up in every street - even the back alley's bins had 
	Chinese on them! We walked through the entirety of the enclave, before wandering up and down Gerrard Street, looking for a nice place to eat. We settled on Four Seasons, 
	and were quickly shown to an outside table, as indoor dining was not yet allowed. Matthew ordered some mixed seafood fried noodles and some vegetable spring rolls, and James 
	ordered 宫保鸡丁, 米饭, and 茶... in Chinese! The food was excellent, and we spent ages talking about China. The tea was delicious - some kind of <s>green lotus</s> Jasmine tea 
	(and their chopsticks were excellent too).
	<br><br>
	After paying, we went to 2 different Chinese supermarkets on Gerrard Street, where James bought some udon 面 and some 清涛啤酒 for his hash the next day. 
	Then we walked to Covent Garden, where he bought some cards to do a Faroh shuffle with in his upcoming magic show (also the next day), and had a wonderful conversation 
	with the stall-holder, which began as follows:
	<br><br>
	Stallholder: So are you an amateur magician?<br>
	James: No, no, I am a <strong>mathemagician</strong>!
	<br><br>
	It turns out that the stall-holder learned more from that conversation than James did himself! 
	After this, we walked to Holborn, narrowly avoiding the enormous anti-lockdown protest, getting slightly lost along the way, passing some Kings College London 
	buildings and walking along Drury Lane, before getting on the tube to begin the second half of our adventure! Our original plan had been to try and attack at 
	least 3 of the western branches of the tube: Heathrow, Uxbridge, and Amersham/Chesham. In Matthew's head, where time means very little at all, this seemed 
	like a fantastic idea and perfectly doable in the time we had left. But this was Matthew time, so as we would find out, this would be impossible.
	<br><br>
	We just missed the Piccadilly line train, and so we waited a few minutes and hopped on the next one to Rayners Lane. Almost immediately, it became apparent that 
	our original plan would be too time-consuming - the map in the station indicated that it was an hour to both Heathrow and Uxbridge. Yikes. This was much more than 
	Matthew had thought. Therefore, we abandoned our original Plan A of going to Heathrow, and instead decided to go straight to Uxbridge, with the hope of returning 
	to London via the Met. Before too long at all, the train pulled into the station, we jumped on, and it departed, screaming its way through the tunnels, like a 
	pacer with a megaphone, and rattled and shook the whole way. We had already done the first few stations, so once again, we sat there misanthropically. Then, when we 
	reached Hyde Park Corner, we started jumping on and off - NT had begun!
	<br><br>
	Leading on from Koppa 3, we decided to film little clips of each station, so out came the phone camera, to catch random out-of-context clips of station signs and 
	screaming trains, whilst we played the hokey cokey with the train doors, jumping back and forth, in and out, and switching carriages over and over, to the 
	confusion and annoyance of the other passengers. Soon, we arrived at South Kensington station, which was closed until 2022, and we saw the supremely strange 
	sight of the deserted platform, with a 5mph sign in bright yellow, and "STATION CLOSED" on all the roundels - very odd. What was most odd was that all the lights 
	were still on, and that the train slowed down to almost stopping speed - what was the point of that?
	<br><br>
	We passed through Matthew's home station, Gloucester Road, and before long we were above ground (which James preferred), and were zipping through leafy West 
	London. After Hammersmith we reached the long sprint section of the Piccadilly, where Matthew has previously zipped past and overtaken 3 district trains in one 
	journey. This time however, we were disappointed - no district line trains to be seen, and indeed, we were overtaken by the train behind us at Acton Town, to 
	Matthew's dismay and astonishment. We then headed up to North Ealing, where we decided to wait until the next Uxbridge train, as North Ealing is a nice quaint station.
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/North Ealing.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	This was soon to be a mistake. We got off, and found an empty dot matrix (a very rare sight), and Matthew became suspicious that something was up. 
	We decided to kill time by exploring the station. Initially, we wandered up and down the northbound platform remarking at how quaint the station was (it helped that 
	it was a beautiful, quiet day). We crossed over the little wooden bridge to the other platform, and saw the wood-panelled tube roundels. We walked to the very end of 
	the platform, and Matthew began to measure the length of the entire platform with his feet, just like Vicki in All The Stations. 
	<br><br>
	Shortly after, we were greeted with the announcement "Due to a customer incident, there will be no trains for 35 minutes". Fuck. Why are the trains always, always 
	fucked whenever James comes to London? Determined to kill time, Matthew killed time by continuing to measure the platform with his feet (roughly a foot long), to the 
	confusion and amusement of the increasingly busy station, as James filmed the entire thing. Finally, he finished - it was 311 Matthew feet long!
	<br><br>
	<strong>James: This one's for the foot fetishists!</strong>
	<br><br>
	We crossed back over the bridge, investigated the rare free station toilets (well, free for women - men have to cross the ticket line if they want to use them), and 
	then left the station in search of Plan C - West Acton. We walked through Hanger Hill, which was very beautiful (and James greatly approved - he had a new 
	favourite area!). The entire place is interwar, mock-Tudor housing, and it is right next to Ealing and 2 tube stations, and has a very calm and quiet air to it.

	Plan C involved doubling back on ourselves by taking the central line to North Acton, then heading up to West Ruislip. What had initially been a plan to visit all 
	the western termini was now looking to become a desperate attempt to reach the west, one way or another! West Acton was a nice station, with lovely curved benches, 
	as Matthew demonstrated, and a big glass front. Soon, the train arrived and we headed to North Acton, to find the train already at the other platform. Matthew 
	knew deep down the train was taunting him, and that he'd never make it, but when he reached the top of the stairs, the call became too great, and he sprinted for 
	his life, through the whole station, and we caught the train from the other platform to West Ruislip. 
	<br><br>
	This trip finished off the entire western section of the central line for us, as we headed further into Outer London than ever before, and it became greener and 
	leafier with every stop. Along the way, James started talking to his friend from Epping, who seemed to have no clue where one might find Chinatown and tube roundels - 
	certainly not London! Soon we were in NR territory and nearing Boris's constituency - Ruislip. We arrived at the terminus, had a brief explore of the station, 
	taunted James's friend from Epping with more random pictures of London (without context), including a picture of the dot-matrix, detailing a long list of trains all 
	headed straight to Epping. We walked over to the NR platforms, and looked down the track at the wide open green fields that awaited us at the edge of London - 
	Matthew's expedition now became feverish - we HAD to reach the edge! Thus, we started a "short walk" to find the very edge of London!
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/West Ruislip.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	We turned left out of the station, and walked down into Ickenham (via Tesco for James to buy water to clean his soot-encrusted throat - his country lungs can't deal 
	with the city air), and passed the lovely village pub and posh village centre. Were it not for the TfL roundels, we could have been literally anywhere in the home 
	counties - it didn't even feel like London anymore! You could feel the Toryness eminating from every building: if there ever was a place called Middlesex, we had sure 
	as hell reached it. It was lovely. We turned right at the village centre, and walked up the gentle slope for a "5 minute walk" to the edge.
	<br><br>
	Soon enough though, Matthew's "5 minute walk" had turned into an almost 20 minute walk, and was stretching on far too long, so after passing a house with giant TfL 
	lettering outside, we had to turn back, despite the edge of London being merely 200 yards ahead of us, and visible for the first time, crushing Matthew's final plan. 
	To Matthew's great upset, he decided that we should turn back, breaking his heart. We then briskly walked back to the tube station, in the hope of making James's 
	train: it was going to be tight!
	<br><br>
	As we reached the station, with James struggling under the weight of his bag, the train we wanted pulled out of the station before our very eyes, forcing us to wait 
	for the next one. Fortunately, the Central line, alone out of all the lines, which had decided to break now that James had brought the Curse of Kernow with him, 
	performed excellently, and barrelled down the line in no time at all, talking about Ted Cruz, Maggie, and how long the "short walk" to PAD was going to be. We spent 
	much of the journey down enjoying the sweet nectar of NF and arguing with TimeBot:

	We passed North Acton, dived underground at White City, then made the executive decision that we didn't trust the circle line, so would chance the walk from Lancaster 
	Gate. We arrived in Lancaster Gate on time... with about 5 minutes to go. We were operating on Matthew Time<sup>TM</sup> now! Matthew grabbed James's bag, and started 
	legging it!
	<br><br>
	We legged it to the lift, rose to the surface, and then ran for 3 minutes flat to Paddington. Why the fuck do we do this to ourselves? Why does every adventure end 
	in an unpleasant sprint for a train, when we are both already dead? We sprinted across 2 dual carriageways and along a long street to the new Crossrail station 
	entrance, and James thought we'd missed the train. We were both absolutely destroyed by the run, but we had in fact made it with 2 minutes to spare! We dashed inside, 
	James grabbed his bag, passed through the ticket barrier, and boarded his train... except his seat was on the other end, and he couldn't get to it. Bugger. Instead, 
	he settled for a first class seat in the back half of the train, and had a 6 hour journey home, doing Chinese, video-editing, and watching anti-lockdown protestors 
	being beaten up by the crackheads of Kernow for crack money.
	<br><br>
	When James arrived into Plymouth, he had a problem (and that problem is transport, it take very very long as Kernow is big. Throw First Kernow, so my country can be free,
	so my county can be free. We shall travel nationalised and have big party.). He was quietly working through the edit and then an ear piercing noise errupted from the old man 
	with a cane infront of him. He was sitting at a table with a stack of old, crumpled newspaper (from the 80s), three books that looked as if they had been chucked to the floor 
	and stood on and two GWR paper cups. Now, usually in these cups, you hold tea, coffee, or maybe even apple and orange juice. However, this man had hot water in them, not just hot water 
	but hot water infused with hole eggs. He was trying to cook eggs in GWR cups on a train with just hot water. Mmmmmmmm, yummy, food poisoning.
</p>
<blockquote>MY EGGGGSSSS, YOU'VE TAKEN MY EEGGGGGGSSS</blockquote>
<p>
	The fuck? This has to the worst crack<s>head</s>egg, James has come across and they lived in Camborne! We pulled up to Plymouth and the man collected his stuff and got off the train 
	and then decided that he was going to propel himself out of the door as it was closing. After flying through the air, the man slumped onto the floor like a sack of old potatoes. After 
	getting back to his feet, and after the train had started to leave, he starting on the train, proclaiming his eggs were the work of god and he needed them in order to live. The train pulled 
	off as he slammed the side of the train.
	<br><br><br>
	Update (pre-Koppa 5): James has finally released the excellent summary video, complete with NT Intro!!!
