	James: Hello, we are James and Matthew, and we have been doing the #IKEAmeansIKEA challenge too!<br>
	Hugo: Really? Have you been to all the IKEAs?<br>
	James: ...No?<br>
	<br><br>
	James returned to London in the new year, between 31st Jan and 2nd Feb, to start 2020 off right with some NT 
	nuttiness! Cue more incoherent screaming from James about how bleddy amazing everything is, and more inaudible mutterings from 
	Matthew about how the Circle line is delayed again. This will be our biggest adventure yet, as it will (intentionally) span 
	multiple days! Did our final remaining scraps of sanity leave us before the UK leaves the EU at 11pm on the Friday? Tune into 
	Twitter to get shitty, inaccurate, automated updates all night!

	Koppa 2 started early on Friday afternoon, as Matthew spent most of the afternoon tracking James's journey through chocky city.
	After only a minor delay in getting his stuff printed, Matthew took the District and Jubilee lines to Waterloo to meet James for yet more nuttiness!
	We met in Waterloo (but not under the station clock), and James showed off his new power-walking skills. We went down the escalator to the Jubilee line, into 
	the abyss, and went to Green Park, where we did the walk of death, weaving in and out of all the normal people going at half the speed. It should be noted that 
	James had a very heavy bag on him with all his Uni things and this stuff for the weekend, this was not unknown to the people passing by as anybody either too small 
	was knocked clean unconscious from the heft or was bent double as the mass was thrusted into their stomach. Due to a problem on the Central line, and because Matthew 
	was too impatient to wait any more than 30 seconds for a train, we took the Piccadilly to Acton Town, being absolutely rammed into the carriage full of commuters 
	heading home. James started laughing insanely, as we were squeezed in tighter than he'd ever been before on a train. Amongst the commuters was a couple making out 
	and giving slobbery kisses to one another, right up close to everyone else's faces, to everyone else's disdain. If it wasn't totally illegal James would have happily 
	gave them the same fate as the poor Child on the walk of death (which lived up to it's name, finally). Noice. There was also a very angry Polish guy who seemed to be 
	making death threats over the phone. What an introduction to London! We then changed to the District for Ealing Broadway. 
	<br><br>
	Matthew then went home to do some chores whilst James went to the Premier Inn, to join Matthew at just gone 7. We then watched some of each others' lectures 
	(RTom and P<sup>3</sup>, now that James had embraced the joys of Panopto and was no longer attending uni in person (apart from to make fun of his lecturers, 
	including MO, who believed that numbers stopped at 12.), and looked at each other's problem sheets before heading out at half 8. We took the Central line all
	the way to St Pauls, passed the stock exchange at Paternoster Square, and went to Wagamamas, where we had spicy (but cold) katsu curry, pad thai, and dishwater, 
	upmarketed to be called 'Green Tea' (I see this is a case for Trading Standards). Honestly, what on earth was that 'green tea'? The Nutty Trains twitter account 
	made it very clear to our n followers that this was very displeasing. We left at half 10, and <s>Matthew</s> calculated that we had enough time to squeeze in an 
	extra loop before Brexit hour, and so began the madness!

	We took the Central line 1 stop to Bank, whereupon we ran through the commuters like maniacs, running down the escalators, pushing one another (James 
	ending up tumbling down the stairs), before then changing to the W&C (which was very sweet, albeit loud), heading along the entire length of the line to 
	Waterloo (completing the first tube line). At this point 11pm was closing in rapidly and James was starting to worry. He wanted to be out on the Thames 
	for when we left the EU. We ran up to the Bakerloo (James still checking the time on his phone and almost missing a ticket barrier in the process), 
	and caught the train to Embankment (Which I believe was the location of the Alice in Wonderland corridor, but I am probably wrong). We switched maniacally to the District 
	to Monument. At this point James was sure we were to miss it.
	<br><br>
</p>
	<blockquote> Get ready, we have to run </blockquote>
<p>
	and as soon as those red doors opened we legged it. Across the platform pushing several old women and commuters out of the way. Turning left and up the stairs, 
	we were going to be there for Brexit. Up into the inky blackness of the smog we ran, tapping out like real commuters. We then ran over the flying pavement over a 
	busy road and almost slipping on the water or ice or just drudge that lied there. We then squealed to a stop as we spiralled around and up towards the barbican-esque 
	viewing platform we now know oh so well. Arriving at a viewing balcony at 10.57pm, overlooking the Thames, Tower Bridge and the Shard for the exact time of Britain 
	leaving the EU. We reminisced about how long ago the referendum was (it predates Alpha 2!), including James's famous business powerpoint about Greece in the EU!
</p>
	<center><img src="../resources/photos/Monument.jpg" width="55%"></center><br>
<p>
	Deciding to keep clear of the huge crowds at Westminster, we then went back (after James did some vandalism, ripping off any pro-EU posters he saw, in 
	full view of any CCTV cameras (but don't worry, only his <strong>REDACTED</strong> friends were watching, long live Big Bwother uWu)), and took the District one stop 
	before it went out of service. We then took the Circle to Liverpool St, before switching to the Central to Stratford (which was a rammed train and 
	station, but only on the National Rail platforms, why?!?!? Wake up sheeple.). We then wandered through the Westfield Centre (accidentally passing an IKEA in Stratford - 
	tick!). This place was massive, not like massive massive but massive. There were several gangs selling drugs, old dears smoking pot and knife crime all around. This was 
	a nice place. To add salt into the wound that at this point James couldn't feel, there were huge columns with triangular flicky lights. These were of huge interest, but 
	neither of us felt safe enough to stop and give them a good look. So we continued on to the Olympic Park, surely a safer area. We wanted to see how it had changed in the 
	last 8 years, and found that it was completely desolate and rather eerie. Some of the lesser-used (ie, non-football) stadiums were practically falling to pieces! After 
	getting only slightly lost getting there and back and nearly assaulted standing outside the football stadium, we went through the crowds of smokers and druggees outside 
	the Westfield shopping centre (it felt just like home), before retreating across a long bridge back to the (still busy) station. We then got back on the train, went one 
	stop to Leyton for a ceremonial photo (Matthew regrets not having his top hat), before returning home. Onto day 2!

<p>
	<emph> Addendum: James is <strong>hungry</strong></emph>
	<br><br>
	James had just left Matthew and was on the train back to Ealing Broadway and his stomach, and throat, told him he was hungry and hadn't drunk anything for a good few 
	hours. Ah, this was an amazing time to feel like this at, *checks phone*, 1:23am. Everything was shut and James left the station and started to wander down the road 
	considering going into a bar and having a pint to cease his hunger and thirst (he was rather delerious at this point). He then looked at the bouncer and he was staring 
	him down, he didn't both and carried on walking down the road. James staggered, at this point his feet hurt, towards the hotel and say the golden light of the golden 
	arches. His savior. God was real. This was the best course of action. He <s>entered</s> pushed past a group of girls and their associated drugged up boyfriends / whatever 
	they were at that point, one seemed to be a cat. They make spice different to how it is in Camborne. So he went over and ordered a lemonade and something to eat. He then 
	and went and stood away while the Bouncer approached James,
	<br><br>
	<strong> Bouncer </strong> (South London Accent) : You don't look drunk or drugged, you alright pal.<br>
	James : I'm good, just slightly insane.<br>
	<strong> Bouncer </strong> : Aren't we all pal? Aren't we all? <br>
	The bouncer went his way and James stood there waiting and idly watching a drunk young couple ordering and arguing about their 'meal'. James felt a light tapping on his shoulder, shocked by somebody 
	actually touching him, he turned around startled to see a slight girl, who also didn't seem to be drunk.
	<br><br>
	Girl : Hey, Mike said you weren't drunk.<br>
	James : Uhhh, well no. Why is that an important information<br>
	Girl: Well...
</p>
	<blockquote> Order 81 </blockquote><br>
	<p>James scuttled off to get his food, never to see the girl again. He is inclined to mention he walked her home as she was literally just scared of the druggies and <emph> nothing else</emph> 
	(his unfound aceness made sure of that.)

	Day 2 started much earlier, when James headed off to Parkrun (in Gunnersbury Park, Geoff's home turf), managing to get terribly lost whilst getting to and 
	from Parkrun on various busses. At some point in the distant future, James will add his parkrun adventures to the Aleph list - stay tuned! 
	Matthew meanwhile had a load of chores to complete, and all was going flawlessly - until he tried to shop in Asda without his 
	wallet. Fantastic. We then met at Woodward, communicating via Twitter, and planned our course of action for the day. Here is a blast from the past, writing 
	this account towards the end of the first lockdown in early August: the UK's first 2 coronavirus cases had been detected only the previous day, and a third 
	Chinese tourist had been detained in Paddington due to having suspicious symptoms. Therefore, James was very worried about heading too near the station. He 
	clearly had better foresight than I, as I spent much of the morning laughing about it! (Quoting Matthew he only worried about COVID once he got kicked out of the MLC).
	<br><br>
	Trying to avoid Paddington to not get Coronavirus (henceforth referred to as "getting chocked"), we headed into London via the Central line, from North Acton 
	to NHG, changed to the District, and headed one stop south to Kensington High Street. There, we saw what must have been a miracle (either that, or TfL had 
	fucked the trains up again) - a rare train to Kensington Olympia! We immediately changed all our plans and took the train all of 2 stops to the crowning glory 
	of our tube station list:

<p>
	This did leave us with a minor problem though - we had wanted to get food in Kensington High Street... which we had just departed from. "No problem" said 
	Matthew, "it is only a <strong>short</strong> walk!". Those, James would definitely realise by Sunday, were fateful words indeed. We walked over a <s>10</s>mile<s>s</s> to Pret, right at the 
	other end of the street, whereupon James bankrupted himself and Matthew blanched at the prices, before walking back, whilst James complained about Matthew's 
	poor perception of distance, and the general rudeness of Londoners and chomped on some soup which was more extensive than his house.
	<br><br>
	We took the slowverground to Willesden Junction, via Shepherd's Bush and over London's equivalent to the Neath Valley (the Westway, the Grand Union Canal, 
	2 mainline and another large road), wherupon we ran maniacally around the vast ludicrousness of the amalgam that is Willesden Junction (it is comprised of 
	3 small stations, all fused together via a system of long subways and flying corridors). We then doubled back on ourselves, back down the line to Richmond.
</p>
	<center><img src="../resources/photos/Richmond.jpg" width="55%"></center><br>
<p>
	In this time, James had been checking Twitter, and discovered that the #IKEAmeansIKEA challenge that had been rumoured to be taking place that day was indeed 
	happening: numerous transport/maths twitter accounts were aiming to visit every Ikea in London in a single day (or so we thought), and so we immediately 
	decided to take up the challenge, albeit from the slightly awkward starting point of Richmond. Fortunately, we realised we'd already been to one 
	at midnight, in Stratford! The others were lightweights! Ad Ikea! Adkea!

	In the name of efficiency, we immediately turned on our heel and went back to Willesden Junction. Now, as we were clearly so awesome at this challenge, having 
	visited 1 our of n Ikeas by 15:00, we decided to take a (¬) quick detour, taking the Bakerloo to the end. This line was a bit strange, as we had to stop at 
	some random shitty (very Valleys-y) station in the middle of nowhere, with collapsing shelters and a strong smell of <s>canabis</s>>piss, just to continue to the end of the 
	line! Jumping on and off also nearly incurred the anger of some dodgy geezers sitting in the same rumbling carriage as us, as we run about the various 
	shitty stops on the line, it was at this point they brandished their knives. To try and mitigate the issue, Matthew offered to jump on and off for a few stations, and was in charge of photos with his 
	magnificent phone camera. The below 4K photo at is an example of his handicraft. We disembarked at Harrow and Wealdstone, and set 
	about walking through and getting lost in dodgy cul-de-sacs in Harrow. We trekked along the main road towards the town centre, whilst we admired the general 
	run-down nature of the area, and read up about the recent shootings and stabbings. Noice. Perhaps this wasn't too different to normal at all! It felt just 
	like the valleys, NT's spiritual home! 
</p>
	<center><img src="../resources/photos/Harrow & Wealdstone.jpg" width="55%"></center><br>
<p>
	Despite the local presitigious public school, this by no means dampened the Merthyr-esque ethos, nor our undying snobbery and disdain. After a brief detour 
	complaining about the prevalence of fast food chains (despite that conversation starting off with Matthew mentioning he had never before seen a Taco Bell, 
	like the one we passed in Harrow), we quickly found our way to the arse end of the town, stumbling across what was clearly a brothel. It may have said "nail 
	bar" or something or other, but we weren't fooled! We could clearly see, thanks to the ubiquitous gold glitter paint and streamers (as well as the dodgy, 
	shabby-looking backrooms), that this was absolutely a brothel. It also didn't help the case that theere was the tube running under it, for easy escape. We truly have a habit for bringing out the best in places!
	<br><br>
	We briefly got lost trying to navigate around 3 houses, and got slightly distracted by some company plagiarising the clearly-trademarked MLC<sup>TM</sup>, 
	we finally reached Harrow-on-the-Hill station (which was set deep into a cutting, ironically), and waited on the island platform for yet another trip on the 
	Met! We caught the Met to King's Cross, luxuriating in the (rare) non-side seats, before we approached Neasden, the site of Ikea 2. Now, technically, the 
	Ikea challenge required us to visit <emph>every<emph> Ikea, but Matthew moaned about this, saying that it was rather hard and awkward to walk to Neasden Ikea - 
	it wasn't really designed for public transport access after all. He proposed that as the tube line passed kind of close to the Ikea, we could say we visited 
	it... at high speed! And so it was. Passing Ikea at 60mph, we now had 2 Ikeas under our belt! Tick!

	We did however, notice that the other participants were purchasing what appeared to be random crap in each Ikea, so to make up for our... interesting visit 
	to Neasden, we resolved to get extra random crap at Meridian Water. The Met plunged underground before Baker Street, whereupon we continued subsurface until 
	King's Cross. We eventually snaked our way across the mammoth station, learning from our mistakes in Koppa 1, before hopping onto the Piccadilly line, trying 
	to avoid the rabid Arsenal fans, and continuing our routine of jumping on and off at every station, now perfected to an art of attempting to not incur the 
	misanthropic wrath of the Londoners.
	<br><br>
	We passed KBuzz's home station, Caledonian Road, and continued on the Piccadilly to Finsbury Park, before switching to the Victoria for the first time 
	for some high-frequency nuttiness. We flew up the line in no time at all (passing the station we actually needed), all the way to the end at Walthamstow 
	Central. A station that was barren but neither of us felt safe in.

	We then doubled back to Tottenham Hale to catch an NR service to Meridian Premier IKEA Extra station. The tube was quick, and after a little confusion 
	regarding the detour signs outside the station, we arrived at the NR station, eagerly awaiting our train. We were going rogue - off the tube map! How 
	exciting! The Greater Anglia service was absolutely empty, and we had <strong>3 carriages</strong> to ourselves! We alighted only 2 stops later, at the 
	UK's newest station, and my word it was rewarding. The station building was beautiful, careening out over the platforms below. The stair/lift patterns were 
	admittedly confusing to Matthew, the CCTV cameras were very numerous (although the bin bags were satisfying), and the old station platforms were still very 
	obviously visible, only 50 yards down the track, but all of that was redeemed by the massive maps they had out the front - Neath and Camborne were on there!!
	<br><br>
	We descended the long staircases to the pavement facing the road out of London, and decided that our best course of action was to simply leg it across the 
	dual carriageway. Health and Safety is very important to us at NT, so always wear a helmet when not looking for oncoming traffic when sprinting across a 
	dual carriageway and screaming 'run me over 'en'. Leave the unhelmeted IPN activity to the professionals! Running across the road was definitely worth it though, as we were greeted by not 
	only our IKEA, but also a Premier Inn, <i>and</i> a Tesco Extra! Gordon Bennett, this was a true slice of God's Country outside of Kernow! We thereby 
	baptised this heavenly station 'Meridian Premier IKEA Extra station'. Amen.

	We made our way up the glorious escalator into Ikea, and began our Spinz i Ikeas! We wandered around all the showrooms, admiring the furniture as night fell 
	in. James took a photo of Matthew striking a Blofeld pose in an armchair, whilst Matthew snapped James looking insane, sitting at a desk! We looked at a 
	load of random crap on that floor, before having meatballs in the restaurant, a must-have on any self-respecting IKEA trip. Matthew was even persuaded to

	We then headed downstairs to the markethall, and bought a tinsel Christmas tree, a tealight holder, a tin can (which now holds loads of stuff James never ues)
	and a light bulb, many of which came from Ikea's golden section: the bargain corner! Pleased with our magnificent haul of crap, and knowing that our fellow 
	Ikea challengers would be similarly impressed, we set off, back across the road, and then headed to the station... only to miss the train.
	<br><br>
	By a long way. The next train was in an hour. "You miserable excuse for a railway!" screamed Matthew. We did, however, take this photo. Admire the possibly

	This was a problem. Not only was James trapped with a very impatient Matthew, unused to waiting more than 5 minutes at this time of night for a tube, but 
	we had tweeted that we would arrive at the IKEA challenge rendevous in central London shortly... and would squeeze in a whole other Ikea. Also, it was 
	freezing cold. A nice touch. Thinking fast, we caught some random dodgy bus from outside Ikea towards the city, thinking that we'd quickly identify the 
	nearest station, and that we'd hardly lose any time at all. Oh, how wrong were we?

	The bus wound its way through various streets in stabby city, taking more than its fair share of time to do so, and quickly eating into our alloted 
	amount of time to get to Ikea and back, whilst we earnestly consulted our telescreens as to where we were meant to alight the bus. 
	James claimed we should alight at stop n, whereas Matthew thought we should get off at stop n+1. The moment the bus passed stop n, we realised 
	that James had been right, and that we ought to have alighted there. The bus ground its way through the traffic to the next stop, at which point 
	we threw ourselves off the bus and sprinted down the street, in and out of numerous crowds who all gave us accusatory stares, laughing maniacally and 
	trying desperately not to get stabbed! Roads, cars, traffic? if you run fast you can't get mowed down. This was pure, unadulterated madness! We had no idea where we were, only that this was the stabbing capital of 
	London, we had a tin can and a christmas tree in our arms, and that we were late for our train!

	We eventually reached the slowverground, ran up the stairs to the platform, clutching our selection of crap, only to find that we had completely 
	missed the platform gateline, had to run back down the stairs, tap in, run back up and catch the train. We took the Lea line one stop to Seven 
	Sisters on a small crammed crappy train, much alike to a trip up the valleys on a sprinter, before descending underground to the Victoria line. We took the line all the way to Stockwell, the penultimate 
	stop. The line was very pleasant until about King's Cross, when seemingly hundreds of people crammed themselves into the already claustrophobic 
	carriage. Squeezed in, pressed face-to-face, James got chocked. The congestion eventually eased at Green Park and Victoria, and by Stockwell, 
	it was almost pleasant again. 
	<br><br>
	We changed to the Northern line in our quest to reach Croydon and get back by half 7, when James dropped the bombshell that all the other teams 
	had been in Central London, in a bar, since half 5... when we'd set off. Whether James had previously withheld this information or whether Matthew 
	just failed to listen (more likely the latter), this immediately threw all our plans into the air. We were already on the rickety clattering train 
	heading south, so we went one stop south, alighted at Clapham North, in the strange station with a single island platform, and immediately saw a 
	conveniently placed Ikea advert! Seeing this as a suitable substitute for an Ikea visit, we ticked off our 4th Ikea of the day, rounded the total number 
	up to the full 5, and got on the Northbound train, waiting to share the fruits of our success with our fellow challengers. 
	<br><br>
	On the northbound northern line, we retreated back to Kennington, then up to Leicester Square. James got chocked again in Covent Garden on the Piccadilly, 
	which was another absolutely rammed train, then alighted at Holborn, before absolutely legging it down the street, searching left and right for the pub 
	they'd singled out on Twitter. We went in, despite Matthew's apprehensions, and found the rest of the participants in the Ikea challenge, all gathered round, 
	talking about their day's exploits. James decided to approach them:

	James: Hello, are you the #IKEAmeansIKEA challenge people?<br>
	Hugo: Yes, yes we are!<br>
	James: Ah, brilliant! We are Team Nutty Trains and we've been doing the challenge too, even though we started a little late! <br>
	(Matthew puts his head into his hands) <br>
	Hugo: Really? Have you been to all 5 Ikeas? <br>
	James: Err... Yes? 5? <br>
	Hugo: Yes, 5. Ikea says it has 5 London Ikeas. <br>
	James: Ah, well, we went to Neasden, Meridian Water,...<br>
	Matthew: (Croydon and Greenwich) <br>
	James: ...Croydon, Greenwich and Stratford. <br>
	Hugo: Stratford doesn't count. <br>
	James: Really? Where is the 5th one? <br>
	Hugo: Lakeside. <br>
	Matthew: Ah, we didn't do Lakeside because it isn't technically in Greater London. <br>
	Hugo:, True, but we went off Ikea's list, and they list it as a London Ikea, so we went with that. <br>
	Matthew: Ah, fair. <br>
	James: We did get plenty of random crap though! (Moves to pull said random crap out of his bag) <br>
	Hugo: Did you follow the checklist? <br>
	James: Checklist? What checklist? <br>
	Hugo: The checklist of tasks you had to complete at each Ikea...
	<br><br>
	After a few of them read out the tasks and it became increasingly apparent that not only had we not followed the tasks, nor had any idea of the existence 
	of such a list, but that we had treated the entire thing as a joke and done our own thing, they quickly lost interest and ignored us, despite our  
	enviable selection of random crap from Meridian Premier Ikea Extra that we'd bought, merely because it wasn't on the prescribed list of crap to buy. 
	How would that be any fun if the crap wasn't sufficiently random? Also, we apparently hadn't been to all the Ikeas. Oops. Humilated, we left whilst no-one 
	was looking, thoroughly dejected. (They weren't real train nutters anyways. Most of them were spotters. *spews*) 
	<br><br>
	Taking a "short walk" (If Matthew takes me on another short fucking walk I swear to fucking god) to McDonalds, (crossing Holborn Bridge along the way, where 
	James posed, stroking the ornamental dragons), we bitched for a bit about how boring a pre-defined list of objectives was boring (as if we hadn't done the same), 
	and how it wasn't nutty enough for us. In doing so, we came up with our <i>own</i> Ikea challenge, visiting every Ikea in the UK! Ha! Beat that!
	<br><br>
	<strong> Ikea Challenge: coming to a Swedish furniture store near you... after chocky time</strong>
	<br><br>
	In McDonald's, we had food, sat and talked for a bit, then went to Bank, where we regained all of our nuttiness, at unheard of levels, running through 
	the entire labyrithine station, up and down and left and right, sprinting down escalators, trying to race one another (including Matthew pushing James 
	over in a desperate attempt to beat him), before waiting in Monument for an age. Finally, as it was very late and we'd been on the go for over 12 hours, 
	we took the District to Gloucester Road, the Circle to Notting Hill Gate, and the Central line home. Onto day 3!

	James arrived at Matthew's flat just before 11, and they decided what they were going to do for the day. James needed a gift for one of the many women that
	have left him in a worse state than they joined him (go die in a hole all of you if you are reading this, unless you were remotely nice to me.). Hence he 
	suggested Kew Gardens, however Matthew fancied Greenwich Observatory. We couldnt decide on one and with limied time, we decided that it was an amazing idea to 
	go for both. Matthew, however remembered that James had a train to catch back to Gods Country, so he made him sign a little contract. After the legal proceedings
	had ended we headed to Shepherd's Bush, changed to the Slowverground (which brought back memories of Koppa 1), southbound this time, to Clapham Junction (admiring the maps 
	whilst James made a little Chinese lady feel awfully guilty for existing (她很不有意思和不太大了)), before reaching the Slowverground's mid-circle terminus. Against Matthew's tube 
	loyalty, we then switched to the NR platforms and took an SWR service to Richmond, because the District and Piccadilly lines were shut, and the Slowverground 
	to Richmond had carked it (the tube had really let us down that day, considering that we'd been to Richmond the day before). The NR train was a really 
	surreal experience for Matthew, despite having only been back in London for a month. The traditional carriage arrangement seemed weird, the announcers were 
	unfamiliar and just the entire setup seemed wrong to a tube addict like Matthew! The train was weird for James too, as it was missing stations, weird not 
	only from an NT point of view, but also from him being used to pacers in Kernow stopping at every miserable halt with 2 cows and a sheep to its name!

	Once at Richmond, the extent of the devastation on the tube network became apparent - literally nothing was operating. It seemed as if the buses refused to 
	operate either, as we ended up walking to Kew Gardens before a bus passed us to take us there, despite the journey of over a mile. James went into the 
	gardens, intending to visit the gift shop (but having to pay the entrance fee), and consequently took his time, having a good wander around, whilst Matthew  
	had re-entered full cheapskate mode, so despite wanting to visit the gardens, refused to pay the entrance fee, and instead left James to it. Matthew 
	wandered down into Kew, passing a Sunday trader's market (feeling thoroughly out of place amongst the artisan sellers), befored heading down to the Thames, 
	feeling very sorry for himself, having been divorced from his problem sheets for almost 48 hours. Safe to say, Matthew wasn't in a great mood that day. James 
	on the other hand, had a fantastic time in Kew (it probably reminded him very much of the Eden Project, albeit with a pagoda in the corner, although he never saw it), so I shall leave 
	him write up about his time there in future:<br><br>
	Hello Future, it future past James here from the present to talk about the past in the future, which is actually the present for me. Past James went to Kew Gardens, to buy
	a gift for one of the past women who left him, future James is very bitter about this fact and hates them all. They are referred to as the bitch n, where $n\in \N$. He got a 
	lovely purple bubbly necklace that she didn't deserve, bitch. He then wandered around the gardens, quickly as he didn't want to keep Matthew waiting. So he went to see the glasshouse
	and jumped around inside. He made friends with some ducks and some swans and returned to see Matthew. He texted Matthew to let him know he was waiting. He sat there on the outside wondering
	why Matthew hadn't replied. So James called Matthew,
</p>
	<blockquote> Ding, aling, Ding, aling</blockquote>
<p>
	Shit. I had no idea how to contact Matthew. I just had to wait, and waited I did. It was 30 minutes until Matthew came sauntering around the corner. I could have walked around more :(

	At quarter to 2, we met up outside the entrance, and took the bus towards Ealing, but it was so, so painfully slow that we decided to take matters into 
	our own hands as we crawled over the Thames in a massive queue (including numerous northbound busses, back-to-back), 
	and jumped off, walking over the bridge to Matthew's home turf, north of the river, before running down to Kew Bridge station to check for any phantom 
	trains. Disappointed (and with a rather agitated Matthew, worried sick that James would miss his train), we walked towards Chiswick Roundabout, and caught 
	a second bus took the bus to Gunnersbury, before then checking on the trains get again. This time, hallelujah, the slowverground was running, so we 
	slowvergrounded it to Acton Central, and finally bussed it to North Acton. 
	<br><br>
	We picked up all of James's stuff from Matthew's room, before we headed to Notting Hill Gate, eating crisps on the way, and James picked up his pre-ordered 
	Pizza Express (and Matthew sneaked a slice, after being too miserly to pay for his own). Needing to get his frustration out of his system, when carrying 
	James's bag down the stairs, Matthew thwacked some annoying kid in the head with the heavy bag, causing James to double up with laughter. Pleased with our 
	messed up and insane end to the day, we then headed to Paddington via Bayswater, ticking off one final station in our adventure. We walked over to collect 
	James's tickets from the exact spot in that station that the woman had been detained with suspected coronavirus, meaning that James got chocked as he boarded 
	his train back to Kernow, completing our longest ever adventure, and our last for 6 months!
