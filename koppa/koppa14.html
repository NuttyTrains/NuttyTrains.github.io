    James and Matthew head east to find the grimmest places in the entirety of London. You like industrial estates, council flats and concrete? You've come to 
    the right place!

    <strong>WELCOME BACK TO THE AMNESIA ZONE!</strong>
    <br><br>
    Join Matthew on the 5th installment of his archaeological dig as we approach the event horizon of the the traumas of 2022/23. This is an adventure that 
    we do remember well, but not for any good reasons - this was quite possibly the most miserable adventure in NT history. This adventure would have been 
    preserved for posterity, had we not hated it so much, and had Matthew not imminently had an even worse subsequent few days...

    I am pretty sure that we headed straight over to Liverpool St and went straight for the Lizzie line. I think this is where we met, given that I am pretty sure 
    that the first shot of the video will be James standing in front of the City skyscrapers, and me saying <strong>"Welcome to 9/11!"</strong>. Today, we were 
    going to finish the Lizzie line (in the east). The central section had been so nice - surely the rest must be too!

    No. James was wrong. Very wrong. Matthew had never taken James to East London for very long for a reason...

    The less said about this section, the better. The stations were okay (and had been nicely renovated), but they were not great. James had hoped that Shenfield would 
    be some nice quaint terminus, like Chesham, and was astonished and disappointed to find out that Shenfield is in fact situated in an industrial estate on the 
    outskirts of Brentwood. This was but a taste of things to come.
