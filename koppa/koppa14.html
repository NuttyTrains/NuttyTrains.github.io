    James and Matthew head east to find the grimmest places in the entirety of London. You like industrial estates, council flats and concrete? You've come to 
    the right place!

    <strong>WELCOME BACK TO THE AMNESIA ZONE!</strong>
    <br><br>
    Join Matthew on the 5th installment of his archaeological dig as we approach the event horizon of the traumas of 2022/23. This is an adventure that 
    we do remember well, but not for any good reasons - this was quite possibly the most miserable adventure in NT history. This adventure would have been 
    preserved for posterity, had we not hated it so much, and had Matthew not imminently had an even worse subsequent few days...

So get on the bakerloo at 9 and you should be there for 11

    I am pretty sure that we headed straight over to Liverpool St and went straight for the Lizzie line. I think this is where we met, given that I am pretty sure 
    that the first shot of the video will be James standing in front of the City skyscrapers, and me saying <strong>"Welcome to 9/11!"</strong>. Today, we were 
    going to head east and finish the eastern Lizzie line (see the below map for why). The central section had been so nice - surely the rest must be too!

    No. James was wrong. Very wrong. Matthew had never taken James to East London for very long for a reason...
    <br><br>
    The less said about this section, the better. The stations were okay (and had been nicely renovated), but they were not great. James had hoped that Shenfield would 
    be some nice quaint terminus, like Chesham, and was astonished and disappointed to find out that Shenfield is in fact situated in an industrial estate on the 
    outskirts of Brentwood. This was but a taste of things to come.

    We reversed back down the line, unimpressed, and disembarked before sprinting through Romford station all the way to the overground platform (which is really, 
    really far away and awkward to get to, but we made it). This is the weird Overground line (now called the Liberty line) - it only has 3 stations and 2 trains 
    an hour (it makes sense why Emerson Park is one of the least-used stations in London). It is actually quite a nice, pleasant line - very peaceful and wooded. 
    True to form, Emerson Park was very quiet. I think we have footage of this - somewhere.
    <br><br>
    At Upminster, we reversed yet again, down the line (not sure which line) back to Barking. Back in 2022, this was still the terminus of the GOBLIN - the next item 
    on the NT menu: it was Hilary time.
    <br><br>
    Now we had boarded the Goblin, thinking it would be a funny and cool line. It was not. Usually the overground is okay - quite shitty but equally quite funny. We 
    were headed through shitty places, but familiar shitty places (to Matthew), which made it tolerable. This was the equivalent of the wild west (east?) to us. We 
    did not really know where we were going, we weren't from the area, and for once, <i>everyone knew</i>. We had never received such looks on NT since the days of 
    the angry conductor, or the Sampi adventures. It was pretty disconcerting, to be quite honest. The cameras went away, and we mutually agreed to get the fuck off 
    that train. The Goblin could wait; this wasn't fun anymore.
    <br><br>
    In 2024, with all the wisdom and sagacity we have since accumulated, we would have completely reset the adventure at this point. We'd have gone off on a jolly 
    on c2c or something - fuck East London. But no, this was 2022. Matthew was on a mission to tick off this section of the map, and so that is precisely what we 
    did. It was back onto the slowverground, except this time on a new line - off to Cheshunt!
    <br><br>
    The line to Cheshunt was better, but 'better' is a relative term - it still wasn't great. Perhaps it was slightly better purely because it was slightly more 
    familiar (we had started this line, and been to Cheshunt before), and this makes a really big difference on NT - we like our familiar territory! It makes 
    ticking things off far more meaningful when you understand where you are... (Oh and Turkey St was a funny name - got to shout that one out). Cheshunt was okay. 
    We saw the location of the overground crash (the barrier was still fucked).

    We reversed down the line and headed to Enfield Town, which was decidedly less fun. At this point, the prospect of reversing all the way down the line to 
    Liverpool St was quite frankly too much to bear. Instead, we decided to do something crazy... why not just head out of London on the other Enfield line? We have 
    been to lots and lots of horrible 50s council estates - why not go to an iconic one? Why not head to <i>Stevenage</i>?
    <br><br>
    Enfield was actually nicer than we thought, on our brief 5 minute visit as we marched from Enfield Town to Enfield Chase. I think that I ended up running to 
    Enfield Chase, because I distinctly remember buying both tickets myself (and getting slightly lost) - this was a pretty tight connection, but we were still 
    young and spritely enough to actually make it! It was off up the line to Stevenage!

Fucking hell Stevenage was grim
</div>
<p>
    Stevenage... was a place. A place of all time. The station is connected to one of the largest blocks of concrete we had ever seen, via a pedestrian tunnel/bridge 
    to the town centre - one of the largest expanses of concrete we had ever seen. It was under construction at the time, which made the whole place look like a bomb 
    site. More-or-less every single shop was either shuttered or shattered, and gangs of yobs were hanging around at every street corner, terrorising those who walked 
    past. It was truly a location fit for NT. In some ways, it was a little sad: clearly it had been planned nicely, it just didn't turn out well (like this adventure). 
    I'll let the video speak for itself, so you can see Stevenage in its full glory.
    <br><br>
    It was back down the mainline for us, to Finsbury Park, onto the Victoria line, and back onto national rail for one last jolly. Yes, this was to tick off 2 more 
    challenging stations... but this was meant to be a fun treat for us! It was time to take the Eurostar!!
    <br><br>
    We walked from Stratford to Stratford "International", just like we had done many times before, and descended into the enormous concrete cavern underneath the 
    shopping centre. This station is truly, truly massive. Abnormally so. If any non-James/Matthew readers are actually reading this - you honestly need to see 
    this station if nothing else. It is astonishing <s>(an astonishing waste of money)</s> It is also not particularly "international", given that no international 
    train has ever (or will ever) call there. But illi vitae - high speed trains to Kent <i>do</i> call here, and after a hard day in 'ends', we deserved this treat. 
    <br><br>
    Needless to say, the Javelin high speed train was pretty awesome. It was quiet, fast and comfortable. The juxtaposition between this and the rest of the day 
    was stark. For many years at NT, we have maintained that we should take slow, stopping services to tick off every station at first, and then eventually head 
    out further and further on faster and faster trains, expanding our range. But why were we still doing this? These crappy stations are... crap. Why not go 
    further afield now? Why not cut the crap and go to cool, far-flung places? We had kind of ticked off most of our familiar stations by this point in Wales, 
    London, Oxford and the South West - surely now, as we entered our masters degrees, it was time to <i>graduate</i> to high-speed travel to cool destinations? 
    2022 Matthew put it in much angrier terms than I, but this was food for thought. Look at our list of adventures, and you'll see that many of our subsequent 
    adventures were exactly that - further afield or abroad. We had caught the high-speed bug, and decided we wanted to see cool places, not more council estates. 
    Stick around to see what happens next: NT changes, and becomes a lot more interesting... Fuck London: NT will be off to Europe soon!
