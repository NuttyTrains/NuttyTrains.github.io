Tis the night before NT, all the batteries are charging and we have no idea where we are going

    The day begins with Matthew outside his natural habitat: awake in the morning. Very early in the morning. 5:30am, to be exact. 
    He was catching a 7am train to Sheffield, much to his chagrin. At last, he was experiencing the lengths that James used to go 
    to for Koppa and for Kontent...
    <br><br>
    The plan was to catch a short train to Sheffield, followed by a long winding train via Derby and Birmingham to Oxford, which 
    was about as long and miserable as it sounds (although Matthew is currently sat on the floor of an EMR train in Chesterfield, 
    en route to Koppa 18, so past Matthew could have had it <i>much, much</i> worse). It turns out, dear viewers, that it is actually 
    very hard (and slow) to travel in this country when you aren't going via London! En route, we started to plan. The weather looked 
    horrible enough to ruin our original Digamma 4 plans (tune in later!) so instead we decided to revisit London for the first time in 
    almost 2 years - it was time for a Koppa!

I am passing some enormous building sites, where the ground has been levelled. It is nice to see that they are finally doing the humane thing 
and flattening Birmingham

<p>
    Eventually, Matthew showed up in Oxford, and returned to Teddy Hall, where it was birthday present unboxing time! Chateau de Xi for James, and 
    'Pouilly-sur-Loire' for Matthew.. which looked terribly red for a Loire white... This clip should be amazing when it finally releases in 2029...

    In earnest, the day began as we headed to Reading, then changed to our Gatwick train. We were going the whole way... not realising 
    that this train skipped stations. RIP. Classic NT. Nevertheless, these were our first stations of 2024, so we at least achieved 
    <i>something</i>.

<p>
    To maximise our station hit-rate, we changed at the glorious city of Guildford, home to cultural icons such as Popworld, McDonalds 
    and <i>the Bridge of Sighs</i>. Truly a city of all time. Then it was back on the train to Gatwick. Along the route, we made many stops 
    in some stations neither you nor I care about, but we also made many visits to the SHNACK ZONE<sup>TM</sup>. This is 
    legally-distinct, completely novel IP that belongs to NT and is not derivative in any way of any other travel-based comedy series 
    on Youtube. <strong>The H makes it legally-distinct!</strong>
    <br><br>
    We spent a good half an hour attempting to break into Gatwick. We rode the shuttle to the North terminal, we rode the shuttle to the 
    South terminal, we attempted in vain to access duty-free - good shit. Alas, we were unable to escape the misery of the UK on this 
    adventure, because we couldn't even see a screen with all our potential destinations. 0/5 would not recommend.

    After a brief fiasco due to cancelled and missed trains, we wound up in Redhill, where we attempted to make our famous -1 minute 
    connection, forgetting that we are now old and decrepit, and cannot do this like we used to. Being 22/23 is fun! Instead, we headed 
    to the nearest food truck, because it was James' feeding time. They claimed that this phenomenon is known as 'lunch'? I could have 
    sworn that they had already eaten that day, but they insisted that humans apparently need more than 1 meal a day. Not sure about that 
    one - further observations of human behaviour are needed to verify this bold claim.

    <br><br>
    Soon we wound up in our most favourite place - Croydon. It was good to be back. Now last time we had been here, it was our first 
    ever tram experience, and Matthew was not impressed. Too much like a bus. <i>Since then</i>, we had been to actually nice places 
    with really nice tram networks - Paris, Bordeaux, Nantes etc. Consequently, Matthew had learned to appreciate trams... and James 
    had learned that the Croydon tram was not some really cool marvel, it was in fact the most horrid and miserable tram in existence. 
    How they were unhappy with shirtless hooligans wandering in the very narrow streets, blocking the tram, I don't know.
    <br><br>
    When we arrived at West Croydon, some other hooligan was blasting a bass beat from his car, so loud and so deep that it made 
    everything in Croydon resonate - the windows, the council flats, and my own cardiovascular system (ow). We couldn't wait to 
    escape and never come back.
    <br><br>
    After ticking off the slowverground line out of Croydon, we had a long walk through glorious South London (near Telegraph Hill, 
    which exhibits some... interesting stratification), before bouncing around South/Southeastern stochastically for a while, ticking 
    off an astonishing amount of a horrific knot of lines. We penetrated quite far into the southeast, where James approved of the 
    greenery (coming soon, Koppa 2x). On our return to Brixton, we decided to do one last out-and-back to Sutton. James agreed to 
    this plan after being <s>drugged</s> caffeinated by Matthew. James only agreed to this plan because Matthew omitted the key detail 
    that this plan involved a change at Streatham. Those were the most tense 5 minutes of our lives, but we survived with only slight 
    mental scarring, rather than the physical scarring James' mum had expected!
    <br><br>
    In the evening we then headed to Bancone near London Bridge, which was really nice. 5/5 would recommend. After this, we headed back 
    towards Paddington, and discovered that for the first time in years, the hoardings around PAD had disappeared - Paddington Square 
    is finally open! This was pretty monumental for both of us, given that we have used PAD so much over the years, yet had never seen 
    this part of the station properly. It almost brought a tear to Matthew's eye when he realised how infrequently he visits 
    Paddington nowadays, compared to how central it used to be to him. Time marches on, I suppose.
    <br><br>
    Obviously, the solution to this is more Koppas - read on below to see what subsequent scarring Matthew inflicted upon James' lungs!
