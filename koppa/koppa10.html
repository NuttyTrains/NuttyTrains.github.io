	This is an extremely belated description because I have been dying, but this was a really fun adventure, and our first ever disjointed adventure. We met up on 
	the Thursday in Paddington bike park, where Matthew was wrestling with his bike, looking far worse for wear after being abused for months, riding back and forth 
	to Imperial each night. But apart from that, it was business as usual - off to the Bakerloo line, genbatte! We got on the shitty, rickety train and headed straight 
	for Oxford Circus, where Matthew guessed the doors perfectly (I still haven't lost it!), and we went to Matthew's old haunt, the central line. 
	<br><br>
	James: I have missed this. I have missed London.<br>
	Matthew: Really?<br>
	James: *hacks up half a lung* No, not really *pained smile*
	<br><br>
	We had a nice walk from St Pauls through the City, thought about mimicking Geoff's recent Bank video, but instead headed straight for the goal: <s>City Thameslink</s> 
	lunch. Matthew had some shitty vegetarian shit and spent the rest of KX.ε complaining. James told him to eat meat or shut up. Matthew shut up.
	<br><br>
	City Thameslink? More like Shitty Thameslink. This was the single ugliest station we had ever seen on NT, and we have seen some stinkers. The 1980s had called at the 
	station, and they wanted their Network SouthEast branding back. It was fucking disgusting. The escalators were broken too. Mmmm, we at NT love screaming escalators. 
	They remind us of pacers. Resquiscat in Pace.
	<br><br>
	The platforms were cool though. They were completely nutty, filled the entire length of the tunnel, and were sharply sloped at either end. We had never seen anything 
	like it! Is this what Crossrail will look like? We hope so. We want dodgy sloping platforms! After 3 years at Penryn, James cannot tolerate straightness of any form!

	Nevertheless, we had finally ticked this annoying station off! We boarded the train and set off... and that was it. 1 stop later, Matthew bailed at Farringdon, and 
	James continued all the way to Cambridge. KX.ε, the shortest adventure ever, lasting less than an hour, was already complete.
	<br><br>
	That's all folks!

	It was back to NT on the Sunday. We had plenty of plans. Reality had something to say about those plans, as did James' luggage and stomach, but illi vitae. We 
	decided to meet in Hatfield to allow Matthew his once-per-2-month breath of fresh air outside the M25, and so that we could tick off every remaining station 
	on the line to Cambridge. This involved both of us catching trains before 9am, which was a bit of a shock to the system to say the least... especially when 
	Matthew managed to head to the wrong terminus (Moorgate) and catch completely the wrong train. Round of applause Matthew. Round of applause. Matthew was rewarded 
	with a glorious view of <i>nothing</i> as me made his way through the tunnel. Yummy darkness. Much better than James' view of rolling fields and greenery.
	<br><br>
	Matthew arrived in Hatfield about 20 minutes before James. He had a bit of a wander, saw some stuff (which looked alright), and avoided the concrete monstrosities 
	that lay on the opposite side of the track. James arrived, we complained a bit about how grim the stations in the South East are, before boarding the train. 
	Matthew's breath of fresh air was over. No more green for Matthew. It was back to the big smoke for him!

	You could hear James sigh as London appeared on the horizon. Then you could hear him complain. Then you could hear him get angry that the lovely greenery had given 
	way to endless houses. But Matthew couldn't hear any of that. Matthew was glad to be back in the metropolis, away from the scary backward provinces and their oxygen.
	<br><br>
	We started off by heading down the Ally Pally branch, but unfortunately missing Ally Pally itself. James had not factored in that Ally Pally is in fact on top of 
	a hill, and that he was carrying 3 tonnes of luggage with him. Hence we zoomed past, watching it recede into the distance behind us. Before long, everything 
	started to recede into the distance as we descended into the tunnels of the Northern City line, and went back in the time machine to 1987. Welcome back to Network 
	SouthEast!
	<br><br>
	To be honest, the line was quite cool, despite being ancient, rundown and decrepit. Then again, we love all places like that, so this got the NT stamp of approval. 
	We ticked off yet another terminus (Moorgate), and moved on - we had a train to catch*!
	<br><br>
	We took the H&C from Moorgate to West Ham, and then ran for the Jubilee line, missing it by seconds because of some slow people. *Spits* slow people - should be shot! 
	We waited for the next one, took it 1 stop to Canning Town, and changed yet again, this time to our old friend, the DLR. We rode it to Custom House, where something 
	special was waiting for us... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Crossrail</a>! It had arrived!
	<br><br>
	Now comes the part of the adventure where I am sorry to say that we both went full train-nutter. Well, mostly James. As the author of this account, I am blaming him 
	for all the mistakes that were made here. We are truly sorry for this. We have broken the NT code of conduct. Please accept our humble clickbait when it comes out, 
	complete with exclusive shots of purp trains and James' arse. Geoff might be able to give you the former, but only NT can provide the latter. You know which one you 
	really want to see ;)
	<br><br>
	<i><strong>Message for Matthew in 2026: INSERT CLICKBAIT HERE</strong></i>
	<br><br>
	We were meant to see multiple Crossrail trains that morning. We had planned it perfectly. Yet it was not to be. The first one we saw was the last one that day, 
	because 10 minutes after passing us, it broke down. RIP 1st half of 2022!
	<br><br>
	Autism satisfied, James now turned to the next most pressing concern - food. As the shithole that is Custom House held nothing edible, we instead returned to the 
	DLR, headed back to Canning Town, crossed the sludge-filled River Lea, and went to the odd peninsula called City Island, with its candy-coloured towers. What an odd 
	place. We had something to eat there, Matthew lost all feeling in his fingers, and we returned to the station, and headed once more to West Ham. Here, we caught c2c, 
	the famous train provider that goes all across the country from Cornwall to Glasgow, and headed into Fenchurch St, ticking off another terminus (and a Monopoly 
	station too!)

	Fenchurch Street was cool. It also seemed to want to smother Tower Gateway at the end (Tower Gateway was almost underNEATH the end of the platform). That was a thing. 
	The outside looked very cool though. NT is definitely looking forward to returning here for when we have our seaside holiday to Southend!
	<br><br>
	Clarification: NT is not looking forward to returning here. NT does not endorse any association with Essex. NT spits on Essex.
	<br><br>
	At long last, James' arms could rejoice, as we were finally on our way to Ealing Premier Inn (again). At long last, he no longer had to die. When we arrived, we fucked 
	about with the dodgy lift, James choked on the hard water and complained about the <s>mud</s> coffee he had been served, Gareth made his first appearance on video 
	(Gareth later enjoyed some healthy cannibalism when he ate that particular clip), and we took some sexy pin-up shots of James for our video thumbnail. That'll get us 
	1000s of views. We really spoil you, "valued" viewers. First you get to see James' crack, and now you get some sexy pin-up shots. We are going to have to start putting 
	some of this stuff behind paywalls if you don't show more gratitude. If NT OnlyFans becomes a thing, you only have yourselves to blame!

	We took the Picc up from North Ealing to Uxbridge, finally completing the tube* at last, and were greeted by classical music in the sodium glow of the station. What an end.
	<br><br>
	We caught the Met back to Rayners Lane, and after spending a while questioning our plans, getting lost in Sudbury Hill, and finding that trains don't stop Sudbury Hill 
	and Harrow Sundays, we headed to Harrow-on-the-hill (sigh), bought a TfL ticket out of London (it was pink!), and took the Chiltern Line all the way to Aylesbury 
	Vale Parkway, and went to Spoons in Aylesbury. It was quite nice actually. We took the other Chiltern line back to Marylebone, conning our way out of the ticket 
	barriers, before heading back to Ealing. Matthew then made it to White City before the tube gave up on him, and he took a bus home (shudders).
	<br><br>
	All in all, the big 1-0 didn't disappoint. We got a surprising amount done, finished the tube*, went on a jolly outside the M25, and yet still felt alive by the end. 
	Onto Koppa 11, where we move onto finishing off the rest of London - woo!
