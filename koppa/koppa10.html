	Coming soon to an omicron cluster near you; the big 1-0, it is Koppa X time! Catch it soon in 2022! (The adventure, not the chock)

	<strong> The crackheads of Sudbury Town <br>
	Every adventure is a helth adventure <br>
	They disable the Exeter Learning environment for an hour at lunchtime <br>
	It's 1984 - it's real, I'm telling you!</strong>
	<br><br>
	This is an extremely belated description because I have been dying, but this was a really fun adventure, and our first ever disjointed adventure. The 
	first section was extremely short - we met in PAD, went to City Thameslink, ticked it off, and that was that.
	<br><br>
	For the bulk of the adventure, we met up in Hatfield in the morning, headed into London via the Northern City line, before making our way across to Canning Town 
	and Custom House to see the Lizzie Line trains (they broke down - RIP). We had lunch on City Island, took c2c to Fenchurch Street and then went to Ealing Premier 
	Inn again. We took the Picc up from North Ealing to Uxbridge, finally completing the tube* at last, and were greeted by classical music in the sodium glow of the 
	station. What an end.
	<br><br>
	We caught the Met back to Rayners Lane, and after spending a while questioning our plans, getting lost in Sudbury Hill, and finding that trains don't stop Sudbury Hill 
	and Harrow Sundays, we headed to Harrow-on-the-hill (sigh), bought a TfL ticket out of London (it was pink!), and took the Chiltern Line all the way to Aylesbury 
	Vale Parkway, and went to Spoons in Aylesbury. It was quite nice actually. We took the other Chiltern line back to Marylebone, conning our way out of the ticket 
	barriers, before heading back to Ealing. Matthew then made it to White City before the tube gave up on him, and he took a bus home (shudders).
	<br><br>
	All in all, the big 1-0 didn't disappoint. We got a surprising amount done, finished the tube*, went on a jolly outside the M25, and yet still felt alive by the end. 
	Onto Koppa 11, where we move onto finishing off the rest of London - woo!
