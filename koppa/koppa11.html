	Let's all go to Pizza Express in Woking, and hope that the bill is less than Â£12M!
	<br><br>
	You know what makes the best NT adventures? Having Matthew so stressed and so ded that he has had multiple mental breakdowns and is fully committed to drive the adventure 
	into the ground, and drive us both off a cliff! There have been multiple masterpiece adventures in the past, dictated by Matthew's shattered consciousness, but none had 
	ever come close to this level of insanity. None had pushed the limits of what was possible quite so far before. Never before had we come so close to the brink. That was 
	all about to change. Welcome to Koppa 11, the 100-station adventure.

	Amusingly, this was meant to be a fairly gentle adventure. James was in Guildford for a PhD interview and we were going to have a slow amble around Surrey, ticking off 
	some quiet commuter towns and some little branchlines, staying well away from London. Oh boy were we wrong.
	<br><br>
	We met in the car park outside the University of Surrey in Guildford, Matthew arriving a few minutes late after getting distracted by Fluids 2. James gave a whistle-stop 
	tour, Matthew received his 3rd coffee of the morning, the cameras came out, and we were off. Off very quickly, I should add. We were late for the Alton train and so 
	absolutely legged it to the station. Through the car park, down the street, into the station, along the bridge, down the stairs and onto the train, all in no time at all. 
	Got to start your day properly - the NT way.
	<br><br>
	Things went pretty much as planned though. We wound our way towards Farnborough, through quiet fields, rolling countryside and endless dreary suburbia, changed at Farnham, 
	and ended up at the end of the line in Alton, in the middle of nowhere in Hampshire. The station was attached to a heritage railway station, which was cool. We had a brief 
	look outside the station. James saw a Range Rover and a Waitrose, gave it his seal of approval, and no sooner than that we were back on the train.
</p>

<p>
	This time we took the other line out of Farnham, joining the mainline to Woking. We talked a bit about GM and Darryl (whom Matthew would soon meet and be unable to avoid), 
	before pulling into Woking in no time at all. This was what we had been waiting for. The main destination of this adventure. The highlight. Pizza Express in Woking.
	<br><br>
	We had a quick wander around the town, seeing a War of the Worlds statue and nothing much else (it was a bit shit), before heading to the Pizza Express, conveniently situated 
	near a daycare centre.

	<strong>The following hour is REDACTED. This content is unsuitable for the internet and should be viewed by nobody.</strong>
	<br><br>
	James thought he had been steeled by the Penbullingdon Club, and would be making dozens of inappropriate jokes, but only minutes in, he was begging Matthew to stop. What was 
	said in Pizza Express stays in Pizza Express... said Prince Andrew.

	As we were both over 18, we weren't able to leave Pizza Express in a classy Range Rover, so we walked back to the station instead. We got more caffeine for Matthew, and got 
	on the train once more, heading into London, up the mainline, ticking off plenty of crappy suburban stations along the way. This part of the country is grim. Why these stations 
	(in such expensive areas) are so soul-destroyingly depressing, I will never know. All I know is that we were glad to leave Byfleet, Weybridge and Walton behind, and we soon were 
	in Surbiton. We changed to the Hampton Court branch line and ticked off the 2 stations there, before getting off to have a look around.
	<br><br>
	We had only a few minutes, so we left the station and started walking towards the Thames. Fortunately, Matthew's mental breakdown was passed, so this was not to throw himself 
	into the river, but to go down to the pier and get a good shot of the palace on the other bank. Here we filmed an excellent clip of James giving a history lesson - like the TV 
	show Drunk History, except (this time) sober. Still filled with beautiful inaccuracies though. Watch out 2024 - this one's going viral!
	<br><br>
	We then crossed the bridge to the other side, finally entering London and causing James to have imminent lung failure/bronchitis. We filmed the last bit of "Sober" "History", 
	noticed the time, and sprinted back into the safety of the fresher air of Surrey, through the ticket barriers and back onto the train, completely missing the terminus sign. 
	Don't worry though, montage fans - James had a fix for that:
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Hampton Court.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	Kwality.
	<br><br>
	Alas, it was meeting time for James, and it had been approximately 3 hours since Matthew had done fluids, and 0.1 nanoseconds since he thought about them, so we now began our 
	next leg of the journey, towards the brand-new (to NT) Sutton Premier Inn, conveniently and not at all dodgily located around the back of the shopping centre, meant to the 
	money-laundering operation and the coke dealer.
	<br><br>
	This was easier said than done. The railway lines were not in our favour, and Matthew's desire to choose a horribly contorted route that would make a topologist scream didn't help. 
	We returned to Surbiton and continued up the line further towards Clapham Junction. The intention was to change and Wimbledon and take Thameslink to Sutton. Nice and simple. Matthew 
	had other ideas though. As we approached Wimbledon, Matthew started to consult the official NT Orphan map (T-shirt available in children sizes soon), and proposed a nutty idea - why 
	not go one stop further to Earlsfield, make a 0 minute connection, and double back on ourselves to tick off that last station on the line? This was clearly a terrible idea. It was 
	perfect.
	<br><br>
	The train pulled up, came to a halt, and no sooner had the doors opened did we sprint out, armed with James' dynamically destabilising bag. Down the stairs, along the corridor, 
	through the barriers, through the other barriers, up the stairs, onto the platform, and onto the waiting train, all in less than 60 seconds. Truly the NT way.
	<br><br>
	We returned to Wimbledon and disembarked this time, as we were headed to our actual destination this time. To Thameslink! Or not? Yet again, Matthew was scheming. Why not travel via 
	yet another branch line and tick off even more stations? What could go wrong? We waited for the Chessington train, as the clock ticked down. The Chessington train was kill, so we caught 
	some other train 1 stop, changed yet again and headed to Epsom instead. We reversed directions again at Epsom (see what I mean about Brownian motion), and finally went to Sutton with 
	only a few minutes to spare.

<p>
	We got to the Premier Inn with just 2 minutes to go before James' meeting, and Matthew fucked off. It was Fluids time.
	<br><br>
	<i>Elevator Music, Dyslexia and Fluids</i>
	<br><br>
	James: Where the fuck is Matthew?<br>
	Matthew was doing Fluids.<br>
	James: I am at the station now. Where is he?<br>
	Matthew was sprinting to the station from the library.<br>
	James: I am on the train now - I am leaving without him!<br>
	At this point Matthew came crashing down the station stairs, taking them 4 at a time, practically fell face-first onto the platform and threw himself between the closing doors as they 
	beeped angrily at him. Matthew is always on time.
	<br><br>
	We eavesdropped on an enlightening conversation. They were truly intellectual titans and this conversation was not to be missed. It brought back fond memories of Ffynone. NT loves and 
	endorses plebs. We were so upset when the train terminated in Epsom Downs and they left :(
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Epsom Downs.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	Matthew: These stations are basically next to each other. It will take no time at all to walk between them.<br>
	Reality: The stations were 2 miles apart through a golf course. This was going to be a fun walk.
	<br><br>
	Despite the intellectual titans from earlier politely instructing us to stay off the golf course, we declined their advice and went anyway. Straight across the driving range, ignoring 
	everyone. James was very pleased about this. Exactly what he signed up for. Off we went, straight across the range, avoiding flying golf balls, periodically re-enacting this morning's 
	events, and getting lost in the forest. James was very happy. Matthew threw himself to the floor and hid in a divot in the ground. What an opening to the video, coming in 2024!
	<br><br>
	We saw the Epsom race course, and filmed another "Sober" "History" video about the origins of the famous racecourse, before walking alongside the track towards Tattenham Corner station, 
	a ridiculously sized station for such a ridiculous location. We got on the train, and went to tick off another branch line.
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Tattenham Corner.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	We headed up to Croydon as the light started to fade, we essentially no idea of what we were doing. Maybe we were getting food? I can't actually remember. Whatever we had had planned, 
	we ignored it. The moment we left East Croydon station, a people started to sprint. Group sprinting? Time for NT to join in! A tram pulled up out of nowhere and we jumped on. It was 
	tram time.
	<br><br>
	The first port of call was that well-known safe destination - New Addington. Well renowned for safety. Not stabbings, drugs and drunken brawls. Not at all. New Addington. Not the Caerau 
	of South London. The tram wound its way through South Croydon, through increasingly miserable areas, until we suddenly emerged into the countryside... for all of about 10 seconds. Green 
	Belt. We turned up the street into New Addington and James' safety factor immediately jumped by 2 orders of magnitude. He felt so safe when we arrived at the terminus that he was willing 
	to stand outside the tram for all of 3 seconds to have this photo!
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/New Addington.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	We then returned to Croydon and went to tick off the other branch lines. First Beckenham Junction, then Elmers End. Before we knew it, it was not only dark, but we had finished every last 
	tram stop. It was the end of a (very short) era. And what a fantastic, cosmopolitan location to end this journey in - Elmers End Tesco car park, south of Croydon.
	<br><br>
	<strong>OOOH, a car park with a roof!</strong>
	<br><br>
	Wait, a Tesco car park - this was Matthew's bread and butter! Before James could say "Stop" or "No" or "What the fuck are you doing?", Matthew was climbing the emergency staircase to the 
	shaky-looking roof. It wouldn't be NT without a multistorey car park, and using a shopping trolley like a scooter on the abandoned roof at 9pm made things even better.
	<br><br>
	A meal deal for dinner? Matthew was in heaven. Epsilon time wasted, and only Â£3.50? Who was this and what had he done with James? James would never acquiesce to such an easy, simple 
	and cheap substitute for dinner! The real James would have ordered a nuclear strike if it reached 9pm without a sitdown meal. He definitely wouldn't allow Matthew to drag him down yet 
	another branch line. Yet that is exactly what we did. It was off to Hayes.
</p>

<p>
	We really, really should have gone home now. It was gone half 9, and we were exactly 50 stations in. Yet for some Godforsaken reason, Matthew was plotting and planning again, and for some 
	even more Godforsaken reason, James was willing to go along with this insanity. It was up to Lewisham, where, in the pissing rain, we stood on the platform, with Matthew calculating just 
	how many ridiculous and improbable changes could be made and how far we could go before the clock ran out, and we were abandoned somewhere in South East London for the night. We caught the 
	first train to Dartford, leaving London yet again, this time visiting Kent for the first time on NT.
	<br><br>
	Matthew had had the entire remainder of the complex system of changes planned by this point, but out of nowhere, a late Thameslink train to Slade Green showed up. To hell with the plan. We 
	were making this -4 minute connection. It was sprinting time yet again, at half 10. We jumped on the train, and switched yet again at Slade Green. God, if people could see our full journey 
	history, they'd think we were crackheads or AIs. We passed through Abbey Wood (the Elizabeth line terminus - <i>foreshadowing!</i>) and alongside the line to Woolwich. We ticked off both 
	Woolwich Arsenal and Greenwich from the DLR, to complete the 2nd line to Dartford along an improbable and time-saving combination of trains.
	<br><br>
	We leapt off the train at Deptford, and wandered down the muggily-lit Deptford High St, turned into a completely dim park, and got back on the train at New Cross. All that we needed to do 
	now was get on the Slowverground, head straight to Clapham Junction, and head home. But no. Not on NT. Not when we were merely 13 hours in. Not with only 90 stations ticked off. Not at 11pm. 
	We could do moar. 1 more ridiculous journey to cap things off. We went up to Canada Water, unifying 2 sections of the slowverground on the Official NT Â¬Orphan map, sprinted through the station, 
	along the platform, down the stairs, through the atrium, in and out of the passengers, up the escalators, and onto the other platform for the reverse train to take us to Clapham Junction.
	<br><br>
	<strong>OOH JAMIE, NO GOING TO PECKHAM! NO, NO, NOT A NICE PLACE. NO. SAY HI TO DEL BOY AND MAAAATHEWWW!</strong>
	<br><br>
	Through Peckham Rye, Denmark Hill and Clapham High Street we went, reaching the golden milestone of 100 stations in 1 adventure. Never before, never again. 81 NR stations and 19 tram stations. 
	We did more stations on this one day than we had done in entire 12 month periods in the past. And yet, we were still somehow alive. Was this true insanity? Had we finally reached the brink? 
	[Future Matthew: Oh Hell no. It gets much worse!].
	<br><br>
	We pulled into Clapham Junction, walked for what seemed like a mile to James' platform, and parted ways after a very long day, both just about making it home before the trains finally stopped 
	for the night. It isn't often that we have an adventure that is immediately one of the greats, but this was the exception. Koppa 11 was instantly iconic, and one of the best adventures we have 
	ever had. It truly put the Nutty into Nutty Trains.
