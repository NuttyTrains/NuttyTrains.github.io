	Let's all go to Pizza Express in Woking, and hope that the bill is less than Â£12M!

	You know what makes the best NT adventures? Having Matthew so stressed and so ded that he has had multiple mental breakdowns and is fully committed to drive the adventure 
	into the ground, and drive us both off a cliff! There have been multiple masterpiece adventures in the past, dictated by Matthew's shattered consciousness, but none had 
	ever come close to this level of insanity. None had pushed the limits of what was possible quite so far before. Never before had we come so close to the brink. That was 
	all about to change. Welcome to Koppa 11, the 100-station adventure.

	Amusingly, this was meant to be a fairly gentle adventure. James was in Guildford for a PhD interview and we were going to have a slow amble around Surrey, ticking off 
	some quiet commuter towns and some little branchlines, staying well away from London. Oh boy were we wrong.
	<br><br>
	We met in the car park outside the University of Surrey in Guildford, Matthew arriving a few minutes late after getting distracted by Fluids 2. James gave a whistle-stop 
	tour, Matthew received his 3rd coffee of the morning, the cameras came out, and we were off. Off very quickly, I should add. We were late for the Alton train and so 
	absolutely legged it to the station. Through the car park, down the street, into the station, along the bridge, down the stairs and onto the train, all in no time at all. 
	Got to start your day properly - the NT way.
	<br><br>
	Things went pretty much as planned though. We wound our way towards Farnborough, through quiet fields, rolling countryside and endless dreary suburbia, changed at Farnham, 
	and ended up at the end of the line in Alton, in the middle of nowhere in Hampshire. The station was attached to a heritage railway station, which was cool. We had a brief 
	look outside the station. James saw a Range Rover and a Waitrose, gave it his seal of approval, and no sooner than that we were back on the train.

	This time we took the other line out of Farnham, joining the mainline to Woking. We talked a bit about GM and Darryl (whom Matthew would soon meet and be unable to avoid), 
	before pulling into Woking in no time at all. This was what we had been waiting for. The main destination of this adventure. The highlight. Pizza Express in Woking.
	<br><br>
	We had a quick wander around the town, seeing a War of the Worlds statue and nothing much else (it was a bit shit), before heading to the Pizza Express, conveniently situated 
	near a daycare centre.

	James thought he had been steeled by the Penbullingdon Club, and would be making dozens of inappropriate jokes, but only minutes in, he was begging Matthew to stop. What was 
	said in Pizza Express stays in Pizza Express... said Prince Andrew.
	<br><br>
	<strong>You should have asked for a kids' menu - I'm sure they have plenty</strong>
	<br><br>
	As we were both over 18, we weren't able to leave Pizza Express in a classy Range Rover, so we walked back to the station instead. We got more caffeine for Matthew, and got 
	on the train once more, heading into London, up the mainline, ticking off plenty of crappy suburban stations along the way. This part of the country is grim. Why these stations 
	(in such expensive areas) are so soul-destroyingly depressing, I will never know. All I know is that we were glad to leave Byfleet, Weybridge and Walton behind, and we soon were 
	in Surbiton. We changed to the Hampton Court branch line and ticked off the 2 stations there, before getting off to have a look around.
