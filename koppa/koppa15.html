    #IKEAreallymeansIKEA - We continue our quest to visit every IKEA in London, ticking off an unprecedented 2 IKEAs in 1 day, before mopping up our final stations 
    in West London - returning to the roots of Koppa!

    <strong>WELCOME BACK TO THE AMNESIA ZONE!</strong>
    <br><br>
    Join Matthew on the 7th episode of his archaeological dig deep into the traumas of 2022/23. This was a gentle adventure where we just did some fun stuff in 
    London. Matthew needed this one - let's just say that he'd had a hard week. Matthew was kind of pre-occupied, so never wrote anything down. Oops. Hopefully 
    I can stitch this account together from the limited information available.

this room stinks. these people apparently dont shower.

    If you couldn't tell from the above message, James was in Imperial for a week of LEAN... which means it was time for a Koppa!
    <br><br>
    We met in the MLC, Matthew's home at the time. Matthew walked into the room to find it had been invaded by outsiders, and that James had stolen his desk! 
    The audacity! Matthew had slept so many nights (and days) at that desk - he had heard of the Queen's death at that desk. He is quite glad he is not like that 
    anymore.
    <br><br>
    This is to be yet another cinematic adventure, given that we left no other records, apparently (and filmed everything on James' phone). If a video ever appears from 
    this adventure, I will naturally replace these videos with James' nice YouTube video.

    #IKEAmeansIKEA. What a joke. No, this time #IKEAreallymeansIKEA - we'd just been to Reading IKEA, so now we were well-prepared: it was time to visit London 
    IKEAs - not just 1, but 2 in one afternoon! It was time to visit Hammersmith! Hammersmith is a weird IKEA, and I am not 100% certain that 'Hugo' would count 
    it as official, but what does he know? NT counts it as official! It is a small but sweet IKEA in the middle of a town centre, right next to a tube station, 
    which is honestly basically perfect for us. Tick!
    <br><br>
    Then, without a second glance, it was off all the way to North Greenwich to yet another IKEA... which was slightly tougher to arrive at. I recall walking for 
    many hundreds of metres around the perimeter of the Millennium Dome (where we probably shouldn't have been walking) to finally arrive at our destination. This 
    IKEA looks very impressive on the outside (and honestly, same in the canteen - James probably rated it 4 Bhahajs out of 5). Together, we picked up a 
    veritable haul:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Smoky Tealights</li>
    <li>Apple Slicer</li>
    <li>Tape Measure</li>
    <li>Scissors</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <s>Ah yes, nothing like carrying scissors on the tube.</s> It was now moderately late, but we couldn't end there! Matthew was feeling very cheerful for the 
    first time that week, so to make him happy, James agreed that we could go off on a late-night trip to tick off some awkward stations in West London. This 
    always, always makes Matthew very happy. If he is feeling sad, just take him to West London <strong>(JAMES I HOPE YOU ARE READING THIS!)</strong>
    <br><br>
    <strong>Welcome to the demi-semi fast express!</strong>
    <br><br>
    It was Mary-le-bone time - time to catch the demi-semi fast express to the most awkward stations in existence! This High Wycombe train seemed to stop at an... 
    interesting selection of stations. I think it broke James' brain (which was already teetering on the brink, after half a week in the LEAN workshop). But 
    nevertheless, we ticked off the 3 annoying stations, Sudbury & Harrow Road, Sudbury Harrow Hill (not confusing at all) and South Ruislip. Then out train departed for 
    Bowisland, and we hopped off, very happy.

<p>
    Then it was back down on the Central line to Greenford for another annoying branch line - the orphaned <s>GWR</s>, sorry - <strong>First Great Western</strong> 
    branch line from Ealing to Greenford! This line starts at a cool island platform in Greenford, then starts climbing, as if to cross the Central line on a viaduct, 
    before changing its mind and descending... actually, I'll let the potato-quality video show you:

    <video width="47%" controls><source src="../resources/video/Castle Bar Park.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>
<p>
    We had a really fun time on this branch line, I have to be honest. Should this branch line exist? Probably not. Should it still be run by First Great Western? 
    Certainly not. But as you can see from the shitty little videos, we had a fun time (and thank God, Matthew removed that <i>terrible</i> facial hair from Ξ7!). 
    Finally, we pulled into West Ealing, which we had apparently never ticked off before (typical Lizzie line: RIP Lizzie), and at last ticked it off, finishing 
    all of the (open) Lizzie line stations at long last. And yes, this is foreshadowing - tune into Koppa 16 for the <i>actual</i>, even more anti-climactic Lizzie 
    line finale!

<p>
    James headed back to their classic Ealing Premier Inn (they had managed to convince the LEAN lot to stay there with them, and now James was public enemy #1 but 
    illi vitae), and Matthew headed home. The next time you meet the dynamic duo, we'll be much more stressed and much more anxious... welcome to 4th year! Woo!
