	Can Matthew and James pull multiple 12 hour+ tube challenge simulations in succession? Can Matthew find his way across London after being blindfolded and abandoned 
	in a field in Enfield with no phone or map? Can James finally get Matthew to order some cider? Yes. Yes we can.
	<br><br>
	I could go into the background for this adventure, as it involved a surprising amount of planning for a shitty Koppa. But instead, I will direct you to our amazing 
	youtube channel, where we planned it all, live on camera, during NT Live! I know you must be desperate to sit through the full 90-minute video, so I won't keep you - 
	go and like and subscribe!

	Oh you are back? Great! I bet you really enjoyed and watched the whole video :)
	<br><br>
	Thus, I do not need to tell you that this time, for some unknown reason, James decided to head to the Premier Inn in Earl's Court, rather than his usual haunt in 
	Ealing Broadway. This was the world's most cursed Premier Inn, right next to the main road, and in yummy, yummy Earl's Court. James was very impressed. Not.
	<br><br>
	So it was here, dear reader, that we started Koppa 8: outside James' new Premier Inn, next to the A4, in Earl's Court. We were meant to meet in PAD, but Matthew 
	was lazy, and wanted extra sleep. So we began this adventure by crossing the A4, and walking to West Brompton - it was Slowverground time!
	<br><br>
	We took the Slowverground to Brondesbury, then alighted, walked up the street, and got on the Jubilee at Kilburn. We then hopped from train to train, from 
	Jubilee to Met, all the way past Moor Park, and into unknown territory, out of London, and into the GREEN - NT was going to Chesham! As we passed further from London, 
	the air quality improved and the landscape became greener and greener, to James' complete surprise - <i>breathing? In London? On the tube? What was this heresy?</i> We 
	passed a Waitrose right next to Rickmansworth, and for the first time, James believed - <s>this wasn't Kansas anymore, Toto</s> this wasn't London anymore, Matthew! It 
	was incredibly strange, especially after we passed Chalfont and Latimer and the line became single track. We wound our way up a narrow valley line, surrounded by green 
	on all sides. It was really beautiful, and very strange - we even saw 2 deer!

<p>
	Finally, we pulled into the quaint Chesham station, complete with station garden and signal box (and toilets), which was also very nice. We walked down into the town 
	centre, and wandered down the main street, looking for somewhere to have lunch. When we came across a half-timbered, dimly-lit pub, complete with old codgers (the George 
	and Dragon), we knew we'd found the place! We headed inside and had some lunch, talking about how old we were (to the derision of the old codgers).
	<br><br>
	<strong>"Replit is 'wonky'"</strong>
	<br><br>
	After lunch, we walked up the town's main street, seeing all the shops it had to offer, before turning towards the park, passing some very quaint houses first. Here, 
	James met some ducks (and also what seemed to be a bona fide crane), and we sat and listened to some jazz in the park, because that seems to be what we do nowadays 
	during NT. I don't know how we ended up this way, but we did. And I am not complaining. (Although the Watford band put the Chesham one to shame. Shame, I tell you!)
	<br><br>
	Matthew decided to climb to the very top of the park, so we did exactly that. We stood at the top and admired the view, before standing atop some kind of tumulus, where 
	Matthew started to spin around in circles very rapidly until he became incredibly dizzy and feel flat on his face. Matthew is a child.
	<br><br>
	We then returned to the station, boarded the once-per-half hour train down the scenic branch line, and disembarked at Chalfont & Latimer, just missing our Amersham train 
	by seconds. I guess we were waiting then!

<p>
	After more than 15 minutes of waiting, we decided to get on the first train that arrived, which happened to be a Chiltern train, despite our traumatising experience 
	of that Chiltern train from Dorridge just the previous day. This one wasn't quite as hot though, and one stop later, we disembarked, having reached the end of the Met 
	(even though the dot matrix was adamant that northbound Met trains existed). Amersham was a lovely, red, wrought iron station, but we didn't get to see any of the town, 
	as a few minutes later, the Met showed its sorry face and finally turned up. It was back into the Big Smoke for Matthew and James!
	<br><br>
	We took the Met back into London, reaching Wembley Park, and changed to the Jubilee to head north to Stanmore, ticking off our final Jubilee line stations (get used to 
	this - we tick of <i>a lot</i> of lines on this adventure!)
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Stanmore.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	At Stanmore, we stood there, making fun of the pigeon that was trapped in the station roof, unable to get out (or get in for that matter - how the fuck did he manage 
	that?), and exited the cottage-like station. We crossed the road and walked straight up the street, and in about 100 yards, we came up against a wooden forest gate, the 
	gate marking the very edge of London. NT was escaping the Big Smoke once more!
	<br><br>
	Whilst James' lungs were thankful of this, his legs were about to regret it. We were now climbing Stanmore Hill, the tallest hill in North London, which was 'only a 10 
	minute walk', said Matthew. This might have been true, if Matthew hadn't managed to get lost on the way up. Round of applause, Matthew. Round of applause for getting lost 
	not once, not twice, but 3 times on the way up this hill, before we reached the vantage point at the top. It was worth it though (at least to Matthew - James thought it 
	was shit - you couldn't see the sea). Matthew on the other hand, really enjoyed the view - you could see how surprisingly green London was, as well as spotting all the 
	landmarks in the entire city, natural and manmade, from the Shard to Wembley, from Heathrow to Parliament Hill, from Crystal Palace to the North Downs. 10/10 would 
	recommend, if you fancy looking down on everyone else who thinks they have climbed a high hill in London!
	<br><br>
	We then descended the hill and walked along until we reached Watling Street, the Roman road where, ahem, "Maggie sent her legions, marching off to the North, to subdue 
	the rebellious coal miners" - James Arthur, "James Arthur's 100% accurate guide to history", Youtube, 2025
	<br><br>
	Just off Watling Street was a curious collection of new-build streets, named Fry Lane, Brannigan Way, and Farnsworth Drive... named after Futurama. No, I am not making 
	this up. This is 100% real. As real as the Jew jokes James made right before we passed the Synagogue, and the Pleb jokes he made right before we passed the Almshouse.
	<br><br>
	We then reached Edgware, having completed one of the changes we will have to make whilst doing a tube challenge, and James was deeply disappointed. Despite Jay Foreman 
	coming from Edgware, it was dirty, polluted, and crap. He was very glad to get on the Northern line and head back into London, ticking off yet another new branch in the 
	north.

	Despite this being the Northern line, which we usually despise, it was actually a fairly pleasant trip back into London. We passed the shithole that is Brent Cross, 
	passed through the deepest tube station (Hampstead), and then returned to the Art St'd'n' 'oldin' P'n - Camden. Fortunately, this was only a flying visit, as we 
	promptly pushed our way past the art students blocking the way up the escalator, pushed our way past the art students having sex in the middle of the ticket barriers, 
	and pushed our way past the art students doing LSD 'to embrace their inner creativity' in the station entrance. And yes, here at NT, we regard all of these acts as 
	equivalently despicable.
	<br><br>
	We walked to Camden Road and boarded the slowverground, heading back towards Kensal, before getting off at Brondesbury for the single most important part of NT: food. 
	We went to Quartieri and had pizza, which was very nice (and nice and cheap), before returning to the overground.
	<br><br>
	At this point, we were 2 and 6 stops respectively away from home for the night, so a sensible idea would have been to call it a day and head home. But this is NT, and we 
	don't do 'sensible'. Thus, Matthew's brain started whirring, and came up with a stupid plan, to continue our tube challenge simulation deeper into the night! We returned 
	to Camden Road, reversed back down the street to Camden Town, seeing all the same art students still high/orgasmed out, and got back on the Northern line, this time heading 
	north to the other branch! Once again, for the misery line, it was not that bad, especially when we surfaced into the crisp late-night air. We saw the beautifully-lit 
	East Finchley, all bedecked in sodium lighting, and changed at Finchley Central to the Mill Hill East shuttle (which may have been replaced by through trains at the 
	time of writing - RIP). For once during NT, this connection was actually planned well - the trains entered and left the station at the same time, allowing for maximum 
	interchange possibilities - I guess there is a first for everything!
	<br><br>
	We rode the shuttle up, had a look around the station (which was quite nice), and rode it back. Branch-line - tick! Finally, we continued all the way up to the terminus, 
	at High Barnet, thereby completing the Northern Line (for all of about 3 weeks, when it uncompleted itself - stupid bastard of a line). Tick! 
	We wandered all around the station, filming shitty clips at the end of one of the platforms, before getting back on the train and heading back into London once more.
</p>

<center><img src="../resources/photos/High Barnet.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	Once again, this would have been a sensible place to terminate the adventure, as it was even later, and we were even further from home. So naturally, Matthew's brain went 
	into overdrive, and he attempted to come up with the single dumbest plan we have ever attempted on NT. Let's talk through it briefly:
</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Step 1: Take the Northern line back to Camden Town yet again</li>
		<li>Step 2: Make a 4 minute connection from Camden Town to Camden Road and take the penultimate train to Stratford, ticking off the NLL</li>
		<li>Step 3: Make a 2 minute connection at Stratford to catch the penultimate Jubilee line train</li>
		<li>Step 4: Make a 1 minute connection at West Ham to catch the final District line train of the night</li>
		<li>Step 5:...</li>
		<li>Step 6: Profit</li>
	</ul>
<p>
	To everyone remotely sensible, this seemed completely and utterly impossible, but not to Matthew, thanks to his remarkable ability to collapse every event in an 
	itinerary into epsilon-time. So when we reached Camden Town, we marched out of the station and down towards Camden Road, fully believing that this was a stupid idea, 
	and that we'd see our train passing over the viaduct, out of our reach, any moment now.
	<br><br>
	... But that moment never came! As we drew closer to the station, Matthew started to jog, and then sprint into the station, as he realised that we might have a chance of 
	making this! We passed through the barriers, ran up the stairs to Platform 1 as the sounds of the train grew louder, and reached the top... only to find that the train was 
	on the other platform. Phew!
	<br><br>
	... wait a minute
	<br><br>
	What was the destination of that train?
	<br><br>
	<strong>HOLY FUCK JAMES, WE ARE ON THE WRONG PLATFORM!</strong>
	<br><br>
	We sprinted down the stairs, through the concourse, up the other stairs, weaving past the disembarking passengers, and onto the other platform as the train doors started 
	beeping. Matthew sprinted even faster, leapt aboard the train, through the closing doors, and just made it!
	<br><br>
	...But James didn't
	<br><br>
	<strong>"Bye!"<br>
	"Wow, your friend looks so disappointed to have missed his train"</strong>
	<br><br>
	And to make matters even worse, we both got fined for exceeding maximum journey times! What do you mean, we can't make a journey from Zone 2 to Zone 2 via Zone 6? Outrageous!
	<br><br>
	We both made our way back to Earl's Court, James via the Northern and Piccadilly lines, and Matthew by walking to Caledonian Road (after running into an <i>extremely</i> 
	drunk man), and taking the Piccadilly all the way. We reunited in his cursed Premier Inn room, investigated the orgy corridor, watched some clips, and then Matthew headed 
	home, via some night buses and Huxley (Matthew's true home).
	<br><br>
	Started Day 2 by mopping up the Circle line and repeating last nightâs plan to Stratford. Headed up to Epping & Fairlop on the Central line and went to another pub. 
	Matthew blindfolded himself at Stratford and was taken to Enfield Lock, then on a bus, and dumped in a field with no phone. After 2 hours, he found his way to Wraysbury 
	in Surrey, via Cheshunt, Tottenham Hale, Warren Street and Waterloo, and had a half-pint in the pub. James had been sitting there happily for an hour. We wandered 
	around the London Eye and up to Embankment before starting the H&C and having an Indian in City Spice, grossly overpaying. Headed up to West Ham on the District 
	before returning to the City (the balcony), walking over Tower Bridge, through Southwark and over the Millennium Bridge before taking 4 quick night buses to Earls 
	Court in 33 mins. Matthew then staggered home after walking up Regent Street in the cold and the rain.

<!--These adventures have taken us to places that are dingy, desolate and even dangerous, but Enfield Lock is a strong contender for the most depressing station we'd ever seen-->
<p>
	By Day 3, we were completely and utterly dead, Matthew especially, who had caught a cold after walking through the cold and the rain the previous night, and now had a 
	very sore throat. Our plans to meet at Earl's Court went out the window, so we instead met at Embankment, where the 
	Bakerloo meets the District, to finish off our tube challenge simulation, and take the District to Upminster. This was a fairly sedate trip, as we'd done most of the 
	District before, and were too kill to do anything else apart from monologue to the camera. We passed through "lovely" East London, and stopped at Dagenham (twice), once 
	the largest council estate in the world, before reaching the end of the District line and almost the edge of London yet again. What was it with this adventure? We had 
	managed to tick off yet another tube line - tick!
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Upminster.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	We wandered the station, looking for toilets, tapped out and back in to not get fined yet again for NT antics, and then decided that catching a c2c train 1 stop to Barking 
	would shave off some time. So that is exactly what we did! It was quite nice starting yet another TOC - NT is quite looking forward to heading out towards Southend, 
	Britain's newest city.
	<br><br>
	At Barking, we changed to the H&C to head home, thereby managing to jump from 0% completion of the line to about 80% by the end of this adventure, as we rode the train all 
	the way from its terminus in Barking to Edgware Road, filling in the hardest part of Matthew's map, and making him very happy indeed. We had intended to go further again, 
	and finish the line in one fell swoop, but time was running short, so we abandoned this project for Koppa 9, and took the Circle line to HSK and the District to Earl's Court 
	instead (exploring platform 4 of HSK on the way - it was intriguing). There, James collected his stuff, we bought food [a meal deal ;)] in Sainsbury's, weaved in and out of 
	the various 'people' one encounters in Earl's Court, and we got back on the District, back to PAD.
	<br><br>
	This had been a fairly well-planned end to the adventure by our usual standards - we were still in one piece, were kind of functioning, and even had 10 minutes until James' 
	train! Phwoar, that really was something. But to cap it all off, Matthew whipped out his lunch - perfect for someone with a sore throat - a bag of red hot chili-flavoured 
	Doritos! James made sure to capture this on camera for Mrs Arthur, who was dutifully sent into a tizzy at the thought of this.
	<br><br>
	And with that, the summer of NT was almost kill... apart from the crowning glory, back in <a href="./sampi.html">Markeyland...</a> Tune in for Sampi VII!
