	Can Matthew and James pull multiple 12 hour+ tube challenge simulations in succession? Can Matthew find his way across London after being blindfolded and abandoned 
	in a field in Enfield with no phone or map? Can James finally get Matthew to order some cider? Yes. Yes we can.
	<br><br>
	I could go into the background for this adventure, as it involved a surprising amount of planning for a shitty Koppa. But instead, I will direct you to our amazing 
	youtube channel, where we planned it all, live on camera, during NT Live! I know you must be desperate to sit through the full 90-minute video, so I won't keep you - 
	go and like and subscribe!

	Oh you are back? Great! I bet you really enjoyed and watched the whole video :)
	<br><br>
	Thus, I do not need to tell you that this time, for some unknown reason, James decided to head to the Premier Inn in Earl's Court, rather than his usual haunt in 
	Ealing Broadway. This was the world's most cursed Premier Inn, right next to the main road, and in yummy, yummy Earl's Court. James was very impressed. Not.
	<br><br>
	So it was here, dear reader, that we started Koppa 8: outside James' new Premier Inn, next to the A4, in Earl's Court. We were meant to meet in PAD, but Matthew 
	was lazy, and wanted extra sleep. So we began this adventure by crossing the A4, and walking to West Brompton - it was Slowverground time!
	<br><br>
	We took the Slowverground to Brondesbury, then alighted, walked up the street, and got on the Jubilee at Kilburn. We then hopped from train to train, from 
	Jubilee to Met, all the way past Moor Park, and into unknown territory, out of London, and into the GREEN - NT was going to Chesham! As we passed further from London, 
	the air quality improved and the landscape became greener and greener, to James' complete surprise - <i>breathing? In London? On the tube? What was this heresy?</i> We 
	passed a Waitrose right next to Rickmansworth, and for the first time, James believed - <s>this wasn't Kansas anymore, Toto</s> this wasn't London anymore, Matthew! It 
	was incredibly strange, especially after we passed Chalfont and Latimer and the line became single track. We wound our way up a narrow valley line, surrounded by green 
	on all sides. It was really beautiful, and very strange - we even saw 2 deer!

<p>
	Finally, we pulled into the quaint Chesham station, complete with station garden and signal box (and toilets), which was also very nice. We walked down into the town 
	centre, and wandered down the main street, looking for somewhere to have lunch. When we came across a half-timbered, dimly-lit pub, complete with old codgers (the George 
	and Dragon), we knew we'd found the place! We headed inside and had some lunch, talking about how old we were (to the derision of the old codgers).
	<br><br>
	<strong>"Replit is 'wonky'"</strong>
	<br><br>
	After lunch, we walked up the town's main street, seeing all the shops it had to offer, before turning towards the park, passing some very quaint houses first. Here, 
	James met some ducks (and also what seemed to be a bona fide crane), and we sat and listened to some jazz in the park, because that seems to be what we do nowadays 
	during NT. I don't know how we ended up this way, but we did. And I am not complaining. (Although the Watford band put the Chesham one to shame. Shame, I tell you!)
	<br><br>
	Matthew decided to climb to the very top of the park, so we did exactly that. We stood at the top and admired the view, before standing atop some kind of tumulus, where 
	Matthew started to spin around in circles very rapidly until he became incredibly dizzy and feel flat on his face. Matthew is a child.
	<br><br>
	We then returned to the station, boarded the once-per-half hour train down the scenic branch line, and disembarked at Chalfont & Latimer, just missing our Amersham train 
	by seconds. I guess we were waiting then!

<p>
	After more than 15 minutes of waiting, we decided to get on the first train that arrived, which happened to be a Chiltern train, despite our traumatising experience 
	of that Chiltern train from Dorridge just the previous day. This one wasn't quite as hot though, and one stop later, we disembarked, having reached the end of the Met 
	(even though the dot matrix was adamant that northbound Met trains existed). Amersham was a lovely, red, wrought iron station, but we didn't get to see any of the town, 
	as a few minutes later, the Met showed its sorry face and finally turned up. It was back into the Big Smoke for Matthew and James!
	<br><br>
	We took the Met back into London, reaching Wembley Park, and changed to the Jubilee to head north to Stanmore, ticking off our final Jubilee line stations (get used to 
	this - we tick off <i>a lot</i> of lines on this adventure!)
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Stanmore.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<center><iframe id="largevid" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V8GXLu9P3OQ" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>
<p>
	At Stanmore, we stood there, making fun of the pigeon that was trapped in the station roof, unable to get out (or get in for that matter - how the fuck did he manage 
	that?), and exited the cottage-like station. We crossed the road and walked straight up the street, and in about 100 yards, we came up against a wooden forest gate, the 
	gate marking the very edge of London. NT was escaping the Big Smoke once more!
	<br><br>
	Whilst James' lungs were thankful of this, his legs were about to regret it. We were now climbing Stanmore Hill, the tallest hill in North London, which was 'only a 10 
	minute walk', said Matthew. This might have been true, if Matthew hadn't managed to get lost on the way up. Round of applause, Matthew. Round of applause for getting lost 
	not once, not twice, but 3 times on the way up this hill, before we reached the vantage point at the top. It was worth it though (at least to Matthew - James thought it 
	was shit - you couldn't see the sea). Matthew on the other hand, really enjoyed the view - you could see how surprisingly green London was, as well as spotting all the 
	landmarks in the entire city, natural and manmade, from the Shard to Wembley, from Heathrow to Parliament Hill, from Crystal Palace to the North Downs. 10/10 would 
	recommend, if you fancy looking down on everyone else who thinks they have climbed a high hill in London!
	<br><br>
	We then descended the hill and walked along until we reached Watling Street, the Roman road where, ahem, "Maggie sent her legions, marching off to the North, to subdue 
	the rebellious coal miners" - James Arthur, "James Arthur's 100% accurate guide to history", Youtube, 2025
	<br><br>
	Just off Watling Street was a curious collection of new-build streets, named Fry Lane, Brannigan Way, and Farnsworth Drive... named after Futurama. No, I am not making 
	this up. This is 100% real. As real as the Jew jokes James made right before we passed the Synagogue, and the Pleb jokes he made right before we passed the Almshouse.
	<br><br>
	We then reached Edgware, having completed one of the changes we will have to make whilst doing a tube challenge, and James was deeply disappointed. Despite Jay Foreman 
	coming from Edgware, it was dirty, polluted, and crap. He was very glad to get on the Northern line and head back into London, ticking off yet another new branch in the 
	north.

<p>
	Despite this being the Northern line, which we usually despise, it was actually a fairly pleasant trip back into London. We passed the shithole that is Brent Cross, 
	passed through the deepest tube station (Hampstead), and then returned to the Art St'd'n' 'oldin' P'n - Camden. Fortunately, this was only a flying visit, as we 
	promptly pushed our way past the art students blocking the way up the escalator, pushed our way past the art students having sex in the middle of the ticket barriers, 
	and pushed our way past the art students doing LSD 'to embrace their inner creativity' in the station entrance. And yes, here at NT, we regard all of these acts as 
	equivalently despicable.
	<br><br>
	We walked to Camden Road and boarded the slowverground, heading back towards Kensal, before getting off at Brondesbury for the single most important part of NT: food. 
	We went to Quartieri and had pizza, which was very nice (and nice and cheap), before returning to the overground.
	<br><br>
	At this point, we were 2 and 6 stops respectively away from home for the night, so a sensible idea would have been to call it a day and head home. But this is NT, and we 
	don't do 'sensible'. Thus, Matthew's brain started whirring, and came up with a stupid plan, to continue our tube challenge simulation deeper into the night! We returned 
	to Camden Road, reversed back down the street to Camden Town, seeing all the same art students still high/orgasmed out, and got back on the Northern line, this time heading 
	north to the other branch! Once again, for the misery line, it was not that bad, especially when we surfaced into the crisp late-night air. We saw the beautifully-lit 
	East Finchley, all bedecked in sodium lighting, and changed at Finchley Central to the Mill Hill East shuttle (which may have been replaced by through trains at the 
	time of writing - RIP). For once during NT, this connection was actually planned well - the trains entered and left the station at the same time, allowing for maximum 
	interchange possibilities - I guess there is a first for everything!
	<br><br>
	We rode the shuttle up, had a look around the station (which was quite nice), and rode it back. Branch-line - tick! Finally, we continued all the way up to the terminus, 
	at High Barnet, thereby completing the Northern Line (for all of about 3 weeks, when it uncompleted itself - stupid bastard of a line). Tick! 
	We wandered all around the station, filming shitty clips at the end of one of the platforms, before getting back on the train and heading back into London once more.
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Mill Hill East.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/High Barnet.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	Once again, this would have been a sensible place to terminate the adventure, as it was even later, and we were even further from home. So naturally, Matthew's brain went 
	into overdrive, and he attempted to come up with the single dumbest plan we have ever attempted on NT. Let's talk through it briefly:
</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Step 1: Take the Northern line back to Camden Town yet again</li>
		<li>Step 2: Make a 4 minute connection from Camden Town to Camden Road and take the penultimate train to Stratford, ticking off the NLL</li>
		<li>Step 3: Make a 2 minute connection at Stratford to catch the penultimate Jubilee line train</li>
		<li>Step 4: Make a 1 minute connection at West Ham to catch the final District line train of the night</li>
		<li>Step 5:...</li>
		<li>Step 6: Profit</li>
	</ul>
<p>
	To everyone remotely sensible, this seemed completely and utterly impossible, but not to Matthew, thanks to his remarkable ability to collapse every event in an 
	itinerary into epsilon-time. So when we reached Camden Town, we marched out of the station and down towards Camden Road, fully believing that this was a stupid idea, 
	and that we'd see our train passing over the viaduct, out of our reach, any moment now.
	<br><br>
	... But that moment never came! As we drew closer to the station, Matthew started to jog, and then sprint into the station, as he realised that we might have a chance of 
	making this! We passed through the barriers, ran up the stairs to Platform 1 as the sounds of the train grew louder, and reached the top... only to find that the train was 
	on the other platform. Phew!
	<br><br>
	... wait a minute
	<br><br>
	What was the destination of that train?
	<br><br>
	<strong>HOLY FUCK JAMES, WE ARE ON THE WRONG PLATFORM!</strong>
	<br><br>
	We sprinted down the stairs, through the concourse, up the other stairs, weaving past the disembarking passengers, and onto the other platform as the train doors started 
	beeping. Matthew sprinted even faster, leapt aboard the train, through the closing doors, and just made it!
	<br><br>
	...But James didn't
	<br><br>
	<strong>"Bye!"<br>
	"Wow, your friend looks so disappointed to have missed his train"</strong>
	<br><br>
	And to make matters even worse, we both got fined for exceeding maximum journey times! What do you mean, we can't make a journey from Zone 2 to Zone 2 via Zone 6? Outrageous!
	<br><br>
	We both made our way back to Earl's Court, James via the Northern and Piccadilly lines, and Matthew by walking to Caledonian Road (after running into an <i>extremely</i> 
	drunk man), and taking the Piccadilly all the way. We reunited in his cursed Premier Inn room, investigated the orgy corridor, watched some clips, and then Matthew headed 
	home, via some night buses and Huxley (Matthew's true home).
</p>
<center><iframe id="largevid" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J_h4UekKUyU" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>
<p>
	Now, despite this being Koppa 8, and despite the fact that we had spent the previous day mopping up parts of Zones 4-9, we had still not actually finished the Circle 
	line itself. So when we met up for the start of Day 2 in Earl's Court, this was precisely the first port of call - complete the Circle line (specifically the bit from 
	Westminster to Cannon St). No jumping on and off required though, as we had already done all of these stations before, just on the District line.
	<br><br>
	We followed the Circle line all the way to Kings Cross, from where we travelled to Camden Town yet again, to complete our failed plan from the night before - take the 
	North London line to Stratford (henceforth known as Strazza). This time though, we made 2 crucial improvements - 1) we did this during the day, and 2) we went to the 
	right platform this time :)
	<br><br>
	Once at Stratford, we transferred to the Central line, and headed north, to complete yet another line, by heading to Epping! Once again, we passed further and 
	further through suburban outer London, and by the time we reached Loughton, we were so far out that James could almost breathe! We passed through green fields once more, 
	crossed under the M25 (the boundary of London, as defined by James himself), and finally pulled into Epping, recreating the iconic Beth 9 shot:
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Epping.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	Just like in Chesham, we went on a little wander through the quaint town centre, which was nowhere near as bad as its location (Essex) implies. We found another nice 
	pub (James likes ethanol), also called the George and Dragon, and headed in for lunch, the most important part of an NT adventure.
	<br><br>
	Despite James' new Oxford money, they were very uneager to take it off his hands - they really took their time in coming to take our order, and they took even more time 
	when serving our food. The food was nice, but not nice enough to justify that wait, so we had some soup and cider (Matthew even had a sip of James' cider!), and left. 
	Good riddance!
	<br><br>
	We wandered past the elegant clocktower, spotted an authenic Chinese sit-down restaurant (Qing-themed, not grease-stained like we were expecting), saw the Winston Churchill 
	plaque (he was the town's MP), wandered through the market, and tried to stalk James' friend Katie again, before returning to the station.
	<br><br>
	The line doesn't actually end at Epping. The tracks continue north to Ongar, the original central line terminus, now home to a heritage railway, which operates buses to 
	Shenfield and Epping. In the distant future, they hope to be able to have their trains pull up adjacent to the central line trains in Epping Station, which will be amazing. 
	In the nearer term, when we do the Lizzie line, we will hop over on the Routemaster to the Epping-Ongar railway, and tick off some more heritage railway stations!

<p>
	We then returned to Woodford, where we changed trains, to go around the Fairlop loop. It took forever for one to turn up, but when it did, we had the entire train just to 
	ourselves for the whole Woodford-Hainault journey. It was utterly fantastic! We'd never had the <i>whole train</i> to ourselves before! It is easy to see why this section 
	is the least used on the tube!
	<br><br>
	We returned to more civilised bits of the tube, as we headed down to complete the loop, and complete the line. We took a minor detour at Gants Hill to admire the 
	Soviet-inspired station (vey nice! great success! I lovesa communism, vey nice!), before returning to Layton and Stratford, completing the Central line - tick!
	<br><br>
	After this, we headed back to Strazza, intending to continue with our Tube Challenge sim, by moving to the next line over: the Lizzie Line. However, as it was now 
	mid-Afternoon, and that we didn't have many hours of daylight left, we decided instead to proceed with our fantastic plan. Screw the Lizzie Line - it was challenge time!
	<br><br>
	Now is the time I should probably explain how this came about. A few weeks prior to this adventure, right before James went hashing, Matthew called James, eager to tell 
	him about his latest idea for a challenge - a challenge to top all others, a challenge to put all others to shame! Matthew would blindfold himself and put headphones on, 
	then James would take him on the train/bus/taxi (TBD) to a random location, take his phone away, give him a random location to travel to, and then abandon him! What could 
	go wrong?
	<br><br>
	We pulled up in Stratford and exited the station, so that James could top up his Oyster card, and so that we could stand on the Meridian line in glorious Stratford. Mm, 
	yummy, Stratford. Then, Matthew took out his phone, put his earphones in, and turned up the music to a maximum. He took out his mask, and placed it over his face, 
	blindfolding himself. He was ready - it was abandonment time!
	<br><br>
	We walked through the station complex, making our way to a far platform, and sat facing away from the train. Throughout all this time, Matthew sat there, blindfolded 
	with his mask and deafened by his music for a good 15 minutes. Finally, the train turned up, and we boarded, Matthew squinting through his fingers whilst stepping onto 
	the train, so as not to fall down the gap between the train and the platform. See, we at NT have great respect for health and safety - clearly. So we sat on the Greater 
	Anglia train as the doors closed and the train slowly pulled off. The challenge had begun!
	<br><br>
	Now for this section, Matthew had absolutely no idea what was going on. He spent the entire journey making unintelligible sign language at James, much to James' amusement, 
	as he filmed almost the entire thing. See if you can decipher Matthew's sign language when you watch our video, coming in 2022!
	<br><br>
	Whilst Matthew knew that he was on a Greater Anglia train, these were basically the only lines in North London that he had no knowledge of. Moreover, the train kept 
	stopping randomly, leaving him no way of knowing how many stations we had passed through. Eventually, James grabbed Matthew, dragged him off the train, and lead him 
	out of the station, but not before having this photo:
</p>

<center><iframe id="medvid" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LwdZyxQyZhU" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
<p>
	Welcome to Enfield Lock! These adventures have taken us to places that are dingy, desolate and even dangerous, but Enfield Lock is a strong contender for the most 
	depressing station we'd ever seen... well, that James had ever seen. Matthew couldn't see shit. The only thing Matthew could see from between the gaps between his fingers 
	was how grim and depressing everything was. It seemed like the end of the world, and the once-per-hour bus and crappy chicken shop being the only signs of civilisation here 
	certainly didn't help. Eventually, the bus turned up, we got on, and the bus wound its way through the backstreets of Enfield Lock, completely ruining Matthew's chances 
	of locating where he was. The bus dumped us in a field, underneath some electricity pylons, not far from the M25. It seemed like the end of the world, and it basically was - 
	we were at the very edge of London. Finally, Matthew took off his blindfold to admire the devastation.
	<br><br>
	<strong>"Where the fuck are you leaving me?"</strong>
	<br><br>
	From this point on, the video can explain what happened much better than I can. We stood in front of the camera, explaining the rules of this stupid challenge, before 
	Matthew stood in a bush, waiting for James to depart on the bus, taking all of his communication and navigation devices, and leaving him for dead in one of the murder 
	capitals of London. Fun! All Matthew had was his oyster card, his mask, some money, a camera, and the name of the destination - Wraysbury.
</p>
<center><iframe id="largevid" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/beZCPkxL6k8" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>
<p>
	James went full pelt, running to the bus and immediately returning to Enfield Lock. Luckily, he caught a train immediately, whisking him back into central London. 
	He zoomed his way down the Victoria line, tried to make some stupid changes (in order to ride the W&C, which was closed - RIP), before heading straight to Waterloo, 
	and getting on an express train to Wraysbury. In roughly an hour, he had reached the tiny country station, and was soon sitting in the Perseverance pub, drinking 
	his cider, content with his victory. He sat in the beer garden, about to take his first sip, when he suddenly thought <strong>'Oh shit. What have I done? What if 
	Matthew is dead?'</strong>. 
	<br><br>
	Matthew was not quite dead, but was wishing he was. He spent over half an hour wandering around the abandoned streets of Enfield Lock, looking for any sign of the 
	train station. He wandered around the fields, down some streets, along the canal, before stumbling across the M25, to Matthew's 'great delight'. 
	<br><br>
	<strong>'Have you left me outside the M25? You bastard!'</strong>
	<br><br>
	Matthew managed to get himself onto a bus, and was soon at Enfield Lock station at last. Here, he had an excellent idea - what if, instead of waiting 25 minutes for the 
	next southbound train, he could instead head northward to Cheshunt and catch a faster southbound train? This was clearly a big brain idea, so Matthew did just that... 
	which failed, as was expected. He ended up catching the same slow train southbound, to Finsbury Park. This section of line is utterly miserable, and we at NT would not be 
	looking forward to it, were it not for the chance to visit Ikea Premier Meridian Water Extra - the best Ikea of them all!
	<br><br>
	Matthew then took the Victoria and Northern lines straight to Waterloo, having discovered the location of Wraysbury on the Greater Anglia train to Cheshunt. He bought 
	himself a ticket, and waited for the next train. Here, Matthew hit yet another stumbling block, and had to catch a slow train to Staines, before changing to the Wraysbury 
	train. Once at the near-abandoned station, he followed the 1 other disembarking passenger, hoping to God that this passenger knew where he was going. After losing all hope, 
	and walking for almost 10 minutes, suddenly Matthew stumbled across 'civilisation' - a village! He was in Wraysbury! And who was there to meet him, but James, who had 
	finally left the pub, worried that after 2 hours apart, Matthew had been stabbed and was bleeding out on some street corner in Enfield. Unfortunately, Matthew was safe 
	and sound, and had finally persevered all the way to the pub (you'd better appreciate all the Mars jokes I made on the SWR train, James - Matthew)
	<br><br>
	Matthew had a half-pint, and James a further pint, before we set off back to the station, filming a guide to the station, before boarding our train back to Waterloo. 
	James spent the entire journey attempting not to piss himself, so when we finally arrived, he was very glad.
	<br><br>
	It was now after-dark, and we were in Central London, so you know what that means - it was walking time! We walked past the London Eye, to James' delight, passed the 
	old County Hall, before walking up the river, up to Embankment. More walking to come later - it was food time first, the most important component of NT! We took the tube 
	all the way to Liverpool St, which was admittedly a slight detour, for we had 1 even more pressing task to tackle - that's right - it was time to begin the final tube 
	line, after 8 long adventures. It was time to take the H&C, to James' complete and utter horror. Taking the H&C? This was surely illegal? Why would we take that line? 
	It was useless - it just mooches off other lines! Yet, under NT rules, it had to be done. We took the H&C for exactly 1 stop to Aldgate East, thereby completing all 
	unique sections of the H&C, in just less than 2 minutes. RIP. That was underwhelming.

	We left the station, now back in East London, and walked up Brick Lane towards our restaurant. James was very much not keen on Brick Lane. Whilst walking up the 
	street, James said 'no' almost as many times as TweetyBoi does when he is having a spasm. Yet, after we sat down, had our food, and were then handed the bill (for 
	which we were overcharged, and grossly overpaid), we ended up <i>both</i> sounding like TweetyBoi. We were not impressed by this at all. See the NT Michelin Guide 
	for our 100% objective assessment of this, and many other fine establishments, from Camborne to 'Druth!
	<br><br>
	It was only about 11pm, and as this was a 3-day Koppa, this was no excuse to end prematurely! It was back to the trains! We took the District all the way to West Ham, 
	striking out eastward one more time, before reaching the station and doubling back, trying to not get stranded out in horrid east London. We returned to the City, and 
	yet again, we decided that the best way to end this long day of NT was on a long and winding walk through the City of London! We returned to the balcony that we had 
	stood on, at 11pm on Brexit Day, thinking of how long ago this was.
	<br><br>
	We walked down to the Tower of London, passing the final section of the Roman Wall, and a statue of Trajan. We then walked across Tower Bridge, with James using up 
	the very last dregs of his camera battery, before his camera offed itself and died... right before we would pass fantastic shots of the river, the City and the Globe 
	Theatre. RIP. Now camera-less, we continued along the South Bank, through Southwark and down to the Millenium Bridge, marching over it in tandem, hoping to induce a 
	resonant frequency. We are sane.
	<br><br>
	By this point, James was angry and tired of walking, so we walked up to St Pauls Cathedral, and down to City Thameslink, where we waited for a bus... for 20 minutes. 
	This also angered James, who was not used to having to wait for transport in London - what was this, Camborne?
	<br><br>
	Eventually, the bus turned up, and Matthew decided that this was a fitting way to end day 2 - fuck Citymapper, we were doing this old school! We were going to hop from 
	bus to bus until we reached Earl's Court! This was actually surprisingly successful. We took the first bus to Charing Cross, and waited no more than 2 minutes for the 
	next bus, which we took to Hyde Park Corner, before jumping off and catching the next bus that turned up, 3 minutes later, all the way to South Kensington. Finally, here, 
	we waited a further 2 minutes before hopping on a 4th and final bus to Earl's Court. 4 Night Buses, no forward planning, and no navigational aid. Yet, we had travelled all 
	the way from the City to Earl's Court in just 33 minutes. Matthew was very pleased with himself.
	<br><br>
	In James' cursed Premier Inn, we watched people shuttle back and forth down the orgy corridor, and watched plenty of clips of our nutty challenge. Finally, after great 
	reluctance, Matthew staggered out of the Premier Inn at gone 3am, catching night buses and walking up Regent Street in the cold and the rain, eventually arriving home.

	By Day 3, we were completely and utterly dead, Matthew especially, who had caught a cold after walking through the cold and the rain the previous night, and now had a 
	very sore throat. Our plans to meet at Earl's Court went out the window, so we instead met at Embankment, where the 
	Bakerloo meets the District, to finish off our tube challenge simulation, and take the District to Upminster. This was a fairly sedate trip, as we'd done most of the 
	District before, and were too kill to do anything else apart from monologue to the camera. We passed through "lovely" East London, and stopped at Dagenham (twice), once 
	the largest council estate in the world, before reaching the end of the District line and almost the edge of London yet again. What was it with this adventure? We had 
	managed to tick off yet another tube line - tick!

	We wandered the station, looking for toilets, tapped out and back in to not get fined yet again for NT antics, and then decided that catching a c2c train 1 stop to Barking 
	would shave off some time. So that is exactly what we did! It was quite nice starting yet another TOC - NT is quite looking forward to heading out towards Southend, 
	Britain's newest city.
	<br><br>
	At Barking, we changed to the H&C to head home, thereby managing to jump from 0% completion of the line to about 80% by the end of this adventure, as we rode the train all 
	the way from its terminus in Barking to Edgware Road, filling in the hardest part of Matthew's map, and making him very happy indeed. We had intended to go further again, 
	and finish the line in one fell swoop, but time was running short, so we abandoned this project for Koppa 9, and took the Circle line to HSK and the District to Earl's Court 
	instead (exploring platform 4 of HSK on the way - it was intriguing). There, James collected his stuff, we bought food [a meal deal ;)] in Sainsbury's, weaved in and out of 
	the various 'people' one encounters in Earl's Court, and we got back on the District, back to PAD.
	<br><br>
	This had been a fairly well-planned end to the adventure by our usual standards - we were still in one piece, were kind of functioning, and even had 10 minutes until James' 
	train! Phwoar, that really was something. But to cap it all off, Matthew whipped out his lunch - perfect for someone with a sore throat - a bag of red hot chili-flavoured 
	Doritos! James made sure to capture this on camera for Mrs Arthur, who was dutifully sent into a tizzy at the thought of this.
	<br><br>
	And with that, the summer of NT was almost kill... apart from the crowning glory, back in <a href="./sampi.html">Markeyland...</a> Tune in for Sampi VII!
