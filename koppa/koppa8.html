	Can Matthew and James pull multiple 12 hour+ tube challenge simulations in succession? Can Matthew find his way across London after being blindfolded and abandoned 
	in a field in Enfield with no phone or map? Can James finally get Matthew to order some cider? Yes. Yes we can.
	<br><br>
	Matthew met James at Earl’s Court then headed up to Chesham. Went to a pub then walked through the park. Went to Amersham followed by Stanmore, before climbing 
	Stanmore Hill, seeing the Futurama streets and reaching Edgware. Went to Quartieri in Brondesbury before ticking off Mill Hill East and High Barnet, before 
	getting separated at Camden Road in the middle of a stupid plan. 
	<br><br>
	Started Day 2 by mopping up the Circle line and repeating last night’s plan to Stratford. Headed up to Epping & Fairlop on the Central line and went to another pub. 
	Matthew blindfolded himself at Stratford and was taken to Enfield Lock, then on a bus, and dumped in a field with no phone. After 2 hours, he found his way to Wraysbury 
	in Surrey, via Cheshunt, Tottenham Hale, Warren Street and Waterloo, and had a half-pint in the pub. James had been sitting there happily for an hour. We wandered 
	around the London Eye and up to Embankment before starting the H&C and having an Indian in City Spice, grossly overpaying. Headed up to West Ham on the District 
	before returning to the City (the balcony), walking over Tower Bridge, through Southwark and over the Millennium Bridge before taking 4 quick night buses to Earls 
	Court in 33 mins. Matthew then staggered home after walking up Regent Street in the cold and the rain. 
	<br><br>
	Finally, on day 3, we headed to Upminster and came back via c2c and the H&C.

<!--These adventures have taken us to places that are dingy, desolate and even dangerous, but Enfield Lock is a strong contender for the most depressing station we'd ever seen-->
