<p>
	And the MathSoc award for nuttiest lunatics goes to: James and Matthew! Congratulations! You embraced your creative sides, with fancy film equipment and 
	off-colour Monty Python rip-offs, met Acton's finest crackheads, played Art Student Bingo<sup>TM</sup>, and sprinted through the shittiest bits of the 
	Docklands! Well Done‚ÄΩ
	<br><br>
	James arrived in PAD at 12:30, and we headed back to Matthew's place in NA, after many months. James unloaded his stuff, and we searched Ffynone‚Äôs 
	Facebook for old photos, caught up, and headed to the roof terrace to film some aerial shots. We practised with the new cameras all the way. Then we headed 
	into London and went straight to Camden: the art student holding pen. We went to Mei Leaf, which James adored. Matthew had Tong Mu, and he had Paradise 
	Pu-erh. Tea Traders retweeted us after we tweeted about this! We walked up through Camden and played Art Student Bingo, then walked through Camden Market. 
	Finally, we returned to the tube and headed to Chinatown, and ordered way too much food in One Plus. We had Fujian special fried rice, Wuhan dry noodles, 
	Gung Pao Chicken and some sides. Freya joined us for this bit. We went to the Chinatown bakery and bought snacks, then parted and headed back to Matthew's. 
	We filmed some MathSoc videos on the roof terrace at night, then took James‚Äôs suitcase to his Premier Inn in Ealing, via 2 buses and the District line, as 
	the Central line was 17 minutes away. James had forgotten his phone, so we returned to Matthew's, walking between moving carriages on the way, then raced 
	off into central London via the night bus! We took the N266 to Hammersmith and the N95 to Trafalgar Square, and filmed some MathSoc videos. We laughed at 
	Uganda and Sadiq‚Äôs traffic lights, then walked down Whitehall, saw OWO and the cenotaph, then doubled back past Downing Street (the guns made James uneasy) 
	and James spat at HMRC. We saw Big Ben, and filmed more MathSoc videos, then walked to Embankment, attempted to get McDonalds but we scared by the large 
	and raucous crowd, so settled for the Co-op. We finally caught the N11 towards Ealing Broadway, put up with a rabble of youths, but when a crackhead sat 
	behind us, we got off at Acton, to find it was already light. James then caught a bus home and Matthew walked. Genbatte NT! 
	<br><br>
	Day 2: James‚Äô SD card fucked itself, so we met up in Ealing Argos to source a new one, before taking the train to Acton Town again and zipping down the 
	Piccadilly to Heathrow T5. We then returned to Hounslow West and filmed clips at the start of the A30 for MathSoc. We then headed to Earls Court and 
	doubled back on the District, where we wandered around the ‚Äòvey nice‚Äô town centre, and went to a pub for a carvery. We walked along the Thames, then 
	returned to the station, and took the Slowverground, Bakerloo and Jubilee to North Greenwich for the Dangleway vs DLR challenge (it was a draw, but 
	Matthew was dead). We filmed some MathSoc clips then headed to the historic site of Woolwich McDonalds, and started the completely bats DLR vs Matthew 
	challenge, which Matthew won conclusively. We took the DLR, Jubilee and Purp to Liverpool St, then completed the top of the Circle line and went to NHG 
	for Pizza Express, which was also very nice. After this we filmed the GeoffIPN shot in Hyde Park, and took the District to Edgware Rd, the Circle to 
	Hammersmith, the Picc to Turnham Green (Tick), and the District to Ealing Broadway. We watched a load of clips, then Matthew walked home.
	<br><br>
	Day 3: we missed the W&C so instead met up to see Trotter Towers! We then were almost murdered by a bloke on the bus, had breakfast in the Premier Inn, then 
	legged it to Ealing Broadway, executing a flying jump into the carriage with a huge suitcase, headed to Paddington, and ended the nuttiest adventure yet!
