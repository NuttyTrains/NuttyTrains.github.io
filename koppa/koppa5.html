	And the MathSoc award for nuttiest lunatics goes to: James and Matthew! Congratulations! You embraced your creative sides, with fancy film equipment and 
	off-colour Monty Python rip-offs, met Acton's finest crackheads, played Art Student Bingo<sup>TM</sup>, and sprinted through the shittiest bits of the

	It was time for another big one! Koppa 5 was go! James set off from Camborne early in the morning with all his worldly possessions - the start of his longest 
	time away from home ever, as he was on his way to Oxford for 4 weeks - with some NT in London on the way. Not that Mrs Arthur knew about this.
	<br><br>
	<strong>Oooh Jamie, no go London. No. Go straight to Oxford, away from chock. Yes. No chock. No London. </strong>
	<br><br>
	So naturally, James got straight on the train to London, packing himself into the gridlocked cattle truck that had turned up at the station, slotting himself 
	in like he was playing a game of Tetris, and immediately ordered a Corona beer.
	<br><br>
	To make everything that much better, the station master asked James where he was going, before the train arrived:<br>
	James: "I am off to Oxford"<br>
	Station Master: "Oh are you a student?"<br>
	James: "Yes..."<br>
	Station Master: "Which college do you study at there?"<br>
	James' Heart: CRITICAL HIT
	<br><br>
	<i>Many panic attacks later...</i>
	<br><br>
	Before long, the train had cracked all along the chassis due to the weight of all the Americans who were in Kernow for the G7, so the train was forced 
	to stop. Fortunately, at the mention of 'crack', all of the other passengers from 'Druth, 'Zance, C'mb'rn and anywhere else on the line immediately threw 
	themselves out of the train windows to try and get some sweet, sweet crack. Unfortunately the only crack they got was the crack of their skulls colliding with 
	the oncoming replacement train. It wasn't all a lost cause - the train had needed a new coat of paint anyway.
	<br><br>
	Meanwhile, Matthew, having fought off the hordes of Scotsmen that had invaded central London on Lady Macbeth's orders, was soon on his way to PAD to meet James, 
	whose train was now slowly grinding its way past Reading at such a pace that James was wondering whether or not a purple train would be faster than his 
	now-red 800, testing out his brand new cameras on the way.

<p>
	At long last, James arrived in PAD at 12:30, only to find that PAD was extremely busy (this seems to happen a lot). He ran into Matthew, and thus Koppa 5 was 
	go! We headed to the Circle-District platforms, and cracked open the first camera, the little pocket-sized one. Cue some test shots of the trains approaching, 
	and MatthewCam<sup>TM</sup>! God, this was bad already, and we had barely started!
	<br><br>
	First task: transport James' worldly belongings back towards Premier Inn Ealing.<br>
	Problem: Premier Inn Ealing was not yet open.<br>
	Solution: Head to Matthew's place in NA for the first ever time, and keep his stuff there!
	<br><br>
	We changed at NHG, listened to the Central line <i>scream</i> its way through the tunnels, and soon arrived back in NA. 
	We headed to Matthew's block, went up in the lift and entered Matthew's flat, which he finally had all to himself. James was rather 
	impressed by the flat, even if it was quite small (Disclaimer: James was only impressed because Matthew's flatmate had gone - James was not impressed by him).
	He unloaded all his stuff, and we caught up for the first time after exams. We then decided to search Ffynone’s Facebook for old photos, mainly of Scott, but 
	also of anyone else amusing. And Jesus there were some good ones. Scott was definitely... a thing.
	<br><br>
	After far too long trawling Ffynone's Facebook page, we headed to the roof terrace on the 23rd floor to break out the big camera and film some aerial shots. 
	Firstly we went to the terrace on the 15th floor, which was enormously high for James. Down in Camborne, they regard any building with more than 3 floors as 
	the work of witchcraft! The view from up there was excellent - but it was about to get much better! We climbed to the 23rd floor, and had a stunning view of 
	central London, and of all our other surroundings. We brought out the big camera for the first time, and started filming anything that came into view - mainly 
	trains on the numerous different lines that cross over one another in Acton. We spent at least 15 minutes up there, filming the central line, slowverground, 
	purp trains and 800s as they all passed #nottrainspotters.
	<br><br>
	We decided to head into London, but first needed to get to the bottom of the building. So naturally we decided to take the stairs - all 23 floors of them.
	Fun. See the <i>whole clip</i> in our video below!
	<br><br>
	<strong>AAAARGH<br>
	Do you like your feet?</strong>
	<br><br>
	We caught the tube into London, filming yet more shit on the way (notice a pattern yet?) and went straight to Camden: the art student holding pen. 
	<i>Aside: from now on, basically assume that <b>doing something</b> ⟹ <b>filming it</b>.</i> We changed at Tottenham Court Road, headed to Camden Town, 
	jumping on and off at every station. We loves NT.
	<br><br>
	We arrived at Camden Town, and immediately felt ill at ease - this was art student territory, and we could sense it. We scuttled quickly towards Mei Leaf, 
	hoping to not be spotted by the hair-dyed hordes. 
	<br><br>
	Now is probably a good time to explain a little NT history. During R<sub>0</sub>=3, back in Summer 2020, we were returning from Pembroke Castle when the 
	train stopped in Carmarthen, thanks to the fucked-up timetable that TfW had implemented. This gave us about an hour to kill, so we headed to a tea shop 
	called Tea Traders, and met the lovely owner, Paul. You can read all about what happened <a href="../r0.html">here</a>, but before we left, Paul recommended 
	to us some tea shops in London, for Matthew to visit in the upcoming year, one of which was Mei Leaf. It had taken us almost a full year, but at long last, 
	we had finally made it, and it certainly did not disappoint! The whole place was filled with authentic Chinese teas and Chinese writing, and even had a Chinese 
	Medicine shop attached (vey nice!). The tea was all served in the traditional way, with a gongfu. 
	
	which James adored. Matthew had Tong Mu, and James had Paradise 
	Pu-erh. Tea Traders retweeted us after we tweeted about this! We walked up through Camden and played Art Student Bingo, then walked through Camden Market. 
	Finally, we returned to the tube and headed to Chinatown, and ordered way too much food in One Plus. We had Fujian special fried rice, Wuhan dry noodles, 
	Gung Pao Chicken and some sides. Freya joined us for this bit. We went to the Chinatown bakery and bought snacks, then parted and headed back to Matthew's. 
	We filmed some MathSoc videos on the roof terrace at night, then took James’s suitcase to his Premier Inn in Ealing, via 2 buses and the District line, as 
	the Central line was 17 minutes away. James had forgotten his phone, so we returned to Matthew's, walking between moving carriages on the way, then raced 
	off into central London via the night bus! We took the N266 to Hammersmith and the N95 to Trafalgar Square, and filmed some MathSoc videos. We laughed at 
	Uganda and Sadiq’s traffic lights, then walked down Whitehall, saw OWO and the cenotaph, then doubled back past Downing Street (the guns made James uneasy) 
	and James spat at HMRC. We saw Big Ben, and filmed more MathSoc videos, then walked to Embankment, attempted to get McDonalds but we scared by the large 
	and raucous crowd, so settled for the Co-op. We finally caught the N11 towards Ealing Broadway, put up with a rabble of youths, but when a crackhead sat 
	behind us, we got off at Acton, to find it was already light. James then caught a bus home and Matthew walked. Genbatte NT! 
	<br><br>
	Day 2: James’ SD card fucked itself, so we met up in Ealing Argos to source a new one, before taking the train to Acton Town again and zipping down the 
	Piccadilly to Heathrow T5. We then returned to Hounslow West and filmed clips at the start of the A30 for MathSoc. We then headed to Earls Court and 
	doubled back on the District to Richmond, where we wandered around the ‘vey nice’ town centre, and went to a pub for a carvery. We walked along the Thames, then 
	returned to the station, and took the Slowverground, Bakerloo and Jubilee to North Greenwich for the Dangleway vs DLR challenge (it was a draw, but 
	Matthew was dead). We filmed some MathSoc clips then headed to the historic site of Woolwich McDonalds, and started the completely bats DLR vs Matthew 
	challenge, which Matthew won conclusively. We took the DLR, Jubilee and Purp to Liverpool St, then completed the top of the Circle line and went to NHG 
	for Pizza Express, which was also very nice. After this we filmed the GeoffIPN shot in Hyde Park, and took the District to Edgware Rd, the Circle to 
	Hammersmith, the Picc to Turnham Green (Tick), and the District to Ealing Broadway. We watched a load of clips, then Matthew walked home.
	<br><br>
	Day 3: we missed the W&C so instead met up to see Trotter Towers! We then were almost murdered by a bloke on the bus, had breakfast in the Premier Inn, then 
	legged it to Ealing Broadway, executing a flying jump into the carriage with a huge suitcase, headed to Paddington, and ended the nuttiest adventure yet!
