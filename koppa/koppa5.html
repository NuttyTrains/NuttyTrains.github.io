	It was time for another big one! Koppa 5 was go! James set off from Camborne early in the morning with all his worldly possessions - the start of his longest 
	time away from home ever, as he was on his way to Oxford for 4 weeks - with some NT in London on the way. Not that Mrs Arthur knew about this.
	<br><br>
	<strong>Oooh Jamie, no go London. No. Go straight to Oxford, away from chock. Yes. No chock. No London. </strong>
	<br><br>
	So naturally, James got straight on the train to London, packing himself into the gridlocked cattle truck that had turned up at the station, slotting himself 
	in like he was playing a game of Tetris, and immediately ordered a Corona beer.
	<br><br>
	To make everything that much better, the station master asked James where he was going, before the train arrived:<br>
	James: "I am off to Oxford"<br>
	Station Master: "Oh are you a student?"<br>
	James: "Yes..."<br>
	Station Master: "Which college do you study at there?"<br>
	James' Heart: CRITICAL HIT
	<br><br>
	<i>Many panic attacks later...</i>
	<br><br>
	Before long, the train had cracked all along the chassis due to the weight of all the Americans who were in Kernow for the G7, so the train was forced 
	to stop. Fortunately, at the mention of 'crack', all of the other passengers from 'Druth, 'Zance, C'mb'rn and anywhere else on the line immediately threw 
	themselves out of the train windows to try and get some sweet, sweet crack. Unfortunately the only crack they got was the crack of their skulls colliding with 
	the oncoming replacement train. It wasn't all a lost cause - the train had needed a new coat of paint anyway.
	<br><br>
	Meanwhile, Matthew, having fought off the hordes of Scotsmen that had invaded central London on Lady Macbeth's orders, was soon on his way to PAD to meet James, 
	whose train was now slowly grinding its way past Reading at such a pace that James was wondering whether or not a purple train would be faster than his 
	now-red 800, testing out his brand new cameras on the way.

	<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </center>
<p>
	At long last, James arrived in PAD at 12:30, only to find that PAD was extremely busy (this seems to happen a lot). He ran into Matthew, and thus Koppa 5 was 
	go! We headed to the Circle-District platforms, and cracked open the first camera, the little pocket-sized one. Cue some test shots of the trains approaching, 
	and MatthewCam<sup>TM</sup>! God, this was bad already, and we had barely started!
	<br><br>
	First task: transport James' worldly belongings back towards Premier Inn Ealing.<br>
	Problem: Premier Inn Ealing was not yet open.<br>
	Solution: Head to Matthew's place in NA for the first ever time, and keep his stuff there!
	<br><br>
	We changed at NHG, listened to the Central line <i>scream</i> its way through the tunnels, and soon arrived back in NA. 
	We headed to Matthew's block, went up in the lift and entered Matthew's flat, which he finally had all to himself. James was rather 
	impressed by the flat, even if it was quite small (Disclaimer: James was only impressed because Matthew's flatmate had gone - James was not impressed by him).
	He unloaded all his stuff, and we caught up for the first time after exams. We then decided to search Ffynone‚Äôs Facebook for old photos, mainly of Scott, but 
	also of anyone else amusing. And Jesus there were some good ones. Scott was definitely... a thing.
	<br><br>
	After far too long trawling Ffynone's Facebook page, Matthew gave James his birthday presents - an SWR macintosh, a Taiwanese tea set and a travel guide to 
	China, which James really appreciated. Then we headed to the roof terrace on the 23rd floor to break out the big camera and film some aerial shots. 
	Firstly we went to the terrace on the 15th floor, which was enormously high for James. Down in Camborne, they regard any building with more than 3 floors as 
	the work of witchcraft! The view from up there was excellent - but it was about to get much better! We climbed to the 23rd floor, and had a stunning view of 
	central London, and of all our other surroundings. We brought out the big camera for the first time, and started filming anything that came into view - mainly 
	trains on the numerous different lines that cross over one another in Acton. We spent at least 15 minutes up there, filming the central line, slowverground, 
	purp trains and 800s as they all passed #nottrainspotters.
	<br><br>
	We decided to head into London, but first needed to get to the bottom of the building. So naturally we decided to take the stairs - all 23 floors of them.
	Fun. See the <i>whole clip</i> in our video below!
	<br><br>
	<strong>AAAARGH<br>
	Do you like your feet?</strong>

<p>
	We caught the tube into London, filming yet more shit on the way (notice a pattern yet?) and went straight to Camden: the art student holding pen. 
	<i>Aside: from now on, basically assume that <b>doing something</b> ‚üπ <b>filming it</b>.</i> We changed at Tottenham Court Road, headed to Camden Town, 
	jumping on and off at every station. We loves NT.
	<br><br>
	We arrived at Camden Town, and immediately felt ill at ease - this was art student territory, and we could sense it. We scuttled quickly towards Mei Leaf, 
	hoping to not be spotted by the hair-dyed hordes. 
	<br><br>
	Now is probably a good time to explain a little NT history. During R<sub>0</sub>=3, back in Summer 2020, we were returning from Pembroke Castle when the 
	train stopped in Carmarthen, thanks to the fucked-up timetable that TfW had implemented. This gave us about an hour to kill, so we headed to a tea shop 
	called Tea Traders, and met the lovely owner, Paul. You can read all about what happened <a href="../r0.html">here</a>, but before we left, Paul recommended 
	to us some tea shops in London, for Matthew to visit in the upcoming year, one of which was Mei Leaf. It had taken us almost a full year, but at long last, 
	we had finally made it, and it certainly did not disappoint! The whole place was filled with authentic Chinese teas and Chinese writing, and even had a Chinese 
	Medicine shop attached (vey nice!). The tea was all served in the traditional way. We ordered then headed in and perched on the side of someone else's table, 
	before moving over to a seat by the window. Matthew ordered Tong Mu, essentially an unsmoked Lapsang, and James had Paradise Pu-erh. Both our teas were absolutely 
	delicious, to the point that we each ended up buying some tea to take home. We took plenty of photos and videos of the tea, which was enormously aesthetic, and 
	hopefully some of these clips survive. We tweeted some of the best photos on the NT account, and to our absolute delight, we were retweeted by Tea Traders!

<p> 
	
	We then left and walked up into Camden town centre itself, leaving Matthew quaking with fear - we were entering art student territory, and Matthew was deeply 
	worried that his allergies would start acting up! Camden was filled with all sorts of weird shops to entice art students into the jaws of capitalism, where they 
	could go and spend daddy's money. Even more diverse than the range of shops we saw on the high street was the range of tell-tale signs that we had entered an art 
	student enclave: truly this was worse than Falmouth! But this gave us an idea:
	<br><br>
	The interesting thing is what we did in Camden: so when we arrived there, we came up with a game, and this was a brilliant game; the best game. It was called Art 
	Student Bingo<sup>TM</sup>. And it involved... bingo, basically. But instead of calling out numbers, like you do with normal bingo, what you had to do here was look 
	at your bingo card and work out what you could see when walking through Camden. So I think I've got one of the cards (let me bring it up) over here - there you are; 
	it is probably going to go about here: ‚áì. Now it is going to just about appear - so you can see it's got dyed hair on it, it's got Pret, it's got mummy and daddy's 
	money, uhh, it's got anti-capitalist sticker, that type of thing. But you just go through Camden, and you find how many of these you can tick off. Both Matthew and I 
	ticked them off very quickly. It's a brilliant game; one of the best. Give it a go. *awkward smile* 
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Art Student Bingo.png" width="40%"></center>
<p>
	Playing Art Student Bingo is so easy in Camden that we managed to tick off everything on the score-card before we'd even made it to Camden Market, down in 
	some old disused buildings near the canal. This was the Arrrt Stud'n 'Oldin Pen, oooh arrgh! Every kind of artisan stall or organic crap that art students 
	love was being sold here. Matthew felt deeply uncomfortable being surrounded by so many of them, so we didn't stay very long - one disdainful lap of the 
	place, attempting to not spit at them, before leaving and returning back through the hordes outside the vegan food shop, vintage clothing store and Pret, back 
	towards the tube.
	<br><br>
	It was roughly dinner time, so we headed to Chinatown, changing at Leicester Square and getting off at Piccadilly Circus. This time we decided to head into 
	a restaurant called One Plus. Freya had said she would come along, so we decided to order for 3 people. Unfortunately, Freya decided to refuse to eat 
	anything, so we ended up ordering an absolutely exorbitant amount of food for 2 people, including Fujian special fried rice, Wuhan dry noodles, 
	Gung Pao Chicken and some sides. Essentially we ended up eating one dish each (oh wow, how strange - imagine a world where each person orders their own main!) - 
	Matthew mainly had the Fuijian noodles, a) because he was on a Fujianese kick after his tea, and b) because everyone else refused to touch the squid noodles. 
	James ended up eating the Wuhan noodles, and Freya picked at the Gung Pao chicken. Here, James had an amusing experience with the staff when asking for directions 
	to the toilet, as neither could understand the other, either in English or Chinese, causing Freya to cringe in embarrassment.
	<br><br>
	<strong>"These Wuhan noodles could do with some more bat!"</strong>
	<br><br>
	We went to the Chinatown bakery and bought lots of snacks after our already too-large meal, before walking back through Chinatown. Here, enjoy this iconic clip 
	of us walking through Chinatown, set to some completely original NT Music:
</p>
<center><iframe frameborder="0" height="720px" width="1280px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2DQodnA3esE" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>
<p>
	After this we parted, and the 2 of us headed back towards Matthew's flat in North Acton once more. 
	<br><br>
	The original idea here had been to quickly grab James' stuff and head straight to Ealing Broadway, where James' Premier Inn was. Unfortunately, we got 
	distracted again. We headed back up to the roof terrace, this time in the dark, with the bright lights of the City behind us, and decided that this was 
	the perfect location to film the first 2021 MathSoc award video - 18 storeys up, at 11pm at night, in Acton. Lovely Jubbly!
	<br><br>
	After tearing James away from becoming a full trainspotter as he insisted on filming yet more trains beneath us, we then grabbed his stuff and headed down 
	to the tube. Unfortunately, as we headed down to the platform, we encountered a problem: the tube was kill. The next train was in 17 minutes. Quite frankly, 
	it was cold, Matthew was impatient, and we had better things to do on an NT adventure, so Matthew came up with a new plan on the fly: it was bus time!
	<br><br>
	We walked over to the edge of the dodgy little council estate in the shadow of the towers and waited for our first bus there, before jumping on and taking it 
	down, past AML, into Acton town centre (trust me, by the end of this adventure, we'd been on almost every bus passing through Acton town centre). We changed 
	to a new bus to take us down to Acton Town tube station (not to be confused with Acton town centre or Acton Central station in Acton town centre).
	<br><br>
	By the end of this magical mystery tour through Acton, James was quite frustrated at having to have carried all his worldly belongings all this way, and 
	was even more frustrated when we ended up having to wait a stupid amount of time at Acton Town for the next District train to Ealing Broadway. Fun.
	<br><br>
	We arrived at Ealing Broadway, walked to the Premier Inn and checked in after an interesting conversation with the hotel staff who did not believe James 
	when he was trying to explain that he was from Cornwall, and that Cornwall is part of the UK - Mebyon Kernow! James was given the same room as every single 
	time he stayed there, which was basically a second home by this point.
	<br><br>
	Unfortunately, we discovered at this point that	James had forgotten his phone, so we returned to Ealing Broadway to head back to Matthew's room to check 
	there. Here, as the train was leaving the station, we decided it would be a capital idea to ignore the "Danger of Death" signs, and start walking between 
	the moving carriages on the way. Unfortunately, as with so many other amazing clips, this particular clip may or may not survive. We will have to find out 
	in 10 years time, when James finally sorts his SD card, when we will be old enough to regret all of this. *pain* 
	<br><br>
	Nevertheless; walking between moving carriages on the central line: TICK!
	<br><br>
	We arrived at Matthew's, found James' phone, and then discussed our next plan of action. Neither of us were yet tired, so we wanted to keep going, but there 
	was a minor problem with this - the tube had now stopped. Ah. Fortunately, a solution presented itself as we stepped out onto the street - the night bus! So it 
	was to be! We hopped on and raced off into central London via the night bus! We firstly took the N266 to Hammersmith. Here we filmed possibly the best ever MathSoc 
	video of all time, sitting on the front seats on the top deck of the night bus, as we drove through glorious Acton. Whilst this clip is no longer with us, I'd 
	just like to say that the thing that quite simply made that clip was passing a petrol station right at the end. It was *chefs kiss*. 
	<br><br>
	We changed at Hammersmith, which is an enormously fucked-up bus station, with an <i>upper floor</i> of bays. This confused the poor Cornishman sitting on the 
	bus with Matthew. In Camborne, bus stations are lucky to have 1 floor! Back in Kernow, most of them have no floors!
	<br><br>
	We took the N95 to Trafalgar Square, arriving late at night. We laughed at the "art" at Trafalgar Square, made fun of Uganda and questioned Sadiq‚Äôs traffic lights, 
	before starting to walk down Whitehall, where Sir Humphrey lives.
	<br><br>
	<strong>
	"We at Nutty Trains have a great appreciation for art"<br>
	"- and all the creative industries"<br>
	*spits*<br>
	"TRAFFIC CONE TIME!"<br>
	"Oh what is that?"
	</strong>
	Then, we stumbled across the most glorious sight of them all. Truly, this was one of the most amazing things we have ever laid eyes on during NT:
	<br><br>
	The OWO
	<br><br>
	<strong>REDACTED by TweetyBoi x</strong>
	<br><br>
	We walked past the Cenotaph and then passed Downing Street. James wanted to meet Bowis very much, so we crossed the street just before we reached the Houses of 
	Parliament, and started walking up towards Bowis. Matthew tried to warn James that he couldn't simply waltz into Downing Street, and that it would be protected 
	by armed guards, but James dismissed these concerns and walked straight up towards the gate... only to immediately find 3 armed policemen with machine guns facing 
	back at him. White as a ghost, he kept on walking, away from his own death.
	<br><br>
	<strong>"I didn't realised they'd have guns - I thought it would just be some bobbies with batons!"</strong>
	<br><br>
	So naturally James was enormously pleased to find that in order to reach Big Ben we'd have to double back past the men with machine guns :)
	<br><br>
	We passed Her Majesty's Robbers and Charlatans, and spat at them with great vigour, before arriving outside Big Ben. Still shrouded in scaffolding, Big Ben looked a 
	little worse for wear, but looked a lot better than he had done on earlier Koppa adventures. This time the scaffolding was beginning to descend, and the new blue paint 
	on the clock face was visible for the first time, which was very cool.
	<br><br>
	<strong>"Iz ben"</strong>
	<br><br>
	This was surely going to be an excellent place to film a MathSoc clip! Encouraged, we walked over to the embankment and stood by the James, camera angled up at Big Ben, 
	whilst James began his delivery. But then, disaster struck. An disaster of unimaginable proportions... the camera ate the SD card. Entirely. Completely. Every single 
	clip we had filmed on there over the last few hours had been corrupted so badly that we have still not been able to recover any of the lost footage. This was a tragedy 
	never before seen on NT, and I feel as if I must mark it appropriately:
	<br><br>
	FFFFFFFFF<br>
	FFFFFFFFF<br>
	FFF<br>
	FFF<br>
	FFFFFFFFF<br>
	FFFFFFFFF<br>
	FFF<br>
	FFF<br>
	FFF<br>
	FFF
	<br><br>
	Nursing our broken SD card, we walked along to Embankment, and decided to attempt to get some food, as James was now completely and utterly starving, as it had now 
	been a full 15 minutes without food. Unfortunately, post-chock, most 24/7 places ceased to be 24/7, so the nearest open place was McDonalds in Charing Cross. When we 
	had finally walked up to there, we found it absolutely heaving with young club-goers, fighting and having sex with one another, in a large and raucous crowd, so we 
	refused to go in and found a Co-op for our nutritional needs instead.
	<br><br>
	Now feeling more than a little scared by the nightlife in London, and wondering whether he had made a smart life choice in ignoring his mum and coming to London, he 
	wanted to head back to the Premier Inn, so we stood at the increasingly full bus stop for 15 minutes, as James cautiously eyed the growing crowd, before catching the 
	N11 towards Ealing Broadway, which was going to take a full hour to get there, to James' shock. The journey was initally quiet, but this changed when a rabble of 
	youths boarded in Chelsea, and stayed on until Hammersmith. We just about managed to put up with them. Yet when we were having a nice conversation about how Kevin was 
	asking for ¬£10M in research money to pay him and 1 PhD student to sit at home all day, a crackhead sat behind us and started to inanely reply to our conversation, making 
	us both quite uncomfortable, and making James so scared that he wanted to disembark immediately. Hence, we got off at Acton (again), and found it was already light. RIP. 
	This was definitely going to be an enormously long adventure if Day 1 only ended at 5am. We were both tired out of our minds and wanted to get back before it was well 
	and truly daytime, so James caught a bus back to Ealing and Matthew walked home, ready for 3 hours of sleep before Day 2! Genbatte NT!

	Day 2 started fairly bright and early, given that we were on 3 hours sleep and had only arrived home at 5am the previous night. James‚Äô SD card had fucked 
	itself so badly last night that he was unable to recover anything from it, so our first meeting point that morning was on Ealing Broadway (the street), after both 
	having breakfast and coffee, to head to Ealing Argos to source a new SD Card.
	<br><br>
	Then, we were off to the trains! Firstly, in a reversal of last night, it was back to Acton Town again, before zipping down the 
	Piccadilly to Heathrow T5, jumping on and off at every station along the way, a 'nice' and 'relaxing' start to the morning.
	<br><br>
	<strong>"Nothing's ever a problem on Nutty Trains"</strong> - James, 2021
	<br><br>
	We spent a while wandering around the various Heathrow stations, trying to find out whether there was any way to get to Heathrow T4, where both of us had 
	seperately stayed in the Premier Inn there, but Terminal 4 was kill. It turns out that James stayed in T4 during Aleph 5, as Big Blue is headquartered nearby. 
	You might someday be able to read that account, but quite frankly, my account for that adventure is 1000% better than 'reality'. 
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Heathrow T5.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	We then returned to Hounslow West and filmed clips at the start of the A30 for MathSoc. We then headed to Earls Court and 
	doubled back on the District to Richmond, where we wandered around the ‚Äòvey nice‚Äô town centre, and went to a pub for a carvery. We walked along the Thames, then 
	returned to the station, and took the Slowverground, Bakerloo and Jubilee to North Greenwich for the Dangleway vs DLR challenge (it was a draw, but 
	Matthew was dead). We filmed some MathSoc clips then headed to the historic site of Woolwich McDonalds, and started the completely bats DLR vs Matthew 
	challenge, which Matthew won conclusively. We took the DLR, Jubilee and Purp to Liverpool St, then completed the top of the Circle line and went to NHG 
	for Pizza Express, which was also very nice. After this we filmed the GeoffIPN shot in Hyde Park, and took the District to Edgware Rd, the Circle to 
	Hammersmith, the Picc to Turnham Green (Tick), and the District to Ealing Broadway. We watched a load of clips, then Matthew walked home.
	<br><br>
	Day 3: we missed the W&C so instead met up to see Trotter Towers! We then were almost murdered by a bloke on the bus, had breakfast in the Premier Inn, then 
	legged it to Ealing Broadway, executing a flying jump into the carriage with a huge suitcase, headed to Paddington, and ended the nuttiest adventure yet!
