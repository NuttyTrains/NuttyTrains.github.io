<p>
	And the MathSoc award for nuttiest lunatics goes to: James and Matthew! Congratulations! You embraced your creative sides, with fancy film equipment and 
	off-colour Monty Python rip-offs, met Acton's finest crackheads, played Art Student Bingo<sup>TM</sup>, and sprinted through the shittiest bits of the 
	Docklands! Well Done‚ÄΩ

	It was time for another big one! Koppa 5 was go! James set off from Camborne early in the morning with all his worldly possessions - the start of his longest 
	time away from home ever, as he was on his way to Oxford for 4 weeks - with some NT in London on the way. Not that Mrs Arthur knew about this.
	<br><br>
	<strong>Oooh Jamie, no go London. No. Go straight to Oxford, away from chock. Yes. No chock. No London. </strong>
	<br><br>
	So naturally, James got straight on the train to London, packing himself into the gridlocked cattle truck that had turned up at the station, slotting himself 
	in like he was playing a game of Tetris, and immediately ordered a Corona beer.
	<br><br>
	To make everything that much better, the station master asked James where he was going, before the train arrived:<br>
	James: "I am off to Oxford"<br>
	Station Master: "Oh are you a student?"<br>
	James: "Yes..."<br>
	Station Master: "Which college do you study at there?"<br>
	James' Heart: CRITICAL HIT
	<br><br>
	<i>Many panic attacks later...</i>
	<br><br>
	Before long, the train had cracked all along the chassis due to the weight of all the Americans who were in Kernow for the G7, so the train was forced 
	to stop. Fortunately, at the mention of 'crack', all of the other passengers from 'Druth, 'Zance, C'mb'rn and anywhere else on the line immediately threw 
	themselves out of the train windows to try and get some sweet, sweet crack. Unfortunately the only crack they got was the crack of their skulls colliding with 
	the oncoming replacement train. It wasn't all a lost cause - the train had needed a new coat of paint anyway.
	<br><br>
	Meanwhile, Matthew, having fought off the hordes of Scotsmen that had invaded central London on Lady Macbeth's orders, was soon on his way to PAD to meet James, 
	whose train was now slowly grinding its way past Reading at such a pace that James was wondering whether or not a purple train would be faster than his 
	now-red 800, testing out his brand new cameras on the way.

	<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </center>
<p>
	At long last, James arrived in PAD at 12:30, only to find that PAD was extremely busy (this seems to happen a lot). He ran into Matthew, and thus Koppa 5 was 
	go! We headed to the Circle-District platforms, and cracked open the first camera, the little pocket-sized one. Cue some test shots of the trains approaching, 
	and MatthewCam<sup>TM</sup>! God, this was bad already, and we had barely started!
	<br><br>
	First task: transport James' worldly belongings back towards Premier Inn Ealing.<br>
	Problem: Premier Inn Ealing was not yet open.<br>
	Solution: Head to Matthew's place in NA for the first ever time, and keep his stuff there!
	<br><br>
	We changed at NHG, listened to the Central line <i>scream</i> its way through the tunnels, and soon arrived back in NA. 
	We headed to Matthew's block, went up in the lift and entered Matthew's flat, which he finally had all to himself. James was rather 
	impressed by the flat, even if it was quite small (Disclaimer: James was only impressed because Matthew's flatmate had gone - James was not impressed by him).
	He unloaded all his stuff, and we caught up for the first time after exams. We then decided to search Ffynone‚Äôs Facebook for old photos, mainly of Scott, but 
	also of anyone else amusing. And Jesus there were some good ones. Scott was definitely... a thing.
	<br><br>
	After far too long trawling Ffynone's Facebook page, Matthew gave James his birthday presents - an SWR macintosh, a Taiwanese tea set and a travel guide to 
	China, which James really appreciated. Then we headed to the roof terrace on the 23rd floor to break out the big camera and film some aerial shots. 
	Firstly we went to the terrace on the 15th floor, which was enormously high for James. Down in Camborne, they regard any building with more than 3 floors as 
	the work of witchcraft! The view from up there was excellent - but it was about to get much better! We climbed to the 23rd floor, and had a stunning view of 
	central London, and of all our other surroundings. We brought out the big camera for the first time, and started filming anything that came into view - mainly 
	trains on the numerous different lines that cross over one another in Acton. We spent at least 15 minutes up there, filming the central line, slowverground, 
	purp trains and 800s as they all passed #nottrainspotters.
	<br><br>
	We decided to head into London, but first needed to get to the bottom of the building. So naturally we decided to take the stairs - all 23 floors of them.
	Fun. See the <i>whole clip</i> in our video below!
	<br><br>
	<strong>AAAARGH<br>
	Do you like your feet?</strong>

<p>
	We caught the tube into London, filming yet more shit on the way (notice a pattern yet?) and went straight to Camden: the art student holding pen. 
	<i>Aside: from now on, basically assume that <b>doing something</b> ‚üπ <b>filming it</b>.</i> We changed at Tottenham Court Road, headed to Camden Town, 
	jumping on and off at every station. We loves NT.
	<br><br>
	We arrived at Camden Town, and immediately felt ill at ease - this was art student territory, and we could sense it. We scuttled quickly towards Mei Leaf, 
	hoping to not be spotted by the hair-dyed hordes. 
	<br><br>
	Now is probably a good time to explain a little NT history. During R<sub>0</sub>=3, back in Summer 2020, we were returning from Pembroke Castle when the 
	train stopped in Carmarthen, thanks to the fucked-up timetable that TfW had implemented. This gave us about an hour to kill, so we headed to a tea shop 
	called Tea Traders, and met the lovely owner, Paul. You can read all about what happened <a href="../r0.html">here</a>, but before we left, Paul recommended 
	to us some tea shops in London, for Matthew to visit in the upcoming year, one of which was Mei Leaf. It had taken us almost a full year, but at long last, 
	we had finally made it, and it certainly did not disappoint! The whole place was filled with authentic Chinese teas and Chinese writing, and even had a Chinese 
	Medicine shop attached (vey nice!). The tea was all served in the traditional way. We ordered then headed in and perched on the side of someone else's table, 
	before moving over to a seat by the window. Matthew ordered Tong Mu, essentially an unsmoked Lapsang, and James had Paradise Pu-erh. Both our teas were absolutely 
	delicious, to the point that we each ended up buying some tea to take home. We took plenty of photos and videos of the tea, which was enormously aesthetic, and 
	hopefully some of these clips survive. We tweeted some of the best photos on the NT account, and to our absolute delight, we were retweeted by Tea Traders!

	We then left and walked up into Camden town centre itself, leaving Matthew quaking with fear - we were entering art student territory, and Matthew was deeply 
	worried that his allergies would start acting up! Camden was filled with all sorts of weird shops to entice art students into the jaws of capitalism, where they 
	could go and spend daddy's money. Even more diverse than the range of shops we saw on the high street was the range of tell-tale signs that we had entered an art 
	student enclave: truly this was worse than Falmouth! But this gave us an idea:
	<br><br>
	The interesting thing is what we did in Camden: so when we arrived there, we came up with a game, and this was a brilliant game; the best game. It was called Art 
	Student Bingo<sup>TM</sup>. And it involved... bingo, basically. But instead of calling out numbers, like you do with normal bingo, what you had to do here was look 
	at your bingo card and work out what you could see when walking through Camden. So I think I've got one of the cards (let me bring it up) over here - there you are; 
	it is probably going to go about here: ‚áì. Now it is going to just about appear - so you can see it's got dyed hair on it, it's got Pret, it's got mummy and daddy's 
	money, uhh, it's got anti-capitalist sticker, that type of thing. But you just go through Camden, and you find how many of these you can tick off. Both Matthew and I 
	ticked them off very quickly. It's a brilliant game; one of the best. Give it a go. *awkward smile* 
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Art Student Bingo.png" width="40%"></center>
<p>
	Playing Art Student Bingo is so easy in Camden that we managed to tick off everything on the score-card before we'd even made it to Camden Market, down in 
	some old disused buildings near the canal. This was the Arrrt Stud'n 'Oldin Pen, oooh arrgh! Every kind of artisan stall or organic crap that art students 
	love was being sold here. Matthew felt deeply uncomfortable being surrounded by so many of them, so we didn't stay very long - one disdainful lap of the 
	place, attempting to not spit at them, before leaving and returning back through the hordes outside the vegan food shop, vintage clothing store and Pret, back 
	towards the tube.
	<br><br>
	It was roughly dinner time, so we headed to Chinatown, changing at Leicester Square and getting off at Piccadilly Circus. This time we decided to head into 
	a restaurant called One Plus. Freya had said she would come along, so we decided to order for 3 people. Unfortunately, Freya decided to refuse to eat 
	anything, so we ended up ordering an absolutely exorbitant amount of food for 2 people, including Fujian special fried rice, Wuhan dry noodles, 
	Gung Pao Chicken and some sides. Essentially we ended up eating one dish each (oh wow, how strange - imagine a world where each person orders their own main!) - 
	Matthew mainly had the Fuijian noodles, a) because he was on a Fujianese kick after his tea, and b) because everyone else refused to touch the squid noodles. 
	James ended up eating the Wuhan noodles, and Freya picked at the Gung Pao chicken. Here, James had an amusing experience with the staff when asking for directions 
	to the toilet, as neither could understand the other, either in English or Chinese, causing Freya to cringe in embarrassment.
	<br><br>
	<strong>"These Wuhan noodles could do with some more bat!"</strong>
	<br><br>
	We went to the Chinatown bakery and bought lots of snacks after our already too-large meal, before walking back through Chinatown. Here, enjoy this iconic clip 
	of us walking through Chinatown, set to some completely original NT Music:
</p>
<center><iframe id="largevid" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2DQodnA3esE" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>
<p>
	After this we parted, and the 2 of us headed back towards Matthew's flat in North Acton once more. 
	<br><br>
	The original idea here had been to quickly grab James' stuff and head straight to Ealing Broadway, where James' Premier Inn was. Unfortunately, we got 
	distracted again. We headed back up to the roof terrace, this time in the dark, with the bright lights of the City behind us, and decided that this was 
	the perfect location to film the first 2021 MathSoc award video - 18 storeys up, at 11pm at night, in Acton. Lovely Jubbly!
	<br><br>
	After tearing James away from becoming a full trainspotter as he insisted on filming yet more trains beneath us, we then grabbed his stuff and headed down 
	to the tube. Unfortunately, as we headed down to the platform, we encountered a problem: the tube was kill. The next train was in 17 minutes. Quite frankly, 
	it was cold, Matthew was impatient, and we had better things to do on an NT adventure, so Matthew came up with a new plan on the fly: it was bus time!
	<br><br>
	We walked over to the edge of the dodgy little council estate in the shadow of the towers and waited for our first bus there, before jumping on and taking it 
	down, past AML, into Acton town centre (trust me, by the end of this adventure, we'd been on almost every bus passing through Acton town centre). We changed 
	to a new bus to take us down to Acton Town tube station (not to be confused with Acton town centre or Acton Central station in Acton town centre).
	<br><br>
	By the end of this magical mystery tour through Acton, James was quite frustrated at having to have carried all his worldly belongings all this way, and 
	was even more frustrated when we ended up having to wait a stupid amount of time at Acton Town for the next District train to Ealing Broadway. Fun.
	<br><br>
	We arrived at Ealing Broadway, walked to the Premier Inn and checked in after an interesting conversation with the hotel staff who did not believe James 
	when he was trying to explain that he was from Cornwall, and that Cornwall is part of the UK - Mebyon Kernow! James was given the same room as every single 
	time he stayed there, which was basically a second home by this point.
	<br><br>
	Unfortunately, we discovered at this point that	James had forgotten his phone, so we returned to Ealing Broadway to head back to Matthew's room to check 
	there. Here, as the train was leaving the station, we decided it would be a capital idea to ignore the "Danger of Death" signs, and start walking between 
	the moving carriages on the way. Unfortunately, as with so many other amazing clips, this particular clip may or may not survive. We will have to find out 
	in 10 years time, when James finally sorts his SD card, when we will be old enough to regret all of this. *pain* 
	<br><br>
	Nevertheless; walking between moving carriages on the central line: TICK!
	<br><br>
	We arrived at Matthew's, found James' phone, and then discussed our next plan of action. Neither of us were yet tired, so we wanted to keep going, but there 
	was a minor problem with this - the tube had now stopped. Ah. Fortunately, a solution presented itself as we stepped out onto the street - the night bus! So it 
	was to be! We hopped on and raced off into central London via the night bus! We firstly took the N266 to Hammersmith. Here we filmed possibly the best ever MathSoc 
	video of all time, sitting on the front seats on the top deck of the night bus, as we drove through glorious Acton. Whilst this clip is no longer with us, I'd 
	just like to say that the thing that quite simply made that clip was passing a petrol station right at the end. It was *chefs kiss*. 
	<br><br>
	We changed at Hammersmith, which is an enormously fucked-up bus station, with an <i>upper floor</i> of bays. This confused the poor Cornishman sitting on the 
	bus with Matthew. In Camborne, bus stations are lucky to have 1 floor! Back in Kernow, most of them have no floors!
	<br><br>
	We took the N95 to Trafalgar Square, arriving late at night. We laughed at the "art" at Trafalgar Square, made fun of Uganda and questioned Sadiq‚Äôs traffic lights, 
	before starting to walk down Whitehall, where Sir Humphrey lives.
	<br><br>
	<strong>
	"We at Nutty Trains have a great appreciation for art"<br>
	"- and all the creative industries"<br>
	*spits*<br>
	"TRAFFIC CONE TIME!"<br>
	"Oh what is that?"
	</strong>
	Then, we stumbled across the most glorious sight of them all. Truly, this was one of the most amazing things we have ever laid eyes on during NT:
	<br><br>
	The OWO
	<br><br>
	<strong>REDACTED by TweetyBoi x</strong>
	<br><br>
	We walked past the Cenotaph and then passed Downing Street. James wanted to meet Bowis very much, so we crossed the street just before we reached the Houses of 
	Parliament, and started walking up towards Bowis. Matthew tried to warn James that he couldn't simply waltz into Downing Street, and that it would be protected 
	by armed guards, but James dismissed these concerns and walked straight up towards the gate... only to immediately find 3 armed policemen with machine guns facing 
	back at him. White as a ghost, he kept on walking, away from his own death.
	<br><br>
	<strong>"I didn't realised they'd have guns - I thought it would just be some bobbies with batons!"</strong>
	<br><br>
	So naturally James was enormously pleased to find that in order to reach Big Ben we'd have to double back past the men with machine guns :)
	<br><br>
	We passed Her Majesty's Robbers and Charlatans, and spat at them with great vigour, before arriving outside Big Ben. Still shrouded in scaffolding, Big Ben looked a 
	little worse for wear, but looked a lot better than he had done on earlier Koppa adventures. This time the scaffolding was beginning to descend, and the new blue paint 
	on the clock face was visible for the first time, which was very cool.
	<br><br>
	<strong>"Iz ben"</strong>
	<br><br>
	This was surely going to be an excellent place to film a MathSoc clip! Encouraged, we walked over to the embankment and stood by the James, camera angled up at Big Ben, 
	whilst James began his delivery. But then, disaster struck. An disaster of unimaginable proportions... the camera ate the SD card. Entirely. Completely. Every single 
	clip we had filmed on there over the last few hours had been corrupted so badly that we have still not been able to recover any of the lost footage. This was a tragedy 
	never before seen on NT, and I feel as if I must mark it appropriately:
	<br><br>
	FFFFFFFFF<br>
	FFFFFFFFF<br>
	FFF<br>
	FFF<br>
	FFFFFFFFF<br>
	FFFFFFFFF<br>
	FFF<br>
	FFF<br>
	FFF<br>
	FFF
	<br><br>
	Nursing our broken SD card, we walked along to Embankment, and decided to attempt to get some food, as James was now completely and utterly starving, as it had now 
	been a full 15 minutes without food. Unfortunately, post-chock, most 24/7 places ceased to be 24/7, so the nearest open place was McDonalds in Charing Cross. When we 
	had finally walked up to there, we found it absolutely heaving with young club-goers, fighting and having sex with one another, in a large and raucous crowd, so we 
	refused to go in and found a Co-op for our nutritional needs instead.
	<br><br>
	Now feeling more than a little scared by the nightlife in London, and wondering whether he had made a smart life choice in ignoring his mum and coming to London, he 
	wanted to head back to the Premier Inn, so we stood at the increasingly full bus stop for 15 minutes, as James cautiously eyed the growing crowd, before catching the 
	N11 towards Ealing Broadway, which was going to take a full hour to get there, to James' shock. The journey was initally quiet, but this changed when a rabble of 
	youths boarded in Chelsea, and stayed on until Hammersmith. We just about managed to put up with them. Yet when we were having a nice conversation about how Kevin was 
	asking for ¬£10M in research money to pay him and 1 PhD student to sit at home all day, a crackhead sat behind us and started to inanely reply to our conversation, making 
	us both quite uncomfortable, and making James so scared that he wanted to disembark immediately. Hence, we got off at Acton (again), and found it was already light. RIP. 
	This was definitely going to be an enormously long adventure if Day 1 only ended at 5am. We were both tired out of our minds and wanted to get back before it was well 
	and truly daytime, so James caught a bus back to Ealing and Matthew walked home (seeing a cat en route), ready for 3 hours of sleep before Day 2! Genbatte NT! 
</p>

	<a href="https://twitter.com/NuttyTrains/status/1406592756651286529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p>
	Day 2 started fairly bright and early, given that we were on 3 hours sleep and had only arrived home at 5am the previous night. James‚Äô SD card had fucked 
	itself so badly last night that he was unable to recover anything from it, so our first meeting point that morning was on Ealing Broadway (the street), after both 
	having breakfast and coffee, to head to Ealing Argos to source a new SD Card.
	<br><br>
	Then, we were off to the trains! Firstly, in a reversal of last night, it was back to Acton Town again, before zipping down the 
	Piccadilly to Heathrow T5, jumping on and off at every station along the way, a 'nice' and 'relaxing' start to the morning.
	<br><br>
	<strong>"Nothing's ever a problem on Nutty Trains"</strong> - James, 2021
	<br><br>
	We spent a while wandering around the various Heathrow stations, trying to find out whether there was any way to get to Heathrow T4, where both of us had 
	seperately stayed in the Premier Inn there, but Terminal 4 was kill. It turns out that James stayed in T4 during Aleph 5, as Big Blue is headquartered nearby. 
	You might someday be able to read that account, but quite frankly, my account for that adventure is 1000% better than 'reality'. 
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Heathrow T5.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	We then doubled back from Heathrow T5, and after a little bit of confusion as to whether or not T4 was open (it was not, it was kill), we headed back up the line to 
	Hounslow West, where we had a very important tourist attraction to visit. Hounslow West was a really weird station - to get from the entrance to the platform, you have 
	to walk through an exceptionally long corridor made from corrugated iron, which looks like a huge Anderson shelter. We exited the station, attempted to get run over 
	on the A4 as we crossed back and forth, before reaching our destination: the A30.
	<br><br>
	To the unaware, the A30 is the magic road that runs through Cornwall. Bloody brilliant, and it gets you to your destination dreckly! But every Cornishman knows that 
	the A30, the most amazing dirt-track in Cornwall, goes no further than Exeter... or does it? Well it turns out, that yes it does! In fact, the A30 winds its way all 
	the way to just beyond Heathrow, at some point becoming a modern tarmac road to help reduce the journey time to Camborne from 10 days to 9 (8.75 of those days are 
	after Exeter, so there isn't much anyone can do, shy of introducing Cornwall to 'tarmac', and no-one wants to do that - they'd be burned as a witch!).
	<br><br>
	So we headed to this most famous of points, the A30 in Hounslow, and stood on the junction where the A30 begins, looking back down the road, knowing that somewhere 
	down there, if you go far enough, you'll fall off the edge of the world at 'Zance.
	<br><br>
	This was also an excellent location to film some MathSoc clips, which were punctuated brilliantly by passing planes from Heathrow and confused drivers staring and 
	pointing at James. In fact, we filmed 2 clips, one of which can be seen in some crappy video we did (I think one of the music videos, I forget) and the best one 
	of which can be seen below: ‚áì
</p>
<center><iframe id="largevid" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f0sOG4RYu_k" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>
<p>
	After this we returned to the tube station, descended below ground once again and waited for our Earls Court train, getting a cool Jago shot in the station. 
	We raced the District back along the line (easy win - tick!), then arrived in Earls Court. Here, Matthew had a brilliant plan: in order to make his map-drawing 
	ordeal slightly easier, we would now double back on ourselves and do the exact same journey on the District line, all the way back past Acton Town to Richmond. Oh 
	and he would also take the stairs (all 15 floors of them) because Matthew is smart. We managed to lose each other when we surfaced at the station, because unsurprisingly, 
	going 2 completely different ways through the same station is not a good idea.
	<br><br>
	We boarded the first Richmond train and started jumping on and off, playing our little game at every station. Unfortunately, the District decided it would be an 
	excellent idea to play <i>its</i> little game on <i>us</i>:
	<br><br>
	<strong>"The destination of this train has now changed. This is now a District line train to <i>Ealing Broadway</i>"</strong>
	<br><br>
	Bugger. We left Barons Court, only to find that what had been our Richmond train was now an Ealing Broadway train. Damn. Nevertheless, we continued onwards, 
	to tick off some more stations. Indeed, we continued on all the way to Turnham Green, the final station before the Richmond branch peels off. Duly, we 
	disembarked, along with everyone else on the train, to await the next Richmond train - which was fucking ages away! Hence, Matthew had a fantastic idea - if 
	the next train was so far away, then we could make it to Acton Town in the meantime and tick off more stations before the train arrived! What a capital idea! 
	Hence, he dragged James, kicking and screaming, onto the train, just before the doors closed. James was just about to have a go at Matthew for having yet another 
	stupid idea when;
	<br><br>
	<strong>"The destination of this train has now changed.  This is now a District line train to <i>Richmond</i>"</strong>
	<br><br>
	What the fuck? They changed the destination of the train <i>after</i> the doors had locked? What valley lines nonsense was this? But it was the funniest thing 
	ever to see all the other passengers from the train, who had just disembarked for the Richmond train, press their faces against the glass, jab uselessly at the 
	button to open the doors, and look very sad and forlorn as we pulled off, having the whole train to ourselves. That has to be one of the best NT moments ever.
	<br><br>
	We arrived in Richmond for the first time since Koppa 2, and wandered around the 'vey nice' town centre, looking for some food, because James was starting to 
	get cross. We passed over many options before James decided that what he wanted most was a good old-fashioned Sunday roast: a pub carvery. RIP Matthew's 
	half-hearted attempt at vegetarianism.
	<br><br>
	We walked down to the Thames and walked along the riverside for a few minutes, taking in our surroundings. It barely felt like London - this was definitely more 
	like Surrey than London! We both very much liked it here, needless to say. Moreover, the pub was excellent. We had to wait a little for a table to be free, but 
	when we got inside it was fantastic. We filmed a MathSoc clip here, in and amongst the other pub-goers and James got drunk, ate too much and licked the mint sauce 
	dish clean. Honest to God, you can't trust him anywhere!
	<br><br>
	After our (very large) meal, we waddled back along the Thames and to the station, which unlike on Koppa 2, was not completely kill. Hence, we caught the Slowverground 
	all the way up to Willesden Junction. Here, we pulled off yet another one of Matthew's amazing plans, where in order to go from Southwest London to Southeast London, we 
	went via Northwest London. Fun.
	<br><br>
	The purpose of this trip was to tick off the missing chunk from our Bakerloo adventures. Ironically, this is the section right next to Matthew's new house, so by 
	Koppa 7, less than 2 months later, NT had done this section to fucking death and we were completely and utterly sick of the sight of it. But illi vitae.
	<br><br>
	We changed to the Jubilee at Baker Street and were soon at the nice new section of line after Green Park. Here, Matthew demonstrated something that amazed James - 
	he went on his phone! (And no, this is not a joke about how Matthew refuses to use his phone). A phone? On a train? Underground? What was this black magic? 
	Well I can exclusively reveal that that black magic is in fact <i><s>5G</s></i> 4G, <i><s>paid for by the Chinese government to brainwash you and also sterilise 
	your children</s></i> now installed on the Jubilee Line Extension. <br>
	:)

<p>
	We disembarked at North Greenwich (which looks like an enormous aquarium, I feel I should add), and walked out towards the O2 Arena, and towards the site of 
	our first completely batshit insane 'challenge': The Dangleway vs DLR challenge.
	<br><br>
	At this point I feel I should explain how this challenge came about. Matthew has always looked down on the Dangleway (ironic) and thinks it should be shot. 
	It simply does not belong on the tube map! It is a white elephant! Matthew maintains that it has no practical usage whatsoever as it is awkward, useless and 
	expensive... but it is fast. This was the one positive that the Dangleway had left, and everyone online seemed to agree... but not Matthew! Matthew was determined 
	that even this positive quality could be disproven, thereby finally giving the Dangleway a piece of his mind. Therefore, he proposed a challenge. James would 
	ride the Dangleway across the river, whilst Matthew would take the Jubilee and DLR across the same route. We would start in the car park at the North Greenwich 
	Dangleway terminal, and end... somewhere. We kind of forgot to specify that bit. RIP.
	<br><br>
	Therefore, as we stood outside the North Greenwich terminal, the stage was set. Both of us were raring to go, ready to taste victory over the other. The best way 
	experiencing this extraordinary challenge, worthy of (at the very least) a hefty Daily Mail prize, is to watch the video we filmed: enjoy!

<p>
	Nevertheless, I shall sum up briefly what happens:<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/qEQfNpCoa-M?t=0">0:00</a> - Intro<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/qEQfNpCoa-M?t=29">0:29</a> - We arrive at the North Greenwich Dangleway terminal<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/qEQfNpCoa-M?t=67">1:07</a> - Countdown: 3,2,1, <br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/qEQfNpCoa-M?t=78">1:18</a> - GO!<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/qEQfNpCoa-M?t=83">1:23</a> - Matthew starts sprinting and starts to completely fuck the gryo-stabilised camera<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/qEQfNpCoa-M?t=118">1:58</a> - James boards the Dangleway and is not happy<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/qEQfNpCoa-M?t=136">2:16</a> - James remembers he is scared of heights<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/qEQfNpCoa-M?t=160">2:40</a> - "WOAH! Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, I don't like this!"<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/qEQfNpCoa-M?t=166">2:46</a> - James gives a 'tour' of London, where the City is replaced by some marshland in Dagenham<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/qEQfNpCoa-M?t=184">3:04</a> - Camera quality<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/qEQfNpCoa-M?t=213">3:33</a> - James shitting himself<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/qEQfNpCoa-M?t=229">3:49</a> - Meanwhile Matthew had just made it down to the Jubilee platform, where the train was arriving<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/qEQfNpCoa-M?t=236">3:56</a> - James' last will and testament<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/qEQfNpCoa-M?t=255">4:15</a> - Matthew arrives in Canning Town before <i>legging it</i> up the stairs and through the closing train doors<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/qEQfNpCoa-M?t=305">5:05</a> - James starts descending to the finish line; "I don't know London that well"<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/qEQfNpCoa-M?t=335">5:35</a> - Matthew arrives in Royal Victoria and starts to leg it again<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/qEQfNpCoa-M?t=349">5:49</a> - James spots Matthew's train<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/qEQfNpCoa-M?t=367">6:07</a> - SEAGULL LANE<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/qEQfNpCoa-M?t=376">6:16</a> - The doors open on the Dangleway - now it is a race to the finish!<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/qEQfNpCoa-M?t=389">6:29</a> - James realises we forgot to specify an endpoint<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/qEQfNpCoa-M?t=396">6:36</a> - What kind of fucking font was that sign in?<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/qEQfNpCoa-M?t=399">6:39</a> - James taps out, Matthew keeps running<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/qEQfNpCoa-M?t=422">7:02</a> - And it's a draw!<br>
	<br><br>
	Matthew was dead after all that running. Oh well, time for some more!
	<br><br>
	We filmed a MathSoc clip underneath the Dangleway to replace the one where James was shitting himself, then got on the DLR. At Canning Town the DLR train waiting for us 
	at the platform refused to open its doors, so it headed off in shame to the depot, presumably to be bricked up in some forgotten tunnel. After that minor hiccup, we were 
	off again, heading to the site of our second challenge, one to put even this one to shame: the DLR vs Matthew challenge. On this challenge, there was no vengence to exact 
	upon the transport system - it was just an excuse to get James lost and make Matthew die, live on camera. It was great fun.
	<br><br>
	The starting point for this NT extravaganza was Woolwich McDonalds, a most historic site: the 1st McDonalds in the UK and the 3000th in the world! We in NT 
	are deeply surprised that thousands of people (incl. Scott) do not make pilgrimages here just like Mecca. Then again, those kinds of people can barely make a 
	pilgrimage off the sofa to reach the TV remote, so illi vitae.
	<br><br>
	Once again, I will let the video do the talking, as we filmed basically non-stop for the whole challenge, but I will provide some timestamps to explain what 
	was going on:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=0">0:00</a> - Intro<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=29">0:29</a> - The first McDonalds<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=39">0:39</a> - Explanation of what we will be doing<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=83">1:23</a> - "Vote for me Ewan"<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=107">1:47</a> - Countdown and meta shot<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=142">2:22</a> - GO!<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=145">2:25</a> - "I'm walking through Woolwich town centre"<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=176">2:56</a> - James celebrates his victory<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=199">3:19</a> - James passes some interesting specimens, enters the station, taps in, and heads to the platform<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=249">4:09</a> - "I'm crossing that". Then Matthew passes a cwachead and descends into the tunnel<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=272">4:32</a> - Down the stairs!<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=286">4:46</a> - James' train arrives<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=314">5:14</a> - Matthew enters the bottom section of the tunnel and James boards the train<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=370">6:10</a> - James shows off his extensive DLR knowledge: "This'll be an easy win, I am 99% sure"<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=400">6:40</a> - James pulls out of Woolwich Arsenal<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=420">7:00</a> - Money shot!<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=460">7:40</a> - Matthew approaches the end of the tunnel
	<br><br>
	As a side note, Matthew actually spent about double the time shown in the video in the tunnel - he was down there for about 6 minutes. It was disturbingly 
	cold and humid down there - it felt as if it was January and about to thunder down with rain. It was a cool tunnel though. 10/10 would recommend. Best bit of 
	East London, because it is the only place where you can't see any of East London. Anyway, back to the video:
	<br><br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=480">8:00</a> - Matthew begins to stagger up 15 floors of stairs<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=522">8:42</a> - Matthew staggers towards the light<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=531">8:51</a> - Matthew makes it out of the tunnel whilst James checks his connection<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=563">9:23</a> - Yummy East London<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=617">10:17</a> - James arrives in Canning Town and is convinced that he has missed his connection<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=643">10:43</a> - James exits the train and tries to find platform 3, legging it through the whole station
	<br><br>
	James ran through the entirety of Canning Town, trying to find his platform. And yes, dear reader, James <i>ran</i>. Usually nothing is important enough for 
	James to run, but he ran this time! In fact, he basically turned into Matthew - pushing past people on staircases, pushing over children on escalators, and almost 
	exploding with rage when a slow person stood in front of him on the left hand side. Bastards. Should be gassed.
	<br><br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=703">11:43</a> - Serenity<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=707">11:47</a> - And back to death<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=770">12:50</a> - James' ideal connection turns up about 1 minute late, heading to Beckton<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=790">13:10</a> - And James is off!<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=806">13:26</a> - And back to Matthew, who is now walking over the drawbridge over one of the docks<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=830">13:50</a> - (Barely audible) Matthew can spot the DLR - is that James' train?
	<br><br>
	At this point, let me pay my respects to a clip that the Corbynite forces that control Youtube <i>deleted</i>, yes, that is right, <i>deleted</i> from our 
	video. It was a great clip, the best clip. The Corbyn Yard clip. Whilst it cannot be with us, shared with the world in the video, you, my dear reader, can enjoy 
	it right here:
</p>
<center><video width="40%" controls><source src="../resources/video/CorbynYard.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></center>
<p>
	By this point, James was still absolutely sure he was going to win - he made a 1-2 min connection, caught the first train out of Woolwich, and was now steaming 
	towards Beckton. He was more confident than ever! Matthew on the other hand, was still almost certain that he was going to lose, and would have periodic panic 
	attacks every time he saw a train go past on the viaduct up ahead. Yet there was a tiny part of him that did some quick maths and realised that he might have a 
	sliver of a chance after all... 
	<br><br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=845">14:05</a> - Matthew runs across the long "motorway" bridge (actually the North Circular)<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=899">14:59</a> - Matthew spots James' train yet again, as James sails over the viaduct!<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=922">15:22</a> - Matthew reaches the final leg of his journey and is dead<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=931">15:31</a> - James announces his victory - "I'm sorry Matthew, but I think I've got this"<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=967">16:07</a> - James reaches Cyprus without a Covid test<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=981">16:21</a> - Geoff shot!<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=1020">17:00</a> - Matthew gets confused because it no longer feels like London, then starts running again<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=1095">18:15</a> - James has a moment as he pulls into Beckton<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=1121">18:41</a> - James arrives at Beckton! Victory!<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=1151">19:11</a> - Or was it?<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=1186">19:46</a> - "Screw you James!"
	<br><br>
	And now for what <i>actually</i> happened:

	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=1207">20:07</a> - James arrives at Beckton! Victory?<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=1248">20:48</a> - The meta shot<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=1261">21:01</a> - "HOW? How on earth?"; "WHAT? HOW?"<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=1288">21:28</a> - Matthew proves to James that he didn't cheat (which was not easy)<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=1393">23:13</a> - Conclusion<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=1418">23:38</a> - @geofftech<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=1433">23:53</a> - Wrap-up<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=1474">24:34</a> - "I rang you twice alreadayy"<br>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/FtTBgn9MMZw?t=1481">24:41</a> - "AAA! LOOK AT THAT!"<br>
	<br><br>
	So in the end, Matthew won conclusively, at the minor cost of experiencing multiple cardiac failures and wanting to kill himself every 15 seconds. But this is 
	by no means the end of the DLR, no no! Tune in to a future Koppa adventure for DLR Challenge 2!
	<br><br>
	We headed back to Canning Town, filming excellent shots of the grim and horrible docklands on the way. There is something of a poetic juxtaposition there, no?
	<br><br>
	Here at Canning Town we did another one of Matthew's stupid reversals back and forth to North Greenwich, merely to make his life easier when drawing the map. :)
	<br><br>
	We then took the Jubilee up to Stratford, finally ticking off the eastern half of the Jubilee, then traversed our way through the labyrinthine station (all lines lead 
	to Stratford) to the purp platforms, because we felt like doing some purple trains. We loves the purple train.
	<br><br>
	<strong>"How do I <i>sudoku</i> on that?"</strong>
	<br><br>
	Purple trains are cool, but nowhere near as cool as the shots we took on the train into Liverpool St - those were the shit! Honestly, we seem to be able to parody Geoff 
	nowadays without even trying!
</p>
<center><img src="../resources/photos/Liverpool Street.jpg" width="55%"></center>
<p>
	We headed over towards Pizza Express in NHG for food, because as regular readers will know, the single most important (and time-consuming) part of NT adventures is 
	always getting food. No food? No adventure. This time, however, Matthew was able to use this to his advantage for once, and on the way over there, we ticked off 
	the holes we'd left on the top of the Circle line (*tick*!) and recreated the iconic happenings of Koppa 3 at Moorgate and Barbican, just for you, our viewers. We 
	spoil you, Matthew and James.
	<br><br>
	Before long at all, we were at NHG and headed to Pizza Express. We had been to this one before on Koppa 2, but only as a takeaway, as we had no time left and Matthew 
	was feeling depressed and miserly at the time. This time however, we actually headed inside and sat down for our pizza. It was very nice - one of the best Pizza 
	Expresses we've been to. Possibly the best one in my opinion was the one on Gloucester Road, which we ought to go to again at some point.
	<br><br>
	After pizza and dessert (also very nice) we were feeling extremely full, so waddled over to Hyde Park to try and burn some of it off before we hopped on the trains again. 
	By this point it was almost dark, but we felt we had time for 1 more parody shot before the light was completely gone: the GeoffIPN shot. This was possibly our best 
	ever piss-take shot: we placed the camera on the floor as James walked up to it, but then Matthew would steal the camera mid-shot, like a true IPN (or criminal - depends 
	on whether there were any police around). You can't appreciate it fully unless you watch it, so GO AND WATCH OUR VIDEOS! Like and subscribe!
	<br><br>
	Finally, to round the day off, we ticked off some extra stations. We took the District to Edgware Road, then doubled back on the Circle line, completing our final 
	switchback of the adventure, then took the Circle line all the way to Hammersmith, completing that branch (but yet again failing to take the H&C, which at this rate is 
	never, ever going to happen). We crossed over into Hammersmith Broadway, and took the Piccadilly westwards, back towards home. On the way back, we managed to tick off 
	possibly the hardest station-line combo on the entire tube: Turnham Green! The Piccadilly only stops there for about an hour, very very late in the evenings. Fortunately, 
	NT also only stops very very late in the evening, so here was the hardest tick; Turnham Green: TICK!

<p>
	We took the District from there, ticking off Chiswick Park (this made Matthew very happy), and went back to Premier Inn. We watched a load of clips from the day, 
	especially the ones from the challenges, before realising that it was extremely late at night, and that sleep was a thing that should probably happen. Hence, Matthew 
	left James to it, and walked home to North Acton, being offered some crack along the way when he was near Ealing Broadway. Noice.

<p>
	It was pretty clear to us by the end of Day 2 that our Day 3 plans were kill before they had even started. Were we really going to get up at 3am to catch yet another 
	night bus across London to go and ride the W&C, when it had opened (unannounced) 2 weeks earlier, and thus no-one famous would be there to meet, greet or murder? 
	No, not really. We both preferred sleep over that.
	<br><br>
	And so it was. We slept.
	<br><br>
	At a more sensible time in the morning, we decided to meet up in Acton town centre for plan B: Trotter Towers! Whilst Matthew was slightly late (to be expected) after 
	the bus refused to turn up, we met up exactly where we had split up on Day 1, which is nice and circular. We then walked to the holy grail of all London attractions. 
	Yes dear reader, this was even greater than Beckton sewage works and the A30. This was the one and only Trotter Towers. And it was perfect for filming a MathSoc 
	video! I'll let the video explain everything:
</p>
<center><iframe id="largevid" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ANwXxBoxkoM" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center>
<p>
	<strong>"Does Matthew live near Peckham?"</strong>
	<br><br>
	Very sadly, we had learned a few days before that by 2025, Trotter Towers will be demolished to make way for luxury flats. This is a complete and utter travesty that 
	must be stopped. It is an abomination! So humbly, we ask all our readers to sign the NT petition to stop this heinous crime from being committed! We'll get round 
	to creating that petition dreckly.
	<br><br>
	We walked up back to Acton, talking about old TV shows and where they were filmed (see the above video) before getting back on the bus towards Ealing.
	<br><br>
	Here we almost got murdered. Murdered by an angry, violent and drunk Irishman. I don't know if he was actually Irish. In fact, he probably wasn't. But when I wrote the 
	words "angry, violent and drunk", I realised that the only noun that could come after those adjectives was "Irishman". So there you go. We almost got murdered.

	At this point, the clock was beginning to run down, and yet James still had all his stuff to pack from his room and he still needed food. Unfortunately, Matthew had 
	assigned both of these a total time of "negligible" in his journey planning, so when they inevitably began to take longer than this, he needed to recalculate. Fortunately, 
	the purp trains ensured that getting to PAD on time would still be possible. Easy even. All that we needed to do was to have breakfast in epsilon-time. How hard could 
	that be?
	<br><br>
	<i>More than epsilon-time of breakfasting later:</i>
	<br><br>
	Yeah, you guessed it. It was running time. Matthew took the suitcase and went first, having a 30 second headstart whilst James handed back his keys. The 2 of us 
	jogged all the way from the Premier Inn, across the street by Ealing McDonalds, and around the corner and up to the station. We took a little break to walk for a 
	while, to rest our weary legs, but then suddenly, out of fucking nowhere, Matthew gained a new burst of speed and started to flat-out sprint through the new 
	Lizzie Line station, through the ticket barrier, down 2 flights of stairs, and down to the platform. James overtook Matthew as he sprinted down the stairs, dodged 
	and weaved through the crowd of commuters, and made it to the train just before the doors locked and could not be opened. Matthew meanwhile was just behind, and 
	could hear the set of open doors in front of him beeping to close. He summoned up his inner Londoner and pelted full-speed at the closing doors, executing a flying 
	jump into the carriage, all with a heavy suitcase in tow. No sooner as he was in, the doors slammed shut behind him, and we were off. It was fucking exhausting, and 
	probably the tightest NT connection that we'd ever done.

	We filmed an excellent shot of an 800 beside us, keeping exact pace with it for over a mile, which was awesome. We'd never seen such a cool shot before! We also did 
	some Xi 1 planning - read the successor to this adventure <a href="./xi.html">here!</a>. Finally, we walked, complete with heavy suitcase, all the way to the end of 
	the train, annoying many, many passengers along the way. We made it to carriage 2 by the time we reached PAD, which was good enough - we shot off, out of the train, 
	and onto the concourse, before finding James' platform, where he would get on his Oxford train.

	And with that, Koppa 5 was kill! Thus ended the nuttiest adventure yet!

	On one final note though, you simply cannot understand the feel of this adventure, without listening to its official theme song: ‚ô´ Always look on the shit side of life! ‚ô´<br>
	Learn the 'words' and 'sing' along!
	<br><br>
	Christ that song is a fever dream
