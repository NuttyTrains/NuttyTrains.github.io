<p> With James stuck down in Kernow during chockdown 3, and Matthew having just moved back to London, the picture looked bleak as exams started looming - how were we going 
  to have an NT adventure before the summer? Matthew didn't have the time to come down to Kernow, and James didn't have the time to come to London. So between us, we 
  hatched a plan to meet up somewhere in the middle, something we'd never really had to do before. Cue the Digamma Adventures:

  The next train to arrive at PLATFORM DAI will be the DIGAMMA 1 service to BRIZZLE, calling at TAUNTON, WESTON-SUPER-MARE, ANTI-POLICE VIOLENCE-PROTEST, and CHOCK. 
  PLATFORM DAI for the DIGAMMA 1 service to BRIZZLE.
  <br><br>
  On this edition of Springwatch, we check in on James's friend, Meal Deal the dead pigeon, we spy on various birds minding their own business in a park, TweetyBoi 
  pesters us and malfunctions all day, and we take a close look at Matthew's Seagull Trap (patent pending) that is taking Camborne by storm!
</p>
<p>
  We travelled halfway across the country on the train to meet up for the first time in 7 months, which was very exhiliarating.
  We wandered around Taunton lost, had coffee, wandered around the multi-storey car park and saw a dead pigeon. We walked quickly to the seaside in Weston, then 
  walked quickly back. Then in Bristol we saw "2+2=5" spray-painted everywhere, wandered around the shopping centre, had pizza in the park, laughed at some seagulls, 
  walked to the uni and walked back to the train station, where Matthew opened one of his birthday presents from James. And as ever we spent the train journey jumping 
  on and off and filming shit!
  <br><br>
  Towards the end of the spring term, we decided that we needed another NT adventure in order to retain our sanity, but thanks to Kernow trains not reaching London 
  Wednesdays, James couldn't make it to London, where Matthew was shortly moving back to. Hence, we decided to meet in Somerrrrset and Brizzle, and Matthew came up 
  with one of his amazingly convoluted plans to save 2p on tickets. Soon, Matthew was back in London, and the countdown to NT ϝ1 began!

  <p> Hey, James here, deciding to start writing this one as editing the video wants to make me jump onto the rails and end it all, it may also be that I only had seven hours sleep
  last night. Let's start there, so I was up last night preparing everything that I needed for the trip, the comprehensive list includes; 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Laptop</li>
    <li>Laptop Charger</li>
    <li>Sandwiches and associated food</li>
    <li>Flask, tea bags, milk and cup</li>
    <li>Pens, paper, textbooks, notes and brain</li>
    <li>Earphones</li>
    <li>Myself</li>
    <li>Matthews present(s)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    And last but not least a working twitter bot, this bot was <em>supposed</em> to tweet out when we were at certain stations. It didn't. There are a lot of bugs in the 
    thing and it deserves to go to hell as I was working on it for hours last night. So I went to bed at approximately midnight and woke up at seven and got to the station 
    at 0910 and printed my tickets this was the first strike of the day; the tickets were wrong. So I queued up and waited to get the changed to get the correct ones, so I waited
    and I waited, and I waited, and I waited, ..., and then the attendant turned up and I got them changed, however, it took a good 30 minutes. 30 MINUTES. 30 MINUTES to change some 
    tickets. I was only going to Brizzle! 
  <br><br>
    James got on the train and got quite a bit of work down, including firing up TweetyBoi, who then malfunctioned on the entire journey down, tweeting out completely 
    inaccurate stations for hours on end. Matthew, meanwhile, had arrived at PAD a few minutes before his train was due to arrive (rare), only to find that his train was 
    nowhere to be seen! He had to wait 10 minutes for it to show up - how awful (for a Londoner)! Eventually it showed its sorry face, and Matthew took the 90 minute journey 
    to Brizzle, watching a complex analysis lecture on the way. He changed trains at Brizzle to a Castle Class (which had a socket, to his great surprise), after having a short 
    walk around Brizzle, calling James, and yelling at some random guy drilling a hole in the floor with a jackhammer.
  <br><br>
    VRRRMMMMMM we fast forward to James arriving in Taunton via some chickens in pens made out of portable metal railings. James
    had a wonderful idea, for Matthew, who was on an earlier train, had surely arrived. Hence, James ran across every platform looking for Matthew, and when he couldn't see him, got very very
    confused. Where was Matthew? James then felt a Castle Class arriving, ah, there's Matthew. James was on the opposite platform, so with his 10 tonne bag, so we know the routine... RUN. James 
    jumped down a flight of stairs and plodded up another just as the roaring Castle Class slumps into the station. James waited into the center of the platform as he expected Matthew to appear 
    there, however, Matthew appeared from the front of the train. It was a long time since we have done NT, so we were both looking forward to this! Genbatte NT!
<br><br>
    So it was time to get going around Taunton as Matthew had a tight plan, we had XXX amounts of minutes in Taunton and so we ran off to explore Taunton. So we scanned our tickets (after James losing 
    his tickets). Just after we left the station, we made a friend. Our friend was Meal Deal. This is what Meal Deal looked like, possibly a few days before Digamma 1,
  </p>

  <p>
    and when we meeted Meal Deal, we <strong>could</strong> recreate this absolute gem,

  <p>
    So, we continued into Taunton. Taunton was a long way from the station, but we walked none the less. NT Adventures are seeming to now contain a ludicruous amount of walking, but we wanted a coffee, 
    so we wanted somewhere nice. Taunton ended up being quite nice. We went past a dodgy diner that would most definitely give you something worse than COVID, then over the river and into the center of 
    Taunton. We went and saw the bussling streets of an upmarket and central south west town. We were in James' territory, but it seemed slightly off. It wasn't like his lovely and amazing Kernow. We found 
    a Cafe Nero, after wandering around Taunton about three times. This was a very nice Cafe Nero, it was in an old tudor house. This was when Matthew tightened his gaze on James to see what weird and wonderful
    thing that James was to order. James watched the menu and decided that a Cortado sounded nice, so he donned his more South West accent and asked for a Cortaaaaaaaaaado. The woman behind the desk gave him a 
    look and then went to prepare his drink. Matthew then decided that it was more sensible to just have a Cappuchino. We took our drinks and went off to find somehwere nice to sit. Remember that river from earlier?
    It was time for some nice nutty trains schenanigans.
    <br><br>
    Who says we cant do it twice... why is the ground moving? <br>
    It's just like ffynone, but with coffee <br>
    That sounds like a cheap porno 
    <br><br>
    It ain't over until the fat lady cycles past playing reggae music.
