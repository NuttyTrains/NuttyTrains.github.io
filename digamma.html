<p> With James stuck down in Kernow during chockdown 3, and Matthew having just moved back to London, the picture looked bleak as exams started looming - how were we going 
  to have an NT adventure before the summer? Matthew didn't have the time to come down to Kernow, and James didn't have the time to come to London. So between us, we 
  hatched a plan to meet up somewhere in the middle, something we'd never really had to do before. Cue the Digammma Adventures:

<button type="button" class="collapsible"> œù1: Trains don't stop Camborne Wednesdays! </button>
<div class="content">
<p> The next train to arrive at PLATFORM DAI will be the DIGAMMA 1 service to BRIZZLE, calling at TAUNTON, WESTON-SUPER-MARE, ANTI-POLICE VIOLENCE-PROTEST, and CHOCK. 
  PLATFORM DAI for the DIGAMMA 1 service to BRIZZLE.

  <p> Hey, James here, deciding to start writing this one as editing the video wants to make me jump onto the rails and end it all, it may also be that I only had seven hours sleep
  last night. Let's start there, so I was up last night preparing everything that I needed for the trip, the comprehensive list includes,
  <ul>
    <li>Laptop</li>
    <li>Laptop Charger</li>
    <li>Sandwiches and associated food</li>
    <li>Flask, tea bags, milk and cup</li>
    <li>Pens, paper, textbooks, notes and brain</li>
    <li>Earphones</li>
    <li>Myself</li>
    <li>Matthews present</li>
  </ul>
  and last but not least a working twitter bot, this bot was <em>supposed</em> to tweet out when we were at certain stations. IT didn't. There are a lot of bugs in the thing and it
  deserves to go to hell as I was working on it for hours last night. So I went to bed at approximately midnight and woke up at seven and got to the station at 0910 and printed my tickets
  this was the first strike of the day, they were wrong.
