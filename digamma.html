<p> With James stuck down in Kernow during chockdown 3, and Matthew having just moved back to London, the picture looked bleak as exams started looming - how were we going 
  to have an NT adventure before the summer? Matthew didn't have the time to come down to Kernow, and James didn't have the time to come to London. So between us, we 
  hatched a plan to meet up somewhere in the middle, something we'd never really had to do before. Cue the Digammma Adventures:

  The next train to arrive at PLATFORM DAI will be the DIGAMMA 1 service to BRIZZLE, calling at TAUNTON, WESTON-SUPER-MARE, ANTI-POLICE VIOLENCE-PROTEST, and CHOCK. 
  PLATFORM DAI for the DIGAMMA 1 service to BRIZZLE. On this edition of Springwatch, we check in on James's friend, Meal Deal the dead pigeon, we spy on various birds 
  minding their own business in a park, TweetyBoi pesters us and malfunctions all day, and we take a close look at Matthew's Seagull Trap (patent pending) that is 
  taking Camborne by storm!
</p>
<p>
  We travelled halfway across the country on the train to meet up for the first time ine 7 months, which was very exhiliarating.
  We wandered around Taunton lost, had coffee, wandered around the multi-storey car park and saw a dead pigeon. We walked quickly to the seaside in Weston, then 
  walked quickly back. Then in Bristol we saw "2+2=5" spray-painted everywhere, wandered around the shopping centre, had pizza in the park, laughed at some seagulls, 
  walked to the uni and walked back to the train station, where Matthew opened one of his birthday presents from James. And as ever we spent the train journey jumping 
  on and off and filming shit!<br><br>
  Who says we cant do it twice... why is the ground moving? <br>
  It's just like ffynone, but with coffee <br>
  That sounds like a cheap porno <br>
  It ain't over until the fat lady cycles past playing reggae music.
