	    This was the first of the Nutty Trains adventures, although at the time it was very impromptu. I feel that the following exchange should be quoted: <blockquote> J: Well, what are we going to do today?<br> M: You fancy going on the trains?<br> J: Valleys?<br> *both laughing*<br> M: Yes [eyes glowing with insanity]</blockquote></p>
	    <p>Without giving it any rational thought. we were off! At this point we hadn't decided where we were to go, but we knew we were destined for the valleys, the rules were made as we travelled to Cardiff on an Arriva Coradia. The tension built as we counted down the stations to the real start of NT.  We discovered the Valleys Ranger ticket, which allowed us unlimited travel throughout the valleys that day, which we purchased in Cardiff, to the great amusement of the ticket office staff. <br>
		When we arrived at CDF, we checked the boards for the next train up the Valleys, and it seemed we were destined for Treherbert. Ad Treherbert! We rolled off the platform, in a pacer, and towards the Valleys, this was soon to be a massive culture shock for James, lets go up the Valley's he said, it'd be fun he said, fun it was indeed and very humourous to Matthew.<br>
		We went 'north', as the map led us to believe (we were actually travelling west), up past Cathays, Llandaff, Radyr, which soon became very familiar to us, after numerous escapades into the deepest, darkest fringes of 'civilisation', as we continued our masochism. To avoid the ire of commuters in Cardiff, we decided to switch carriages every time we visited a station. In this way, another NT rule was born, completely impromptu. Whilst still in the Cardiff city boundary, we noticed successive stations becoming quieter and more dilapidated, a sign of things to come.
		The city ended abruptly after Radyr, and we were surrounded by nice contryside, only for it to give way to a massive industrial estate, followed by miles and miles and miles of terraced houses, row after row. We were now penetrating the valleys. On the way up, we jumped off, took pictures and then jumped back on quickly at every station apart from Nantgarw, <s>the best station ever</s>, because the Treherbert train didn't call at Nantgarw. As we ascended further, evening drew in, and the forests clinging to the ever-steeper valley sides became shrouded in mist, then draped in a thick fog. 
	        The colour of the sky had acquired a faint brown tinge by the time we hit Treorchy, but we still weren't at the terminus. We got many puzzled looks on our upward journey - why would anyone put themselves through this torture? Someone asked 'right boys, so what 'ewe doin' then?', the first of many such people, on all our adventures.<br>
		The next stop was to go to Merthyr because we had a lot of time and it was time to try and get killed a second time! <blockquote>This isnt tourism its masochism </blockquote></p>
		<p>We went back to Pontypridd and ran from platform to platform in the rain and over the bridge, laughing at our lack of sanity (a regular occurance for these adventures), we joined a group of locals, with several family groups having seperate domestics, only stopping to stare at us. We alighted a double pacer and went back up north, the stations got slowly more and more desolate and poor. We stood in the wheelchair area while the people down the carriage taking drugs, looked at us in disdain for disturbing their illeagal obsessions.<br>
		At this point, it was dark, raining and everybody on the train was fearing for their lives. We carried on jumping on and off the train and drawing attention to ourselves, especially to by the bloke brandishing a knife and doing Ketamine, but we knew not about this as Benzene was in A2 Organic Chemistry. <br>
		As we pulled up to Merthyr Tydfil, after running down to the sign at Pentre-Bach, we noticed the very close proximity of the Tesco's. So it was time to go for a run, the guard told us: "We depart in 5 minutes boys", we had 5 minutes to explore Merthyr Tydfil Tescos and the attached shopping centre. Even while visiting it we knew this station was the be legendary in relation to NT stations and we still to this day aim to find the stations as legendary as Merthyr Tydfil Tesco, I dont think even Camborne beats it! Remember the station I mentioned in passing earlier? Nantgarw... or was it Treforest Estate, we got to tick that off on the way back, it was a wierd station, just one platform, in the middle of two tracks. I couldnt work out how it worked, but we just took the photo and jumped back on.<br>
		Now, you would think, we ticked off 22 stations, we did well, we can call it a day now. No, of course not, theres plenty more stations to tick off! So we arrived back to Cardiff Central, with our lives in our hands and disembarked with the druggies gang members and valley folk. At this point we were hungry and we decided on a classic Pizza Express, this was a recent discovery for us and soon to become a go-to for food with both of us knowing our orders without having to see the menu. The nuttyness was rekindled in us after some food and it was time to wait for the train, 'wait'...yeah... so we waited for the train and so following from waiting, we went and raced he train down the platform.<br>
		We went and got the 800 back to Swansea and Neath respectively and ticked off the rest of the stations on the Mainline PAD services.

<p> People say, fool me once, shame on me, fool me twice shame on you. We feel the same thing may not be true for the Valleys, as there was no fooling here, we went up by choice! So we started this one slightly later than the other NT adventures, but we still had plenty of time for insanity, don't you worry dear reader!'
1 trip up the valleys evidently wasn't enough to satiate our appetite for masochism, so just a few days after Christmas, we 
	headed back for more.
