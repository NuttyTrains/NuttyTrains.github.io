    <p> Sampi Adventures: Coming soon </p>
	  <h1> &#993;1: Valley Lines 1: (Rhondda/Merthyr Valleys) </h1>
	  <p>
	    This was the first of the Nutty Trains adventures, although at the time it was very impromptu. I feel that the following exchange should be quoted: <blockquote> J: Well, what are we going to do today?<br> M: You fancy going on the trains?<br> J: Valleys?<br> *both laughing*<br> M: Why not?</blockquote></p>
	    <p>So after a quick google and a ticket purchase we were off! At this point we hadn't decided where we were to go, but we knew we were destined for the valleys, the rules were made as we travelled to Cardiff on an Arriva Coradia. The tension built as we counted down the stations to the real start of NT. <br>
		We arrived at CDF and checked the boards for the next train up the Valleys, it seemed we were destined for Treherbert. Ad Treherbert! We rolled off the platform and towards the Valleys, this was soon to be a massive culture shock for James, lets go up the Valley's he said, it'd be fun he said, fun it was indeed and very humourous to Matthew.<br>
		We went 'north', soon to be known as west due to a map, but thats a small detail. Up past Cathays, Llandaff, Radyr, soon to be regular sights for us as we continued our masochism. We jumped off, took pictures and then jumped back on quickly, not to be left in the deepest darkest valley lines. We got many looks as we assended but just as we hit the terminus, soebody asked "'right boys, so what 'ewe doin' then?"
