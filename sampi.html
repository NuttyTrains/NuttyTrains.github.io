  	  <p>
This was the first of the Nutty Trains adventures, although at the time it was very impromptu. Having just finished in college 
for the morning, just a few days before Christmas, Matthew decided to meet James. I feel that the following exchange should be 
quoted: 
	<br><br>
	<b> J: Well, what are we going to do today?<br> 
	M: You fancy going on the trains?<br> 
	J: Valleys?<br> 
	*both laughing*<br> 
	M: Yes [eyes glowing with insanity]</b>
	<br><br>  
<Without giving it any rational thought. we were off! At this point we hadn't decided where we were to go, but we knew we 
were destined for the valleys, the rules were made as we travelled to Cardiff on an Arriva Coradia. The tension built as we 
counted down the stations to the real start of NT.  We discovered the Valleys Ranger ticket, which allowed us unlimited travel 
throughout the valleys that day, which we purchased in Cardiff, to the great amusement of the ticket office staff. 
	<br><br>
When we arrived at CDF, we checked the boards for the next train up the Valleys, and it seemed we were destined for Treherbert. 
Ad Treherbert! We rolled off the platform, in a sprinter, and towards the Valleys, this was soon to be a massive culture shock 
for James, lets go up the Valley's he said, it'd be fun he said, fun it was indeed and very humourous to Matthew.
	<br><br>
We went 'north', as the map led us to believe (we were actually travelling west), up past Cathays, Llandaff, Radyr, which soon 
became very familiar to us, after numerous escapades into the deepest, darkest fringes of 'civilisation', as we continued our 
masochism. To avoid the ire of commuters in Cardiff, we decided to switch carriages every time we visited a station. In this 
way, another NT rule was born, completely impromptu. Whilst still in the Cardiff city boundary, we noticed successive stations 
becoming quieter and more dilapidated, a sign of things to come.
	<br><br>
The city ended abruptly after Radyr, and we were surrounded by nice contryside, only for it to give way to a massive industrial 
estate, followed by miles and miles and miles of terraced houses, row after row. We were now penetrating the valleys. On the way 
up, we jumped off, took pictures and then jumped back on quickly at every station apart from Nantgarw, <s>the best station 
ever</s>, because the Treherbert train didn't call at Nantgarw. As we ascended further, evening drew in, and the forests 
clinging to the ever-steeper valley sides became shrouded in mist, then draped in a thick fog.
	<br><br>
The colour of the sky had acquired a faint brown tinge by the time we hit Treorchy, but we still weren't at the terminus. We got 
many puzzled looks on our upward journey - why would anyone put themselves through this torture? Someone asked 'right boys, so 
what 'ewe doin' then?', the first of many such people, on all our adventures. Treherbert was our first real taste of the valleys. 
We got out of the train, and stood on the single platform, in front of a row a terraced houses overlooking the railway. The 
track continued into a disused tunnel, stretching further up the valley. 
	<br><br>
The valley itself began to climb sharply, with the trees thinning and giving away to gorse and bracken, and a light rain was 
falling, feeling almost like a veil. It really looked like the end of the world. The village was similarly abandoned. Fewer than 
5 passengers got on or off the train, no-one was waiting by the bus stop, and the streets of terraced houses were desolate and 
abandoned. It was startling to think that we were only about 10 miles away from home. It was almost as if we were in another 
world.
	<br><br>
We got back on the train, and sat down to plan our next journey. Dusk was rapidly approaching and the rain was now very heavy, 
but we decided to change at Pontypridd and head to Merthyr Tydfil. We arrived in Pontypridd (surprisingly, a very nice and very 
large station) and ran from platform to platform in the rain and over the bridge, laughing at our lack of sanity (a regular 
occurance for these adventures - James would later remark that an NT adventure was more tiring than a parkrun), then joined a 
group of locals waiting on some dodgy side platform for our first pacer of the day to arrive - it was time to try and get 
killed a second time! 
	  <br><br>
	  <b>This isnt tourism its masochism </b>
	  <br><br>
The locals on the platform were diverse and varied - a real taste of the cosmopolitan nature of the valleys - several family 
groups having seperate domestics, stopping only to stare at us, ket-users, crack-users, spice-users and weed-users, all looking 
at us in disdain for disturbing their illegal obsessions, and the elderly women from up the valley, having finished their annual 
trip to the great city of Pontypridd, watching us outsiders like hawks. We alighted a double (class 800) pacer and went back up 
north, to torture ourselves once more. The stations got slowly more and more desolate and poor as night drew in. We stood in the 
wheelchair area whilst our fellow passengers enjoyed their drugs.
	<br><br>
At this point, it was dark, raining and everybody on the train feared for their lives as the pacer hurled itself down the track, 
at speeds that felt illegal. The windows were shaking, the doors were opening mid-journey, the roof was leaking, half the seats 
were missing, water was streaming down the inside of the windows, and the brakes on the train screamed into life every time the 
train went too far over the speed limit, all in the pitch black of night. 
	<br><br>
We carried on jumping on and off the train and drawing attention to ourselves, especially from the bloke brandishing a knife and 
doing Ketamine. All we knew about ketamine was that it contains Benzene ‚è£ (A2 Organic Chemistry). Fortunately, laughing 
maniacally every time something went wrong with the train, repeating "This is nuts, this is nuts, this is really, truly nuts" 
ad nauseam, and having an insane glint in our eyes kept the other passengers at bay. They weren't the most deranged ones on the 
train that day!
	<br><br>
As we pulled into the wonderful town of Merthyr Tydfil, having just run down to the sign at Pentre-Bach, we noticed that the 
train had terminated in the middle of a Tesco car park. Duly, we renamed the station on our faithful (now historic) map as 
'Merthyr Tydfil Tesco Station'. This was our cue to go for a run. The guard told us: "We depart in 5 minutes boys", so we had 5 
minutes to explore Merthyr Tydfil Tesco. Despite this being only our first adventure, whilst visiting it we knew this station 
was to be legendary in relation to NT stations and we still to this day aim to find the stations as legendary as Merthyr Tydfil 
Tesco. It has even seen off fierce competition from Maesteg Asda Station, Fishguard Harbour and Camborne! We took our photo in 
front of the station sign, which was the first of many.<br>
	</p>
<center><img width="80%" src="./resources/photos/Merthyr Tydfil.jpg"></center><br>
	
<p>Having thoroughly explored the entrance to Tesco, we got back on the train, and settled into the long journey back to Cardiff. 
On the way back down, we ticked off the final missing station, Nantgarw, which TfW insists is actually called 'Treforest Estate'. 
Rubbish. We got to tick that legendary station off on the way back. It is a weird station with just one island platform, in the 
middle of two tracks. James couldn't spot how it worked, so just took the photo and jumped back on, but Matthew, having already 
been there twice before, explained that it had some dodgy tunnel leading out from the centre, under the tracks, and onto a dirt 
track through an industrial zone. Legendary.
	<br><br>
Having arrived in Cardiff, and with 22 stations ticked off, we'd done well, so you'd think called it a day then. No, of course 
not. There are plenty more stations to tick off! We arrived back to Cardiff Queen Street, with our lives in our hands and 
disembarked with the druggies gang members and valley folk. We ran to the side platform for the sprinter shuttle service to 
Cardiff Bay, and travelled down to tick off our final Cardiff/valleys station that day. At this point we were hungry and we 
decided on a classic Pizza Express, which was still a recent discovery for us and soon to become a go-to for food and another 
NT tradition. 
	<br><br>
James made a mistake by ordering the hottest pizza they offered "Because quadrilaterals > circles", then proceeded to eat of 
all the mitigating goats cheese off the pizza, leaving only the spicy bits behind. He had a fun time enjoying the remainder of 
his meal, needless to say. As we headed back to the station, the nuttiness was rekindled in us after some food and it was time 
to 'wait' for the train. Yeah... instead of waiting, we walked to the end of the platform and then raced the train back down the 
platform. (Matthew won).
	<br><br>
We headed back to Cardiff Central, then got a Class 800 back to Swansea and Neath respectively and ticked off the rest of the 
stations on the mainline PAD services. What an amazing end to our first full adventure.
	</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"> &#993;2: Valley Lines 2: (Rhymney Valley) </button>
<div class="content">
<p> People say, fool me once, shame on me, fool me twice shame on you. We feel the same thing may not be true for the Valleys, 
as there was no fooling here, we went up by choice! So we started this one slightly later than the other NT adventures, in the 
middle of the afternoon, but we still had plenty of time for insanity, don't you worry dear reader!
	<br><br>
1 trip up the valleys evidently wasn't enough to satiate our appetite for masochism, so just a few days after Christmas, we 
headed back for more. Armed with another Valleys Ranger ticket, we departed from Cardiff Central yet again, and jumped upon the 
first valley train we saw, this time up the Rhymney Valley! We initially followed the same tracks as on our last journey, but 
then curved eastwards to tackle possibly the dodgiest valley of them all. The Rhymney Valley was the longest of the valleys, 
with numerous stations to tick off. That meant plenty of running at various stations for James. 
	<br><br>
It took us a while to work out where we were as we approached Caerphilly, as the town appeared to have multiple stations (it 
turns out it had 3). From the elevated track, we could see for miles - we could see the castle in the distance... and the town, 
unfortunately. Having gone up the valleys expecting steep gorges and narrow openings in the rock, the plain around Caerphilly 
disorientated Matthew a little, but we quickly progressed to nuttier valley towns, to make sure he was kept insane.
	<br><br>
Fortunately, the track soon became nuttier, until we were held at a halt, awaiting the green signal to move onto the single 
track line. This was Matthew's first journey on a single track railway. We rattled up the line, now surrounded by the familar 
sights of terraced houses, valley sides that blotted out the sun in the late afternoon, disused mine workings, crowds of drug 
addicts having domestics, and the sight of old women glaring out of their windows at this new fangled train travelling way too 
fast through <u>their</u> village. 
	<br><br>
On the way up, we unfortunately missed Gilfach Fargoed, due to the strange service pattern in the Rhymney Valley. We will visit 
Gilfach Fargoed one day, in order to tick it off as our final Valley Line station - the crowning glory on our trusty map. When 
there, we will also recreate the famous VF video when measuring the platform! The train rattled all the way up to 
Rhymney, where we disembarked, to take our photo in front of the sign once more, continuing our tradition. It was 
getting dark already, so after wandering about the station and the vincinity for 10 minutes, we got back on the train 
to Cardiff.<br> 
	</p>
<center><img width="80%" src="./resources/photos/Rhymney.jpg"></center>
	
<p>On the way back, we tucked into a bag of Salt and Vinegar crisps (which we'd been saving since Cardiff). Here was yet another 
NT tradition, forged in the fire of the valleys, on those early December adventures. When we approached Cardiff, James 
expressed a desire to do a Geoff and Vicky, so we disembarked at Heath High Level, and sprinted down the slippery 
staircase, along the main road, before turning down a dodgy alleyway to to Heath Low Level, on the City Line. The 
rickety pacer emerged from the tunnel a few minutes later, and we continued down the track to Cardiff Queen Street. 
Once again, we disembarked here, but this time, decided to wander through Cardiff City Centre. 
	<br><br>
Fortunately, we had been hardened by the sights of the valleys, so no amount of violence or drug abuse could scare us now. We 
walked to St Davids shopping centre, and decided to try Nandos, to see what all the fuss was about, but were thoroughly 
underwhelmed. We reminisced about our school days and about what we'd been up to recently, before getting back on the train and 
heading home. A few days later, James had to head back to Cornwall, meaning this was the last NT adventure that Christmas.

<button type="button" class="collapsible"> &#993;3: Heart of Wales Line </button>
<div class="content">
<p> <b>Jumping on and off trains to request-only platforms, on a line with 4 trains per day? What could go wrong?</b>
	<br><br>
Some people run marathons, in our younger years, these people were seemed as maniacs to us (Although, James is doing a half 
next march at Pembrey... god, it's in March?! I haven't started training yet.). Seeming we undertook this adventure, you dear 
reader must see us as hypocrites, as this was not a marathon it was an Ultra. 4.5hrs of jumping on and off trains, continually 
in the middle of nowhere.	
	<br><br>
This adventure started like every other, Matthew going from Neath to Swansea, James getting on a bus to Swansea (The bus 
genes are still strong) and meeting at Swansea, this time at 9am, in inticipation of the <em>0937 service to Shrewsbury, calling 
at... every little hamlet in the middle of nowhere!</em> This was to be different from the Valley trips as this was planned, in 
relative advance. We were struck instantly with a delay, as we stood on the platform, with another prospective train nutter, he 
gleemed with excitement as he watch the two trains being unable to be parted. At this moment, we remembered back to our 
religious education and thought... "we need moses."
	<br><br>
Luckily, after much pushing, shoving and huffing by the driver, the two seperated and now we were one step closer to the holy 
grail of Nutty Train adventures. Soon we were permitted to board, the one car extraviganza, that was to take us all the way up 
to Shrewsbury. We showed the guard our valley rangers and before we boarded, with timetable in hand, James asked "Now, how many 
request stops can we call at?", the driver looked slightly puzzled, but at the same time had a gleam in his eyes, he replied, 
"Well I am sorry boys, we are on a tight schedule, not many", James quickly replied, "Not even Sugar Loaf?", the guard permitted 
us to stop at Sugar Loaf, for reasons we were to find out later.
	<br><br> 
We were lucky with our guard as he was a jolly fellow and he liked what we were doing, I suppose it gets really really boring 
and samey uppa Heart of Wales. For the first part of our journey, part of the lines we had travelled before, we were joined by 
the locals of Bynea and their associates, we soon were right at home with the counterfit valley people. Ketamine, Stabbings, 
Domestics, none of that stuff fazed us now! We were joined by some employees of TfW, who took particular interest in our 
platform escapades. So did the guard, I think this may be the best place to add the fact that the <s>Arriva</s> TfW guards are 
extremely lovely and understanding of our cause.
	<br><br>
So we got to the new track and we grabbed our bags and got ready to start jumping on and off, 4.5hrs, this was going to be tough 
one. So our first 'new' station was Llangenech, we jumped off, not expecting to stop and jumped back on, one down... probably 
about 30 more to go. So we then did the next stop... and the next... and the next. The next notable stations were the Swansea 
X / 16 termini, so firstly it was Pontardulluis, then Ammandford, which was a little quaint gravelled station with many leaves on the ground. 
James approved of this station very very much. 
	<br><br>
So we continued more north, past the places we had heard and then onto new names. We soon had an unexpected visit from the guard, we thought "oh god,
we are to be chucked off in the middle of nowhere!", but alas, we were to ride for some more stations.

<button type="button" class="collapsible"> &#993;4: Valley Lines 3: (Maesteg/Barry/Aberdare) </button>
<div class="content">
	<p>
<b> Having visited seemingly every supermarket rail terminus in South Wales, and standing in the middle of a road, 
screaming, "Run me over, 'en!", it was time for Matthew and James to admit they had a problem.</b>
	<br><br>
In Summer 2019, we decided it was high time to make one final trip up the valleys to tick off dozens of Valley line stations. 
We set off early in the morning for once, and headed out towards Bridgend. When we arrived, we bought our Valley Ranger tickets 
and set off up to Maesteg. The Maesteg valley was a classic valley line, complete with steep sides, terraced houses, and even a 
supermarket terminus. We pulled up into Asda car park, and dutifully renamed the station "Maesteg Asda Station", which was 
fitting, seeing as Maesteg has 2 stations, and they needed to be differentiated. The only thing that could have improved this 
first leg was if we'd had a pacer.<br>
	</p>
<center><img width="80%" src="./resources/photos/Maesteg.jpeg"></center>
	
<p>We then headed back down the short valley to Bridgend, and continued on the line through the Vale of Glamorgan. For once, 
we were on a serene, quiet valley line, with no dilapidation in sight! We were able to sit back in the long gaps between 
stations and enjoy the view. This soon changed when we arrived in Barry. We alighted at the large station, admired the amazing 
GWR benches painted in Arriva Blue, and waited for our service to Barry Island. Fortunately, the levels of desolation and 
desperation that had characterised Valley Line trips so far were about to return, and return with a vengence. 
	<br><br>
The train arrived, and as we got on, we were surrounded by genuine holidaymakers, to our absolute surprise and bewilderment. We 
questioned how anyone could possibly want to holiday in Barry Island. As we drew nearer, James was shocked by the acres of empty 
car parks and the abandoned theme park. His mum had warned him not to come here. Nevertheless, we pulled up in the station, now 
in the pouring rain and gale force wind, and were abandoned in Barry Island - desolation unlike anything we'd ever seen before. 
We went past the abandoned theme park, and reached the embankment. The wind was nearly hurricane strength now, and we had to 
lean into the wind, with our hoods scrunched over our faces, just to be able to stand. Some elderly women were less lucky. 
	<br><br>
Despite the terrible conditions, people were still selling ice cream, to our great amusement. We approached the line of shops, 
and noticed that every other shop was either an arcade or a casino. We entered the largest arcade for shelter, and witnessed 
possibly the saddest image to sum up NT&#993;: half the rides in the arcade were broken, and the other half were not functioning. 
The floor was covered with mouldy, decomposing carpet tiles in places, bin bags in others, corrugated iron in one area, and the 
last section had no floor at all - it was literally built on dirt. The floor was uneven and bumpy, with a massive hill in the 
middle! What madness was this? The roof was leaking water in numerous places, sometimes into buckets, sometimes onto old rides, 
and sometimes onto the exposed electrical cabling. The doors towards the back were sheet metal, which had been broken through 
with blow torches, and the windows all around had been smashed by bricks. This was a sight unlike any other, no matter which 
valley we went to. Feeling thoroughly shocked that our masochism had reached new depths, we fled, out into the rain again. 
	<br><br>
We headed back to the station, passing a statue of a roman soldier... in Barry Island... in a theme park. What was going on? 
Finally, we reached the station, only to be 2 minutes late, trapping us there for 13 more minutes. We bided our time in the 
station cafe before escaping at last.
	<br><br>
We headed north, away from the horror show of Barry Island and the elderly valley women on their annual exotic holiday, towards 
Cardiff. Weirdly, James met his maths teacher from Cornwall on this journey. Before reaching Cardiff, we alighted at Grangetown 
IKEA station, and walked to IKEA for lunch, which was very enjoyable. As we sat in IKEA, we took a break, and planned the rest 
of our journey. Follwing some minor food shopping, we set off... away from Cardiff, back south to Penarth. Passing the 
amazingly-named Dingle road, the poor train climbed relentlessly, clinging to the side of the mountain, squeezed behind rows of 
houses. We reached Penarth, ticked off another spur, and headed to Cardiff at last.
	<br><br> 
Here, we spotted the All The Stations Flag flying above the station, bought the obligatory packets of salt and vinegar crisps, 
and ticked off Cardiff Central, because we may or many not have messed up and forgotten to tick it off in the past. After that, 
we headed north once more, to our final central Valley line, Aberdare!
	<br><br>
We had heard many stories about Aberdare from one of our friends in school, so we were expecting the worst. On the way up, we 
followed the track of the Merthyr line, reminding us of &#993;1. We then diverged at Penrhiwceiber, and James had great fun 
mangling the Welsh pronounciations. Finally, we arrived at our terminus, which disappointingly, was not in a supermarket car 
park. Fearing that NT was losing its nuttiness, we walked down to the main road, stood in the middle, and screamed, "Run me 
over, 'en!" to the cars, who took this as a challenge. It was now time for Matthew and James to admit they had a problem. 
Finally, we took our terminus sign photo, and what an amazing photo it is:
	<br></p>
<center><img width="80%" src="./resources/photos/Aberdare.jpeg"></center>
	
<p>Eating our crisps on the way down, we then planned our final leg of the journey, to try and crack the Cardiff City line, an 
incomplete ring around the city which Matthew had had some bad experiences with in the past. It was decided that we would 
disembark at Queen Street, head anticlockwise to the terminus (inadvertently recreating Matthew's failed previous attempt at the 
line), before going clockwise all the way around to Radyr, our final station. Our journey on the way back down was... interesting. 
For the first time in NT, we had encountered some trainspotters. James spent most of the journey gently arguing with him/her 
(we disagreed here), and defending his knowledge of trains, his memory, and our previous adventures. He also unsuccessfully 
tried to promote the Real-Time Trains app that he uses. After arguing gently for an hour, we disembarked from the most awkward 
train trip in history, and vowed to never again interact with trainspotters -  that conversation had been a complete derailment.
	<br><br>
We came to the conclusion that just like Geoff and Vicki, we are interested in the railways, the stations, the networks and the 
places, not just the trains (although, when TfW goes around nabbing everyone else's trains, you have to pay attention to the 
trains too!).
	<br><br>
The city line went smoothly, as we ticked off the stations, and Matthew relived his PTSD. Finally, we arrived in Radyr, took a 
photo, and explored the station. We then had a dilemna. 2 trains were scheduled to arrive at Radyr simultaneously. Which would 
we choose? We sprinted back and forth between platforms in anticipation, almost killing James in the process. Then, a sprinter 
turned up... on the wrong platform. But a rival appeared - a pacer on our platform. We eagerly awaited it, and jumped aboard! Both 
trains started up, their pitiful bus engines on at maximum power, and their ill-fitting wheels screaming into life. Both began 
to accelerate towards the station exit, but which would win? Would they collide? ...unfortunately not -  I am still alive. 
Luckily, our pacer out-paced our rival sprinter, and we headed back to Cardiff, to await our train home. 
	<br><br>
Whilst there, we laughed ourselves silly at our concept of pacer races, but laughed even harder when we witnessed the awful mess 
TfW had made of repainting their fleet - they had different colour carriages coupled to one another, they had trains that they 
hadn't been bothered to paint, so stuck a sticker on instead, and they even had Matthew's favourite train, the one they 
accidentially painted a completely wrong colour - silver instead of white! (We know that this was a TfW cock-up, because there are 
no trains in Britain which are deliberately painted silver and red). Finally, a class 43 HST turned up! What you do'in? Matthew 
was gobsmacked that this supreme convocation of trains had all turned up at once. Sufficiently amused, Matthew and James headed 
home after their longest ever NT journey.

	<p> 
<b> Uh, James, I think there's been a mistake: I don't remember this one </b>
	<br><br>
Okay. Let's have a think about what is going on. I'm Matthew... or am I James? I'm not sure about that bit. This appears to be a 
website. Oh look - it is our website! We seem to go on "nutty train adventures" together... we must be really, really weird!
	<br><br>
It looks like we normally go to Cardiff, before heading up the valleys. Ohhhh - the valleys. Unfortunately, that has bit has come 
back to me. One can't forget the valleys. In fact, this is starting to come back to me now. I think we had 1 valley left, so I guess 
we went up this last valley to tick it off... Hmm, that seems plausible. What was it called again? Oh. Oh God. The last valley was 
Ebbw Vale. I wish I'd forgotten this one.
	<br><br>
Let's try and start from the beginning, so I can piece together what we did. James caught the train from Swansea, and Matthew joined 
at Neath. I'm pretty sure Matthew brought someone along with him. Oh right, he brought his girlfriend Freya along. Wow. Matthew has 
a girlfriend? Moreover, there is a 50% chance I am Matthew.... wow. Wonders will never cease.

I don't remember buying a valley ranger ticket this time. In fact, I think we'd actually planned this one out - what a complete shock! 
That normally doesn't happen! It looks like we bought a ticket to Cardiff, and then from Ebbw Vale to... somewhere. That other 
place escapes my mind. Either way, we got to Cardiff, and then had to leave the station, to change to Platform 0. Platform 0? My 
memory must be really badly affected. Platform 0 sounds really weird and nutty - but I guess I should be expecting that. Hmm.
	<br><br>
We caught a train quite early in the morning, I believe, and then we did our thing of jumping on and off the train at every station, 
running to the station sign, taking a photo, and running back on. I hope I'm not James, because James is the one who has to do all 
the running - Matthew just stands with one foot on the platform, one foot on the train. Lucky! Not only does he get to not run, he 
has a chance of being dying. I really hope I'm Matthew.
	<br><br>
Like all the other valleys, the Ebbw Valley has this strange, semi-postapocalyptic feel to it. Abandoned, decaying industry littered 
the valley floor, whilst seemingly desolate streets of terraced houses hugged the steep walls of the valley. Yet the Ebbw Valley 
also seemed more picturesque than the others. Lushious forests filled all remaining space in the valley, as well as magnificent 
cliffs. It probably helped that the weather that day was amazing, unlike the pouring rain of our previous NT adventures. On the way 
up, we stopped at œÄ ‚àü, Risca & Pontymister (possibly the station name we find funniest so far), and <s> Conti Fish Bar Station </s> 
Newbridge Station. As tempted as we were to sample the culinary delights of the Ebbw Valley, we had to move on.
	<br><br>
We finally arrived at the terminus...and we underwhelmed? Where was the desolation, the dilapadation, the obligatory supermarket 
terminus or the general aura of shittiness? Ebbw Vale was such a disappointment. Instead, it terminated at a <i>library</i>! Ebbw 
Vale had promised us the crowning glory of the valleys, but had failed to deliver. Disgusting.
	<br></p>
<center><img width="80%" src="./resources/photos/Ebbw Vale.jpeg"></center>
	<p>
On the way back down, I remember trying to plan the remainder of our journey. Matthew's clever ticketing solution was to start 
our journey from Ebbw Vale to elsewhere in the middle, doing 1/2 of the return, then the outward journey, followed by the other 1/2 
of the return. This is technically illegal, but it was going to be fine, because TfW services never had conductors who marked your 
ticket, right? ... The conductor marked our ticket. We were screwed.
	<br><br>
Another failing of Matthew's illegal ticketing solution was that we couldn't get out of the barriers at Cardiff without staff assistance. 
Eventually, we got out and walked to Tesco for some lunch. Here, we purchased the obligatory salt and vinegar crisps, as well as 
a new NT tradition: coconut macaroons. We got back to the station, were allowed back in, and got on the train again.
	<br><br>
Feeling he ought to defend his illegal ticketing solution, Matthew explained that it relied upon the Ebbw Vale effect - a secret 
effect that wasn't even picked up by online ticketing apps - eastbound tickets from Ebbw Vale are cheaper than eastbound tickets 
from Cardiff, despite passengers from Ebbw Vale having to travel through Cardiff first. We named it the "Ebbw Vale Effect" and 
explained it as follows:
	<br><br>
<b>Ebbw Vale Effect [noun]: Ebbw Vale is so shit, they pay people to leave</b>
	<br><br>
We ate our lunch as we travelled down the line towards Chepstow, passing the Nazi town hall in Newport, and one of our favourite 
stations, Severn Tunnel Junction. The track then curved up to follow the River Severn, as we headed out of Wales once more. Along 
the banks of the severn, our sprinter passed fields of cattle and 2 Magnox nuclear power stations. Yum. Radiation. We were headed 
towards Gloucester (which had some very nice mosaics in the station), but I distinctly remember not staying there - we definitely 
went one stop up the line. But where could that be?
	<br><br>
<b>Oh. My. Word.<br>
Now I remember everything.<br>
This wasn't a normal place we visited. Not some crappy valley town or picturesque rural hamlet. No.<br>
We went to "Cheltenham".</b>
	<br><br>
I feel as if I should begin our account of "Cheltenham" by dispelling a common misconception about the town: namely, that "Cheltenham" 
is a real place.
	<br></p>
<center><p><b>"Cheltenham" is not a real place.</b></p></center>
	
<p>In fact, "Cheltenham" is completely fake. The houses, the streets, the shops, the people - everything. Everything is entirely fake.<br>
You see, "Cheltenham" was built around the new HQ of your friend and mine, GCHQ, in 2003. When they built their new HQ, they had 
to try and make it blend in, so they decided to construct an entire fake town around it, to try and help cover it up. In hindsight, 
the Magnox nuclear power stations on the way in made complete sense. The radiation dosage you recieve through the plastic windows 
of the sprinter over the miles of track by the riverside is so high, that it drugs you into believing that "Cheltenham" is actually 
real. Fortunately, all 3 of us had played some of Professor Layton before - we knew how Folsense worked, so we weren't going to be 
fooled here!
	<br><br>
When we arrived in the station, it was immediately obvious that the town was fake. It was a really poor simulation. The TfW train, 
which was meant to head back down the tracks to Wales, instead carried straight on for a few hundred yards, came to a halt, so the 
driver could get out and have a fag. What was going on? We then left the station, and proceeded to walk towards the epicentre of 
the simulation - the GCHQ HQ. We passed through a completely fake estate, with generic streets of generic houses named after poets. 
They didn't even try to make it seem real.
	<br><br>
We passed some shops, at which point some vehicles started to follow us. Shit. They knew we were outsiders. They recognised us from 
our internet traffic. They knew who we were, where we were going, and what we were thinking. We started to run down the street, but 
they kept up their pursuit. When we ran across the road in front of them, they tried to run us over - they couldn't allow outsiders 
to get that close to the HQ! Fortunately, when we rounded the corner, they backed off. We then walked through a fake council estate 
of blocks of flats, but secretly, they were just filled with communication and surveillance equipment. They didn't even try to hide 
it - you could see the "TV aerials" in each apartment. Not only that, but the blocks of flats had triangular rooves like houses 
- that is just sloppy simulation.
	<br><br>
We reached the main road, then walked up to the HQ itself. We didn't dare walk right up to the barbed-wire fence - we didn't want to 
tempt their snipers any further! We realised that they probably recognised us - we'd probably been there 7 times before, and they'd 
sorted us out after each adventure - yet here we were again!
	<br><br>
We then walked along the main road to the town centre, which was a much longer walk than we anticipated, but it allowed us to take 
in all the fake sights along the way. We saw the GCHQ primary schools, where they train little children to hack other intelligence 
agencies, we saw the rows of houses, complete with elderly women, the most low-tech mass surveillance weapon in existence, and the 
<i>armada</i> of buses with <b>GCHQ</b> emblazoned on them. Matthew and James were absolutely rolling with laughter at how poorly 
kept the secret is within "Cheltenham". We even saw the fake postboxes with people inside, so Matthew waved to the postbox and James 
started talking to it through the letter slot. What a poor simulation. Along the way, we also laughed about Room 5. It was everywhere...
	<br><br>
Everywhere...
	<br><br>
We reached the town centre, and marvelled at the streets of fake shops, including a fake motorcycle garage, and a fake inn. We 
headed up to the main street, where we admired the fake buildings and fountains, then crossed the street (dodging the GCHQ buses) 
and went into the T2 shop. All 3 of us love tea, so this was a huge mistake. We each ended up buying a box of loose leaf tea, which, 
admittedly, was the non-fake thing we had in Cheltenham. That and the ice cream in the fake park. T2 had some interesting teas, 
including some sickly sweet ones and some very smoky ones. Matthew went for Morning Sunshine (Darjeeling+Assam+Rwandan), Freya tried 
Oolong, and James had (insert tea here).
	<br><br>
Unfortunately, despite running for a reasonable distance, we missed our scheduled train out of "Cheltenham", meaning that 
we decided to catch the later CrossCountry service (all the way from the North to Penzance). We got to the station, picked up some 
timetables, and returned to reality at last.
	<br></p>
<center><img width="80%" src="./resources/photos/Cheltenham Spa.jpeg"></center>
	<p>
As it might be expected, the long-haul service both smelt bad as was crowded, so the three of us sat by the doors. When the conductor 
arrived, he was too tired to care about our illegal ticketing solution, so he stamped our tickets and moved on. We were on the 
for about 20 minutes, before we arrived at Bristol Parkway, our last station for the day. Matthew and Freya took a special photo 
there, seeing as the Bristol open day almost an entire year earlier had meant a lot to them.
	<br><br>
Eventually, we caught the GWR train back to Cardiff, whereupon Matthew and Freya were coerced into eating an entire bag of salt 
and pepper crisps by James on the packed one-carriage wonder (at rush-hour) home. Matthew and Freya left at Baglan, and James continued 
onto Swansea. Less than 2 weeks later, Matthew and James would head out once more for another NT&#993; adventure. We will not, 
however, be making another trip to "Cheltenham" - we have already been 7 times... or was it 8? I can't remember.

<div class="content">
	<p>
<b>It was time to leave behind the comforting smells of ketamine and crack cocaine in the valleys, and venture to distant termini,
in a galaxy far, far away.</b>
Disclaimer: I promise this time that really did happen. I have not had my mind erased this time! James and Matthew now had the 
terrible dilemma of having exhausted all the stops (bar Gilfach Fargoed) in the valleys. It was time to start venturing further 
afield. We had planned &#993;5 on a whim in James's kitchen a few days before, but we planned &#993;6 extensively. It had taken 
Geoff and Vicky most of the day to do it using an impure solution (albeit, travelling from Cardiff), so we were going to have issues. 
Fortunately, Matthew was able to divise a Heath Robinson way of doing it, using his trusty timetables, blackboard and coloured chalk.
	</p>
<center><img width="80%" src="./resources/photos/NT VI Plan.jpg"></center>
	<p>
We set off from Swansea at 10am, and headed west, ticking off the intermediate stations beyond Llanelli. Here, we were lucky with 
request stops, a theme which fortunately continued all day. We hit Carmarthen, then Whitland, before barrelling down the same route 
we took over a year before during Œ≤2, towards Tenby. Amazingly, we hit all the request stops bar Saundersfoot on the way down, despite 
having resigned ourselves to the fact that we probably weren't going to be very successful with request stops that day.
	<br><br>
We arrived at Tenby, and the train stopped for a few minutes. It turned out that the guard on the train that day recognised us 
from a previous adventure, so knew exactly what we were doing already (he was very helpful in letting us know about request stops). 
We had a wander around the station, just like we'd done before, then boarded the train to venture deeper into Pembrokeshire. We 
passed beautiful campsites, took in amazing sea views, and saw picturesque castles along the way. The stations towards the end of 
the line also became quite quaint, with twee station buildings, single platforms, and beautiful flower beds. We also started to 
draw the attention of our fellow passengers, who were intrigued as to what we were doing. Fortunately, James had business cards 
with this website's <a href="www.jsites.co.uk" target="blank">original URL</a> printed on them to explain! We started talking to 
2 elderly women, who recommended we visit a particular cafe in Pembroke Dock (our first terminus), and were very enthused by what 
we were doing. We later ran into them in Asda in Pembroke Dock.
	</p>	
<center><img width="80%" src="./resources/photos/Pembroke Dock.jpg"></center>
	<p>
Pembroke Dock was a nice station, but the town was more questionable. Using Matthew's talent for finding the nearest supermarket/
70s shopping centre\70s car park, we headed to Asda for some lunch. Walking down the street of shops on our way out (eating our 
lunch), we passed a shop entitled <b><q>Pembroke Dock: Birthplace of the Millenium Falcon</q></b>. I told you I wasn't lying!
	<br><br>
As always, we then managed to find ourselves in the scummier end of Pembroke Dock, before approaching the docks themselves. We 
marvelled at the scale of the old docks, and also the enormous, comically large bridge across the estuary. It was here, standing by 
the waterfront, that we decided to create this website. We then walked around the town some more, coming far too close to various 
old miltary complexes, before heading back into the town centre to look for tea (unsuccessfully). Finally, we headed down to the 
station, and set off, back to Carmarthen, ticking off our final stop on the branch line (Saundersfoot) on the way.
	<br><br>
We arrived in Carmarthen at half past 2, and had almost exactly an hour to kill. Luckily, we had arrived in the land of Mrs Jones, 
which James knew surprisingly well. We walked across the footbridge, tried to get killed crossing the A40 (which, incidentally, 
was the road we tried to get ourselves killed on whilst crossing it in "Cheltenham"), before heading into the town centre. The town 
centre flabberghasted Matthew. He could not fathom how such a backwater like Carmarthen could afford such a massive redevelopment 
scheme, and continue to house more large shops than Swansea. Despite James's best efforts to rationalise it, Matthew remained baffled.
	<br><br>
We left the main shopping parade, and turned down a side street to a little cafe called Pethau Da. It had a sun for a logo, which 
looked very inviting, so we headed in. We sat down on a table underneath the staircase, and ordered some tea each. If I remember 
correctly, Matthew ordered peppermint tea, and James had the rather unusual apple and mint. James's was especially tasty. 
		<br><br>
Unfortunately, time started to tick down, and eventually we only had 12 minutes to get to the station. If we missed the train, then 
our schedule for the rest of the day would be thrown. So Matthew downed his boiling tea, James got a takeaway cup for his, and we 
walked out of the door. Then ran. We sprinted down the shopping parade, turned sharply down the staircase, passed a bus station/entrance 
to a car park, sprinted across the A40, and made it to the footbridge with 3 minutes to spare. Now in pieces, we walked leisurely 
across the bridge, before catching the train, and sinking into our seats to recover.
		<br><br>
We had half an hour's journey to our next stop, Clunderwen, but we feared that our luck might start to run out as we ventured 
into the request stops once again. And yet, by some miracle, we managed to stop at every stop on the line on the way down. However, 
we became too comfortable on the train, and were not prepared for Clunderwen. Disaster struck! We arrived late at the carriage doors, 
James's phone was off, and Matthew wasn't ready to jump off to take the photo himself, so we missed the station! Disaster! What were 
we going to do? Disheartened, we stayed by the doors, but luckily managed to tick off Clarbeston Road and Haverfordwest (we missed 
Johnston upon seeing how busy the station was), before arriving at Milford Haven, where we took our obligatory photo in front of 
the station sign.
		<br><br>
Milford Haven station was just a single platform with a shelter, and was more like a valley station than a former HST terminus. 
It didn't even have the longitudinal signs we were used to (hence our photo is of the BR totem pole instead). We left the station, 
walked up the steep path to the roundabout, cut along a few grass banks, before climbing the road up towards the town centre, 
passing the marina to our right.
	</p>
<center><img width="80%" src="./resources/photos/Milford Haven.jpg"></center>
	<p>
Admittedly, we weren't quite prepared for what we saw. The town was perched on a steep cliff, with the road sharply climbing 
around the perimeter, meaning we were unable to see the seaside town we had been expecting. Instead, we were greeted by the biggest 
industrial complex west of Port Talbot! The lovely marina with its sleek yachts gave way to the gritty industrial port with 
gargantuan oil tankers, and as we rounded the hill, we had a better view of the opposing bank of the inlet, where 2 huge oil tankers 
were berthed, next to a large and complex network of pipes, looking like something out of a science-fiction film. The web of pipes 
and tubes fed into a series of vast concrete domes and silos embedded into the hill in an irregular, almost fungoid-like manner, 
behind which a forest of concrete chimneys and steel flue pipes erupted from the crest of the hill. Looking to the east, we saw 
5 towering chimneys looming over a large concrete building, which we naturally assumed to be a nuclear power station. As you can 
imagine, this super-industrialisation was not what Matthew and James were expecting to find in deepest, darkest Pembrokeshire, 
especially as they had spent the morning <i>on the opposite bank</i>, next to the nuclear power station and the oil refinery!
		<br><br>
Some of James's friends in Cornwall messaged him to ask for the lovely pictures of beautiful, rural Pembrokeshire he had promised 
them. Hmm, that was going to be a problem. It later transpired that the oil refinery we were looking at was actually just one of 
4 surrounding the town in a ring of pollution. Wow, so rural.
		<br><br>
We had more pressing concerns at this point though. We had a town to explore and food to find. The town centre, as expected, was 
pretty much abandoned. The whole shopping street was filled mainly with derelict shops, so we kept climbing to the crest of the 
hill. At the very top, we reached a 3/5 food hygiene rating fish and chip shop. Assessing our risk of death to be only moderate, 
we headed in to order chips for James. The shop wasn't as bad as we feared, but Matthew did watch a spider plunge into the vat 
of chips, luckily after James had been served!
		<br><br>
With 15 minutes until the train, we ate our chips as we leisurely walked down the hill towards the station, for once, without sprinting! 
We caught our train, finished the chips, and ticked off Johnson on the way back. Once again, we hit every request stop, which 
gave us hope that we'd have a chance to tick off Clunderwen. Even though we suggested measures as extreme as altering the NT rules 
to tick it off, Matthew was determined to remedy his mistake, and tick it off the old-fashioned way. As predicted, we pulled up 
at the station, except this time Matthew ran onto the platform, armed with his phone to get a picture, whilst James stood guard. 
For once in his life, his phone actually took a decent picture (on the 3rd attempt), and Matthew dashed back on, having officially 
completed his NT initiation! Clunderwen was our final request stop of the day, and we were delighted to have ticked them all off, 
despite thinking it would be an impossible task!
		<br><br>
Our guard on the first train had warned us about Whitland: don't get off, there is nothing there! Unfortunately, the timetables meant 
that in order to catch our final train, we had to alight here instead of Carmarthen. So duly, we alighted, and were abandoned in 
some desolate village in rural West Wales, on a Thursday evening as dusk drew in. The guard hadn't lied. The village was empty.
Almost uniquely in our adventures, we managed to explore almost the entire town in our short stay there (admittedly, we didn't get 
to the 2 neighbouring villages). We found the most interesting things to be the town hall, the co-op, and the public toilets, 
which appeared to be in someone's back garden. Odd.
		<br><br>
With 15 minutes to go, we waited on the platform in the shelter (coming into contact with another train nutter, unfortunately), 
and we discussed the looming prospect of university, less than 2 weeks away for James, and less than 4 weeks for Matthew. Even then, 
sitting there on the desolate platform in the atmospherically fading light, we could scarcely comprehend the magnitude of the 
seminal change we were facing.
		<br><br>
We boarded the train, and set off on our final branch, to Fishguard. The Fishguard branch has only 2 stations; Fishguard and Goodwick, 
and Fishguard Harbour. The former was as we expected - a similiarly twee village station to the ones on the Pembroke branch. The latter 
was possibly the strangest station we had ever encountered.
		<br><br>
The train wound its way along the sheer cliff-face, as it plunged ever further into the deepest workings of the harbour. Despite 
having visited 2 maritime termini already that day, we had never been afforded access into the docks like this before. We passed 
towering cranes and high fences, stacked containers and fishing trawlers. Yet again, everything seemed incredibly desolate. 
		<br><br>
By the time we pulled up at the single platform and alighted, the sky had acquired a grey tinge, befitting the dark and gloomy ferry 
terminal at which we had arrived. We headed inside to see an empty departure board, a shuttered-up ticket office, and scores of empty 
seats, all awaiting a ferry that would seemingly never come. The steel columns and beams in the station were slowly rusting, and the 
windows overlooking the opposite cliffs were grimy and stained. This was an immensely atmospheric and strange station. 
		<br><br>
We headed outside to admire the cliffs, before James tried to find a way over the high fences towards the sea - his inner Cornishman 
was calling him! One by one, our fellow passengers got into their cars and drove off, leaving just us and the train nutter behind 
(James fortunately shouted this fact out, reasonably loud, in those exact terms, right as he was behind us). We took our station 
photo, burst out laughing at what James had just done, and headed back home.
	</p>
<center><img width="80%" src="./resources/photos/Fishguard Harbour.jpg"></center>
	<p>
Night quickly set in as the train headed down the tracks, through all the stations we had visited, back to Swansea. Along the way, 
we continued to discuss the future. Even more so than after GCSEs, this truly felt like the end of an era. Everything was going 
to change. James was going to be living on his own in Cornwall, whilst Matthew would be moving to London on his own a few weeks 
later. There was no going back.
		<br><br>
Fortunately, the discussion took some lighter turns. We discussed the formation of this new website, and laughed about all the 
adventures we could have in future, including whether we could invite any other friends along. The train eventually pulled into 
Swansea at 9pm, in the pitch black, where James alighted to catch his bus, and Matthew caught the train home. And so ended NT &#993;6.
