  <p>This is the main part of our adventures, from the valleys to the highlands, so a new format is needed, click on a tab and read the account of the particular adventure, written by either Matthew or James, I am sure you can work out who wrote it!</p>

	    This was the first of the Nutty Trains adventures, although at the time it was very impromptu. I feel that the following exchange should be quoted: <blockquote> J: Well, what are we going to do today?<br> M: You fancy going on the trains?<br> J: Valleys?<br> *both laughing*<br> M: Why not?</blockquote></p>
	    <p>So after a quick google and a ticket purchase we were off! At this point we hadn't decided where we were to go, but we knew we were destined for the valleys, the rules were made as we travelled to Cardiff on an Arriva Coradia. The tension built as we counted down the stations to the real start of NT. <br>
		We arrived at CDF and checked the boards for the next train up the Valleys, it seemed we were destined for Treherbert. Ad Treherbert! We rolled off the platform, in a pacer, and towards the Valleys, this was soon to be a massive culture shock for James, lets go up the Valley's he said, it'd be fun he said, fun it was indeed and very humourous to Matthew.<br>
		We went 'north', soon to be known as west due to a map, but thats a small detail. Up past Cathays, Llandaff, Radyr, soon to be regular sights for us as we continued our masochism. We also noticed that it went from city to nice contryside, to lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of terraced houses, we knew this is where we shouldn't to be. We jumped off, took pictures and then jumped back on quickly at every station apart from Nantgarw, not to be left in the deepest darkest valley lines, although both of us slightly wishing for it. We got many diserning looks as we assended but just as we hit the terminus, somebody asked "'right boys, so what 'ewe doin' then?", we feared we were to be shanked or worse kidnapped and then killed. This was the first of many people asking us, what we were doing.  <br>
		The next stop was to go to Merthyr because we had a lot of time and it was time to try and get killed a second time! <blockquote>This isnt tourism its masochism </blockquote></p>
		<p>We went back to Pontypridd and ran from platform to platform in the rain and over the bridge, laughing at our lack of sanity (a regular occurance for these adventures), we joined a group of locals, with several family groups having seperate domestics, only stopping to stare at us. We alighted a double pacer and went back up north, the stations got slowly more and more desolate and poor. We stood in the wheelchair area while the people down the carriage taking drugs, looked at us in disdain for disturbing their illeagal obsessions.<br>
		At this point, it was dark, raining and everybody on the train was fearing for their lives. We carried on jumping on and off the train and drawing attention to ourselves, especially to by the bloke brandishing a knife and doing Ketamine, but we knew not about this as Benzene was in A2 Organic Chemistry. <br>
		As we pulled up to Merthyr Tydfil, after running down to the sign at Pentre-Bach, we noticed the very close proximity of the Tesco's. So it was time to go for a run, the guard told us: "We depart in 5 minutes boys", we had 5 minutes to explore Merthyr Tydfil Tescos and the attached shopping centre. Even while visiting it we knew this station was the be legendary in relation to NT stations and we still to this day aim to find the stations as legendary as Merthyr Tydfil Tesco, I dont think even Camborne beats it! Remember the station I mentioned in passing earlier? Nantgarw... or was it Treforest Estate, we got to tick that off on the way back, it was a wierd station, just one platform, in the middle of two tracks. I couldnt work out how it worked, but we just took the photo and jumped back on.<br>
		Now, you would think, we ticked off 22 stations, we did well, we can call it a day now. No, of course not, theres plenty more stations to tick off! So we arrived back to Cardiff Central, with our lives in our hands and disembarked with the druggies gang members and valley folk. At this point we were hungry and we decided on a classic Pizza Express, this was a recent discovery for us and soon to become a go-to for food with both of us knowing our orders without having to see the menu. The nuttyness was rekindled in us after some food and it was time to wait for the train, 'wait'...yeah... so we waited for the train and so following from waiting, we went and raced he train down the platform.<br>
		We went and got the 800 back to Swansea and Neath respectively and ticked off the rest of the stations on the Mainline PAD services.

<p> People say, fool me once, shame on me, fool me twice shame on you. We feel the same thing may not be true for the Valleys, as there was no fooling here, we went up by choice! So we started this one slightly later than the other NT adventures, but we still had plenty of time for insanity, don't you worry dear reader!'
1 trip up the valleys evidently wasn't enough to satiate our appetite for masochism, so just a few days after Christmas, we 
	headed back for more.

<div class="content">
	<p> <q>Jumping on and off trains to request-only platforms, on a line with 4 trains per day? What could go wrong?</q>
	</p>
	<p> Some people run marathons, in our younger years, these people were seemed as maniacs to us (Although, James is doing a half next march at Pembrey... god, it's in March?! I haven't started training yet.). Seeming we undertook this adventure, you dear reader must see us as hypocrites, as this was not a marathon it was an Ultra. $.5hrs of jumping on and off trains, continually in the middle of nowhere.
	<br>This adventure started like every other, Matthew going from Neath to Swansea, James getting on a bus to Swansea (The bus genes are still strong) and meeting at Swansea, this time at 9am ,in inticipation of the <em>0937 service to Shrewsbury, calling at... every little hamlet in the middle of nowhere!</em>. This was to be different from the Valley trips as this was planned, in relative advance.We were struck instantly with a delay, as we stood on the platform, with another prospective train nutter, he gleemed with excitement as he watch the two trains being unable to be parted. At this moment, we remembered back to our religious education and thought... "we need moses."<br>
	Luckily, after much pushing, shoving and huffing by the driver, the two seperated and now we were one step closer to the holy grail of Nutty Train adventures. Soon we were permitted to board, the one car extraviganza, that was to take us all the way up to shrewsbury. We showed the guard our valley rangers and before we boarded, with timetable in hand, James asked "Now, how many request stops can we call at?", the driver looked slightly puzzled, but at the same time had a gleam in his eyes, he replied, "Well I am sorry boys, we are on a tight schedule, not many", James quickly replied, "Not even Sugar Loaf?", the guard permitted us to stop at Sugar Loaf, for reasons we were to find out later. 
	<br> We were lucky with our guard as he was a jolly fellow and he liked what we were doing, I suppose it gets really really boring and samey uppa Heart of Wales.

	<p> Having visited seemingly every supermarket rail terminus in South Wales, and standing in the middle of a road, screaming, 
		"Run me over, 'en!", it was time for Matthew and James to admit they had a problem.
