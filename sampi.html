	    This was the first of the Nutty Trains adventures, although at the time it was very impromptu. Having just finished in college for the morning, just a few days before Christmas, Matthew decided to meet James. I feel that the following exchange should be quoted: <blockquote> J: Well, what are we going to do today?<br> M: You fancy going on the trains?<br> J: Valleys?<br> *both laughing*<br> M: Yes [eyes glowing with insanity]</blockquote></p>
	    <p>Without giving it any rational thought. we were off! At this point we hadn't decided where we were to go, but we knew we were destined for the valleys, the rules were made as we travelled to Cardiff on an Arriva Coradia. The tension built as we counted down the stations to the real start of NT.  We discovered the Valleys Ranger ticket, which allowed us unlimited travel throughout the valleys that day, which we purchased in Cardiff, to the great amusement of the ticket office staff. <br>
		When we arrived at CDF, we checked the boards for the next train up the Valleys, and it seemed we were destined for Treherbert. Ad Treherbert! We rolled off the platform, in a sprinter, and towards the Valleys, this was soon to be a massive culture shock for James, lets go up the Valley's he said, it'd be fun he said, fun it was indeed and very humourous to Matthew.<br>
		We went 'north', as the map led us to believe (we were actually travelling west), up past Cathays, Llandaff, Radyr, which soon became very familiar to us, after numerous escapades into the deepest, darkest fringes of 'civilisation', as we continued our masochism. To avoid the ire of commuters in Cardiff, we decided to switch carriages every time we visited a station. In this way, another NT rule was born, completely impromptu. Whilst still in the Cardiff city boundary, we noticed successive stations becoming quieter and more dilapidated, a sign of things to come.
		The city ended abruptly after Radyr, and we were surrounded by nice contryside, only for it to give way to a massive industrial estate, followed by miles and miles and miles of terraced houses, row after row. We were now penetrating the valleys. On the way up, we jumped off, took pictures and then jumped back on quickly at every station apart from Nantgarw, <s>the best station ever</s>, because the Treherbert train didn't call at Nantgarw. As we ascended further, evening drew in, and the forests clinging to the ever-steeper valley sides became shrouded in mist, then draped in a thick fog. 
	        The colour of the sky had acquired a faint brown tinge by the time we hit Treorchy, but we still weren't at the terminus. We got many puzzled looks on our upward journey - why would anyone put themselves through this torture? Someone asked 'right boys, so what 'ewe doin' then?', the first of many such people, on all our adventures. Treherbert was our first real taste of the valleys. We got out of the train, and stood on the single platform, in front of a row a terraced houses overlooking the railway. The track continued into a disused tunnel, stretching further up the valley. 
		The valley itself began to climb sharply, with the trees thinning and giving away to gorse and bracken, and a light rain was falling, feeling almost like a veil. It really looked like the end of the world. The village was similarly abandoned. Fewer than 5 passengers got on or off the train, no-one was waiting by the bus stop, and the streets of terraced houses were desolate and abandoned. It was startling to think that we were only about 10 miles away from home. It was almost as if we were in another world.<br>
		We got back on the train, and sat down to plan our next journey. Dusk was rapidly approaching and the rain was now very heavy, but we decided to change at Pontypridd and head to Merthyr Tydfil. We arrived in Pontypridd (surprisingly, a very nice and very large station) and ran from platform to platform in the rain and over the bridge, laughing at our lack of sanity (a regular occurance for these adventures - James would later remark that an NT adventure was more tiring than a parkrun), then joined a group of locals waiting on some dodgy side platform for our first pacer of the day to arrive - it was time to try and get killed a second time! <blockquote>This isnt tourism its masochism </blockquote></p>
		<p> The locals on the platform were diverse and varied - a real taste of the cosmopolitan nature of the valleys - several family groups having seperate domestics, stopping only to stare at us, ket-users, crack-users, spice-users and weed-users, all looking at us in disdain for disturbing their illegal obsessions, and the elderly women from up the valley, having finished their annual trip to the great city of Pontypridd, watching us outsiders like hawks. We alighted a double (class 800) pacer and went back up north, to torture ourselves once more. The stations got slowly more and more desolate and poor as night drew in. We stood in the wheelchair area whilst our fellow passengers enjoyed their drugs.<br>
		At this point, it was dark, raining and everybody on the train feared for their lives as the pacer hurled itself down the track, at speeds that felt illegal. The windows were shaking, the doors were opening mid-journey, the roof was leaking, half the seats were missing, water was streaming down the inside of the windows, and the brakes on the train screamed into life every time the train went too far over the speed limit, all in the pitch black of night. 
                We carried on jumping on and off the train and drawing attention to ourselves, especially to by the bloke brandishing a knife and doing Ketamine. All we knew about ketamine was that it contains Benzene ‚è£ (A2 Organic Chemistry). Fortunately, laughing maniacally every time something went wrong with the train, repeating "This is nuts, this is nuts, this is really, truly nuts" ad nauseam, and having an insane glint in our eyes kept the other passengers at bay. They weren't the most deranged ones on the train that day!<br>
		As we pulled into the wonderful town of Merthyr Tydfil, having just run down to the sign at Pentre-Bach, we noticed that the train had terminated in the middle of a Tesco car park. Duly, we renamed the station on our faithful (now historic) map as 'Merthyr Tydfil Tesco Station'. This was our cue to go for a run. The guard told us: "We depart in 5 minutes boys", so we had 5 minutes to explore Merthyr Tydfil Tesco. Despite this being only our first adventure, whilst visiting it we knew this station was to be legendary in relation to NT stations and we still to this day aim to find the stations as legendary as Merthyr Tydfil Tesco. It has even seen off fierce competition from Maesteg Asda Station, Fishguard Harbour and Camborne! We took our photo in front of the station sign, which was the first of many.<br>

	        Having thoroughly explored the entrance to Tesco, we got back on the train, and settled into the long journey back to Cardiff. On the way back down, we ticked off the final missing station, Nantgarw, which TfW insists is actually called 'Treforest Estate'. Rubbish. We got to tick that legendary station off on the way back. It is a weird station with just one island platform, in the middle of two tracks. James couldn't spot how it worked, so just took the photo and jumped back on, but Matthew, having already been there twice before, explained that it had some dodgy tunnel leading out from the centre, under the tracks, and onto a dirt track through an industrial zone. Legendary.<br>
		Having arrived in Cardiff, and with 22 stations ticked off, we'd done well, so you'd think called it a day then. No, of course not. There are plenty more stations to tick off! We arrived back to Cardiff Queen Street, with our lives in our hands and disembarked with the druggies gang members and valley folk. We ran to the side platform for the sprinter shuttle service to Cardiff Bay, and travelled down to tick off our final Cardiff/valleys station that day. At this point we were hungry and we decided on a classic Pizza Express, which was still a recent discovery for us and soon to become a go-to for food and another NT tradition. 
	        James made a mistake by ordering the hottest pizza they offered "Because quadrilaterals > circles", then proceeded to eat of all the mitigating goats cheese off the pizza, leaving only the spicy bits behind. He had a fun time enjoying the remainder of his meal, needless to say. As we headed back to the station, the nuttiness was rekindled in us after some food and it was time to 'wait' for the train. Yeah... instead of waiting, we walked to the end of the platform and then raced the train back down the platform. (Matthew won).<br>
		We headed back to Cardiff Central, then got a Class 800 back to Swansea and Neath respectively and ticked off the rest of the stations on the mainline PAD services. What an amazing end to our first full adventure.

<div class="content">
<p> People say, fool me once, shame on me, fool me twice shame on you. We feel the same thing may not be true for the Valleys, as there was no fooling here, we went up by choice! So we started this one slightly later than the other NT adventures, in the middle of the afternoon, but we still had plenty of time for insanity, don't you worry dear reader!'
1 trip up the valleys evidently wasn't enough to satiate our appetite for masochism, so just a few days after Christmas, we headed back for more. Armed with another Valleys Ranger ticket, we departed from Cardiff Central yet again, and jumped upon the first valley train we saw, this time up the Rhymney Valley! We initially followed the same tracks as on our last journey, but then curved eastwards to tackle possibly the dodgiest valley of them all. The Rhymney Valley was the longest of the valleys, with numerous stations to tick off. That meant plenty of running at various stations for James. 
It took us a while to work out where we were as we approached Caerphilly, as the town appeared to have multiple stations (it turns out it had 3). From the elevated track, we could see for miles - we could see the castle in the distance... and the town, unfortunately. Having gone up the valleys expecting steep gorges and narrow openings in the rock, the plain around Caerphilly disorientated Matthew a little, but we quickly progressed to nuttier valley towns, to make sure he was kept insane.
Fortunately, the track soon became nuttier, until we were held at a halt, awaiting the green signal to move onto the single track line. This was Matthew's first journey on a single track railway. We rattled up the line, now surrounded by the familar sights of terraced houses, valley sides that blotted out the sun in the late afternoon, disused mine workings, crowds of drug addicts having domestics, and the sight of old women glaring out of their windows at this new fangled train travelling way too fast through <u>their</u> village. 
On the way up, we unfortunately missed Gilfach Fargoed, due to the strange service pattern in the Rhymney Valley. We will visit Gilfach Fargoed one day, in order to tick it off as our final Valley Line station - the crowning glory on our trusty map. The train rattled all the way up to Rhymney, where we disembarked, to take our photo in front of the sign once more, continuing our tradition. It was getting dark already, so after wandering about the station and the vincinity for 10 minutes, we got back on the train to Cardiff. 
	<center><img src="./resources/photos/Rhymney.jpg"></center>
On the way back, we tucked into a bag of Salt and Vinegar crisps (which we'd been saving since Cardiff). Here was yet another NT tradition, forged in the fire of the valleys, on those early December adventures. When we approached Cardiff, James expressed a desire to do a Geoff and Vicky, so we disembarked at Heath High Level, and sprinted down the slippery staircase, along the main road, before turning down a dodgy alleyway to to Heath Low Level, on the City Line. The rickety pacer emerged from the tunnel a few minutes later, and we continued down the track to Cardiff Queen Street. Once again, we disembarked here, but this time, decided to wander through Cardiff City Centre. 
Fortunately, we had been hardened by the sights of the valleys, so no amount of violence or drug abuse could scare us now. We walked to St Davids shopping centre, and decided to try Nandos, to see what all the fuss was about, but were thoroughly underwhelmed. We reminisced about our school days and about what we'd been up to recently, before getting back on the train and heading home. A few days later, James had to head back to Cornwall, meaning this was the last NT adventure that Christmas.
